Migraine Overview and Market Opportunity
Migraine is a chronic and debilitating disorder characterized by recurrent attacks lasting four to 72 hours with multiple symptoms, including typically one-sided, pulsating headaches of moderate to severe pain intensity that are associated with nausea or vomiting, and/or sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) and sensitivity to light (photophobia). Migraines are often preceded by transient neurological warning symptoms, known as auras, which typically involve visual disturbances such as flashing lights, but may also involve numbness or tingling in parts of the body. Migraine is both widespread and disabling. The Migraine Research Foundation ranks migraine as the world's third most prevalent illness, and the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 rates migraine as the seventh highest specific cause of disability worldwide. According to the Migraine Research Foundation, in the United States, approximately 36 million individuals suffer from migraine attacks. While most sufferers experience migraine attacks once or twice per month, more than 4 million people have chronic migraine, defined as experiencing at least 15 headache days per month, of which at least eight are migraine, for more than three months. Others have episodic migraine, which is characterized by experiencing less than 15 migraine days per month. People with frequent episodes of migraine may progress to chronic migraine over time. Migraine attacks can last four hours or up to three days. More than 90% of individuals suffering from migraine attacks are unable to work or function normally during a migraine attack, with many experiencing comorbid conditions such as depression, anxiety and insomnia.
Triptans are the current first-line prescription therapy for the acute treatment of migraine, with over 13.9 million annual prescriptions in the United States. Despite the market for triptans being highly genericized, branded options continue to be popular. For example, even at a price of approximately $400-600/month, Maxalt is a commonly prescribed triptan. There has been minimal improvement in the standard treatment for migraine since the early 1990s. Reformulations of generic triptans or incremental improvements with new agents that target the same pathway are predicted to generate additional sales in the near

 term, but major sales growth for the migraine market are expected from novel therapeutics over the next several years. We believe that rimegepant will be a potential best-in-class small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist for the acute treatment of migraine and could achieve meaningful penetration of the market of migraine sufferers whose symptoms are not adequately addressed with current treatments. It is important to recognize that all migraine patients require acute treatment, including patients who take preventive medicine (as they typically do not eliminate all migraine attacks).
The prevention of migraine in the United States is a multi-billion dollar potential market. According to a report published by Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment, 38% to 50% of diagnosed migraine sufferers may be candidates for migraine prevention therapy. Currently, preventive medications approved for migraine include beta blockers, such as propranolol, topiramate, sodium valproate, and botulinum toxin ("Botox") (chronic migraine only) and generate nearly 10 million prescriptions annually. Three CGRP monoclonal antibodies (mABs) were approved in 2018 for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. There was rapid early uptake of this class, but utilization will be defined over the next 24 months.
In patients with high frequency and chronic migraine, beta blockers, topiramate and sodium valproate are commonly used to reduce the frequency of migraine. These medications are often not well tolerated by patients because of adverse events ("AEs") such as cognitive impairment, nausea, fatigue and sleep disturbance. In clinical trials with topiramate, the reduction in number of migraine days per month has been observed to be relatively small; for example, migraine days reduced by 2.5 days from six to seven days at baseline, or reduced by 3.5 days from 15 to 16 days at baseline. Migraine is twice as prevalent in women as compared to men. In the affected female patient population, predominantly women of child-bearing age, the association of these agents with poor pregnancy outcomes and fetal abnormalities can limit their use. Botox is only approved for the prevention of migraine in patients diagnosed with chronic migraine. Approximately 47% of Botox-treated patients experience a 50% reduction in either migraine days per month or migraine frequency per month within six months, which leaves more than half of patients inadequately treated. In addition, the Botox dosing regimen consists of approximately 31 subcutaneous injections at various sites on the head and neck, with recommended repetition every 12 weeks if the patient has a therapeutic response.
The CGRP mAbs have a similar profile across the agents approved to date. The three new FDA-approved drugs, Aimovig (erenumab-aooe), Ajovy (fremanezumab-vfrm), and Emgality (galcanezumab-gnlm), are all administered subcutaneously. The side effects from the new CGRP monoclonal antibody drugs are generally mild, including pain and redness at the site of injection and nasal congestion. Studies show that the monoclonal antibodies reduce the number of headache days by 50% or more in approximately half of the patients who take them. In only a small percentage of patients do these drugs eliminate migraine attacks, with the vast majority of patients also needing additional effective acute treatment. 
CGRP's Role in Migraine
The CGRP receptor is located within pain-signaling pathways, intracranial arteries and mast cells and its activation is thought to play a causal role in migraine pathophysiology. For example, research and clinical studies have shown serum levels of CGRP are elevated during migraine attacks, infusion of intravenous CGRP produces persistent pain in migraine sufferers and non-migraine sufferers, and treatment with anti-migraine drugs normalizes CGRP activity. Additionally, multiple clinical studies show that small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, which inhibit the binding of endogenous CGRP to CGRP receptors, are effective in the acute treatment of migraine attacks.
Treatment with a CGRP receptor antagonist is believed to relieve migraine through the following mechanisms:
•Blocking Neurogenic Inflammation:  Binding of CGRP receptor antagonists to CGRP receptors located on mast cells inhibits inflammation caused by trigeminal nerve release of CGRP onto mast cells within the tough outer covering of the brain, or the meninges.
•Decreasing Artery Dilation:  By blocking the CGRP receptors located in smooth muscle cells within vessel walls, CGRP receptor antagonists inhibit the pathologic dilation of intracranial arteries without the unwanted effect of active vasoconstriction.
•Inhibiting Pain Transmission:  Binding of CGRP receptor antagonists to CGRP receptors suppress the transmission of pain by inhibiting the central relay of exaggerated pain signals from the trigeminal nerve to the caudal trigeminal nucleus.

Our Lead Product Candidate: Rimegepant, an Oral CGRP Receptor Antagonist for the Acute and Preventive Treatment of Migraine
We are developing rimegepant as an orally available, selective and potent small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. The first indication being pursued is the acute treatment of migraine. We believe
Table of Contents

 that rimegepant has the potential to be the best-in-class CGRP receptor antagonist for the acute treatment of migraine with the ability to address important unmet needs, such as early onset of pain relief, durable efficacy of pain relief and relief from most bothersome symptoms and rapid return to normal function (decreased disability). Importantly, these benefits are noted without the cardiovascular contraindications of triptan therapy and/or the bothersome side effects that impact utilization. Additionally, oral small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists with high receptor affinity and long half-lives, such as rimegepant, may possess dual-therapy action with ability to provide both acute relief and preventive effects.
In July 2017, we initiated two Phase 3 clinical trials of rimegepant, and we completed enrollment in these trials in November 2017. Topline results from both of these Phase 3 trials were reported in March, 2018. The co-primary endpoints (pain freedom at 2 hours and reduction of most bothersome symptoms) were both met as well as key secondary endpoints (return to function, pain relief). These results are described in greater detail below under “—Our Clinical Program for Rimegepant in Acute Treatment of Migraine— Phase 3 Clinical Trials: Studies 301 and 302.”
Those suffering from migraine often have accompanying nausea and have an aversion to consuming food or liquids during an attack. We are also developing an oral solid dosage formulation of rimegepant that disperses almost instantly in the mouth, without the need for water. The Zydis oral dissolving tablet ("ODT") formulation being utilized uniquely addresses this issue. We have exclusive worldwide rights to the Zydis ODT fast-dissolving formulation for the development of rimegepant pursuant to a January 2018 license agreement with Catalent U.K. Swindon Zydis Limited, a subsidiary of Catalent, Inc. ("Catalent"). The agreement also provides exclusivity with respect to other small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists with the Zydis ODT technology. In February 2018, a bioequivalence study was conducted to compare this new ODT formulation to the tablet in current clinical development and provided evidence of equivalence. A third Phase 3 clinical trial evaluatiing the Zydis ODT formulation of rimegepant commenced in February 2018 and the results from this trial were reported in December 2018. 
Consistent with the prior Phase 3 studies, the ODT formulation met the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom and freedom from the most bothersome symptoms. Importantly the Zydis ODT formulation had a faster onset of action with rapid onset of pain relief beginning to show an effect as early as 15 minutes and becoming statistically significant by 60 minutes.  Furthermore, this study met 21 consecutive pre-specified, hierarchically tested outcome measures including durability of effect out to 48 hours post-dose without the use of rescue medication. Importantly, consistent with the other trials, placebo-level tolerability was also noted. These results are described in greater detail below under “—Our Clinical Program for Rimegepant in Acute Treatment of Migraine— Phase 3 Clinical Trials: Study 303.”
In December 2018 data became available from our ongoing rimegepant long-term safety study. The positive results from the interim analysis of this trial included over 91,000 doses of rimegepant 75 mg across 1,780 patients with migraine. The safety and tolerability profile of rimegepant with up to one year of dosing in patients with migraine was consistent with the safe and well tolerated profile previous seen in clinical trials with rimegepant. No liver safety signal was detected, including a subset of patients with near-daily dosing (≥15 doses/month). Additionally, preliminary efficacy observations suggest that intermittent dosing of rimegepant 75 mg may reduce the number of headache days per month and a separate, double-blind placebo controlled preventive treatment study with rimegepant is being conducted. Overall, safety and tolerability data from this interim analysis and ongoing data from this study are expected be sufficient to support new drug application ("NDA") submissions for the Zydis ODT and tablet formulations planned for second quarter of 2019.
Based on emerging data from repeat dosing of rimegepant in the long-term safety trial, a Phase 3 trial to evaluate rimegepant as a preventative treatment of migraine was initiated in November 2018. 
In November 2017, we received agreement from the FDA on an initial pediatric study plan. In 2018, we submitted requests for scientific advice for rimegepant to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP") a committee of the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") and feedback suggests there are several options for pursuing indications for rimegepant in Europe which are currently under consideration.
Additionally, in January 2019, we announced with our wholly-owned subsidiary, BioShin, that the National Medical Products Administration (formerly, the China FDA) has accepted the investigation new drug ("IND") application for rimegepant for the treatment of migraine. We had previously announced the formation of BioShin in November of 2018; the subsidiary was established to develop and potentially commercialize our late-stage migraine and neurological disorder product development portfolio in China and other Asia-Pacific markets.
Acute Treatment of Migraine and Limitation of Current Treatments
Clinicians use a number of pharmacologic agents for the acute treatment of migraine. A study published by the American Headache Society in 2015 concluded that the medications deemed effective for the acute treatment of migraine fell into the following classes: triptans, ergotamine derivatives, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ("NSAIDs"), opioids and combination medications. The current standard of care for the acute treatment of migraine is prescription of triptans, which are serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists. Triptans have been developed and approved for the acute treatment of migraine over the
Table of Contents

 past two decades. The initial introduction of triptans represented a shift toward drugs more selectively targeting the suspected pathophysiology of migraine. While triptans account for almost 80% of anti-migraine therapies prescribed at office visits by healthcare providers, issues such as an incomplete effect or headache recurrence remain important clinical limitations. In fact, for any given attack, almost 50% of patients take a second dose in search of pain relief. In addition, triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or significant risk factors for either because of potential systemic and cerebrovascular vasoconstriction from the 5-HT1B-mediated effects. The package insert for triptans includes warnings and precautions for migraine patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease and states that high risk patients, including those with increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity or a strong family history of coronary artery disease, should be evaluated prior to receiving the first dose of a triptan. Triptans are contraindicated in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm, history of stroke, peripheral vascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension. Even in patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, product labeling for triptans recommends that consideration be given to administration of the first dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram immediately following administration. Additionally, periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered for long-term users of triptans who have cardiovascular risk factors. According to a January 2017 study published in the journal Headache, an estimated 2.6 million migraine sufferers in the United States have a cardiovascular event, condition or procedure that limits the potential of triptans as a treatment option. Thus, we believe there remains a significant unmet medical need for a novel migraine-specific medication that does not increase the risk of cardiovascular liability.
The Potential Benefits of Rimegepant Compared to Other Treatments
Traditionally, for approval of drugs for the acute treatment of migraine, the FDA required the drug to meet four co-primary endpoints at two hours after dosage in clinical trials: pain freedom or pain relief, and freedom from nausea, phonophobia and photophobia. In October 2014, the FDA issued new guidance (and formal guidance in February 2018) indicating that pivotal migraine trials could use a preferred approach of co-primary 2-hour endpoints of freedom from pain and freedom from most bothersome symptom (among nausea, photophobia or phonophobia) to support approval.
The table below compares what we believe are key features of rimegepant contrasted to other product candidates and standard of care treatments for the acute treatment of migraine.*
*These are cross-trial comparisons and no comparative head-to-head studies between rimegepant and competitors have been conducted. 
Based on the results from the rimegepant clinical trials to date, we believe rimegepant offers the following clinical and product benefits for the acute treatment of migraine:
Table of Contents

•Oral Availability.  Rimegepant is the only oral CGRP currently formulated in a Zydis ODT that can be administered sublingually for the potential for rapid onset of action. In our Phase 3 clinical trial, the rimegepant Zydis ODT formulation demonstrated pain relief beginning as early as 15 minutes (becoming statistically significant by 60 minutes), with patients returning to normal functioning by 60 minutes. We have an exclusive worldwide agreement with Catalent for the use of rimegepant in the Zydis ODT fast-dissolving formulation (which also provides exclusivity with respect to other small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists with the Zydis ODT technology). We believe oral availability in an easy to use formulation will provide advantages over injectable migraine treatments. 
•Comprehensive Treatment Effect. Rimegepant has demonstrated consistent comprehensive treatment effect across 3 large Phase 3 trials and a Phase 2b trial with significant pain freedom, pain relief and relief from most bothersome symptoms. These effects were all noted with a single dose of the 75 mg tablet or ODT. The majority of patients treated with a single dose of rimegepant 75 mg did not require the use of additional rescue medications after treating their migraine. 
•Durable Improvement.  In the Phase 3 trials, rimegepant demonstrated durable impact on pain freedom and pain relief through 48 hours compared to placebo. We believe that this durability of effect is related to the half-life of rimegepant and is an important differentiator from other products that have a shorter half-life and require additional doses of medications or rescue medications. 
•Favorable Safety Profile.  In 3 Phase three studies of over 3500 patients, rimegepant demonstrated a safety profile similar to placebo. There were no AEs greater than 1.6%. Consistent with the preclinical data, there was no clinical evidence suggesting that rimegepant has vasoconstrictor activity or other undesirable cardiovascular side effects, such as changes in the blood pressure or heart rate, that are commonly associated with triptans. 
•Potency.  Rimegepant is highly potent with subnanomolar affinity for the human CGRP receptor, which allows for a relatively low dose to provide maximal treatment effect with a single 75 mg dose.
•Lower Expected Cost.  We expect that as a small molecule, rimegepant will have a lower cost of goods than CGRP antibodies, which are biologics.
The Potential of CGRP Antagonists: Novel mechanism of action without causing vasoconstriction
The release of the neuropeptide CGRP from pain nerves is believed to play a causal role in the underlying pathophysiology of migraine and is also a potent dilator of intracranial arteries. Unlike triptans, which possess potent vasoconstrictive properties that could worsen cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, blocking the CGRP receptor reverses pathologic dilation of blood vessels without constricting them past their normal resting state size and without active vasoconstriction. The absence of cardiovascular effects may prove to be one of the major advantages in the use of CGRP receptor antagonists for the treatment of migraine. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the use of CGRP receptor antagonists may be effective in treating migraine by blocking the pathophysiological processes associated with CGRP release, specifically by: (1) inhibiting pain transmission; (2) decreasing artery dilation without any active vasoconstriction; and (3) halting neurogenic inflammation. To date, the preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that CGRP receptor antagonists have an absence of vasoconstrictor activity and lack other undesirable cardiovascular side effects, such as changes in the blood pressure or heart rate. Studies of numerous drugs in development have provided proof of concept of the effects of CGRP targeting agents in humans.
Our Clinical Program for Rimegepant in Acute Treatment of Migraine
We licensed rimegepant from BMS in July 2016. BMS selected rimegepant as a lead CGRP receptor antagonist compound for its potential best-in-class chemical profile after 10 years of research on this drug target.
Phase 3 Clinical Trials: Studies 301 and 302
Based on favorable results observed in a Phase 2b clinical trial, we elected to advance the 75 mg dose of rimegepant in our Phase 3 clinical trials. According to FDA 2014 draft guidance for developing drugs for acute treatment of migraine, approval for this indication has historically involved the demonstration of an effect on four co-primary endpoints: pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia. More recently, the agency has considered an alternate approach and in the recently published FDA 2018 formal guidance indicated as the "preferred approach" for approval based on an effect at 2 hours on headache pain freedom and freedom from a patient's most bothersome migraine symptom, or MBS, selected as either nausea, photophobia or phonophobia. Using this approach, the two co-primary endpoints would be (1) having no headache pain at two hours after dosing and (2) a demonstrated effect on freedom from the MBS at two hours after dosing. Regardless of the associated symptom identified as most bothersome, the FDA guidance states that all three important migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) should be assessed as secondary endpoints.
Table of Contents

We held an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in March 2017 and commenced two Phase 3 clinical trials ("Study 301" and "Study 302") in July 2017 with the oral tablet. We completed enrollment in these trials in November 2017. Approximately 3,000 patients were enrolled and 2,300 patients randomized across these two Phase 3 trials. 
We believe that our Phase 3 trials of rimegepant 75 mg conform to the FDA guidance for approval in acute treatment of migraine. The trials were double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled. The first two Phase 3 trials treated subjects with the tablet version of rimegepant and recruited male and female patients 18-65 years of age with at least a one year history of migraine, including an age of onset prior to 50, migraine attacks that last about four to 72 hours, not more than eight attacks of moderate to severe intensity per month within the last three months and not less than two attacks per month. Our goal was to enroll patients who represent the spectrum of real-world migraine patients, including those who have previously been non-responsive to triptans, as the FDA stated to us at our end of Phase 2 meeting that triptan-resistant patients may benefit from rimegepant treatment. We also enrolled patients who had cardiovascular risk factors and/or vascular disease. The primary objective of the trials was to evaluate the efficacy of 75 mg of rimegepant compared with placebo in the acute treatment of migraine as measured by two co-primary endpoints: (1) pain freedom (headache pain intensity level reported as "no pain") at two hours after dosing using a four-point numeric rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain) and (2) freedom from the MBS at two hours after dosing. The three other important migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) were assessed as secondary endpoints, consistent with FDA guidance.
In March 2018, we announced positive topline data from our first two Phase 3 clinical trials of rimegepant. In each trial, treatment with a single 75 mg dose of rimegepant met the co-primary efficacy endpoints of the trial, which were superior to placebo, at two hours post-dose, on measures of pain freedom and freedom from the patient’s most bothersome symptom, or MBS, selected as either nausea, photophobia or phonophobia.
The figures below show, for each trial, Kaplan-Meier curves depicting the effect of rimegepant on pain freedom as compared to placebo over the course of eight hours after dosing. A Kaplan-Meier curve is a method of statistical analysis used to show estimates of data over time even though data was only collected at intervals throughout that time period.
Kaplan-Meier Curve Showing Pain Freedom 0-8 Hours Post-Dosing
Rimegepant showed a numerical improvement in pain freedom as compared to placebo as early as 45-60 minutes post-dosing, with continued improvement over the course of eight hours post-dosing. The magnitude of the treatment effect over placebo at two hours post-dosing or later, as shown in the figures above, ranged from 5% to 19% in Study 301 and 7% to 22% in Study 302. This continued improvement in pain freedom was observed in patients who received a single dose of rimegepant and did not use rescue medications. Rescue medications are additional medications that patients in clinical trials may take concurrently with the study drug or placebo after the 2 hour endpoint has been registered when the patient experiences inadequate relief. Each of the figures above excludes patients who took rescue medication or who were lost to follow-up during the specified interval.
Pain freedom at two hours post-dosing, one of the co-primary endpoints of these trials, was 19.2% and 19.6% for rimegepant-treated patients in Study 301 and 302, respectively, as compared to 14.2% and 12.0% for patients receiving placebo, with corresponding p-values of <0.03 and <0.001, respectively. P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the
Table of Contents

 statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of 0.05 or less represents statistical significance, meaning that there is a less than 1-in-20 likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. The table below summarizes these results.
Rimegepant also achieved statistically significant results on a second co-primary endpoint, freedom from MBS, selected from photophobia, phonophobia or nausea, at two hours post-dosing. As shown in the table below, freedom from MBS for patients treated with rimegepant were 36.6% and 37.6% in Study 301 and Study 302, respectively, as compared to 27.7% and 25.2% for patients receiving placebo, with corresponding p-values of <0.002 and <0.0001, respectively.

We also evaluated rimegepant’ s effect on pain relief, which is the transition from experiencing moderate-to-severe pain to either no pain or mild pain, as a secondary endpoint in both trials. Although pain relief does not always indicate that a patient has no pain, unlike pain freedom, it is a clinically important endpoint because it often is associated with reduced disability due to migraine attacks. In each of the Phase 3 trials, onset of pain relief in patients treated with rimegepant was observed early after dosing, with separation between rimegepant and placebo evident between 30 and 45 minutes post-dosing. In both trials, by two hours post-dosing, over 55% of patients receiving only a single dose of rimegepant achieved pain relief (p-values of 0.0006 in Study 301 and <0.0001 in Study 302). The figures below show, for each trial, Kaplan-Meier curves depicting the effect of rimegepant on pain relief as compared to placebo over the course of eight hours after dosing.

Each of the figures above excludes patients who took rescue medication or who were lost to follow-up during the specified interval.

In addition to achieving both co-primary endpoints in each of the trials, rimegepant also was observed to be generally well-tolerated in the trials, with a safety profile similar to placebo. In particular, pooled liver function test, or LFT, results showed that rimegepant was no more likely than placebo to increase ALT or AST levels above the upper limit of normal, or ULN. An LFT is a blood test that gives an indication of whether the liver is functioning properly. Across both trials, one patient treated with placebo and one patient treated with rimegepant showed LFTs above 3x ULN. 
In both trials, no single adverse event, or AE, occurred with an incidence higher than 2% and the overall AE rates in the rimegepant groups were similar to those in the placebo groups. The most common AEs seen in patients treated with rimegepant were similar to placebo in a pooled analysis of both trials. There were no serious adverse events, or SAEs, determined by the study investigators to be drug related. 
Phase 3 Clinical Trials: Study 303
Our third Phase 3 trial was a randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial (“Study 303”) evaluating the efficacy and safety of rimegepant 75 mg Zydis ODT conducted with the rimegepant 75 mg Zydis ODT and was initiated after bioequivalence between the tablet and ODT were established. This Phase 3 Zydis ODT sStudy 303 was conducted to further characterize the ODT formulation and was designed in keeping with the previous Phase 3 studies.
In December 2018, we announced positive topline data from Study 303. In Study 303, rimegepant Zydis ODT statistically differentiated from placebo on the two co-primary endpoints as well as the first 21 consecutive primary and secondary outcome measures that were pre-specified in hierarchical testing. Consistent with the two previous Phase 3 clinical trials, Study 303 met its co-primary endpoints of pain freedom and freedom from most bothersome symptom (MBS) at 2 hours using a single dose (Table 1). Importantly, patients treated with the rimegepant Zydis ODT formulation began to numerically separate from placebo on pain relief as early as 15 minutes, and this difference was statistically significant at 60 minutes (p < 0.0001) (Figure 1). Additionally, a significantly greater percentage of patients treated with rimegepant Zydis ODT returned to normal functioning by 60 minutes as compared to placebo (p < 0.002). Lasting clinical benefit was observed through 48 hours after a single dose of rimegepant on freedom from pain (p < 0.001), pain relief (p < 0.001), freedom from the most bothersome symptom (p < 0.001), and freedom from functional disability (p < 0.003). Superiority over placebo was also demonstrated in multiple other secondary endpoints. The vast majority of rimegepant Zydis ODT treated patients (85%) did not use any rescue medications.

Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients reporting pain relief between 0 and 2 hours after dosing for patients who took a single dose of rimegepant Zydis ODT 75 mg or placebo. Data are Kaplan-Meier estimates of the time to first report of pain relief (report of no pain, or mild pain). Subjects were censored who took rescue medication or were lost to follow-up. 

The safety and tolerability observations of rimegepant in Study 303 were consistent with the profile previously observed in Studies 301 and 302. Table 2 shows the pooled safety data across all three trials. In study 303, no single adverse event (AE) occurred in the rimegepant group with an incidence higher than 1.6% and overall rates of AEs were similar to placebo. With regard to liver function tests, one patient treated with placebo and one patient treated with rimegepant showed LFTs > 3x ULN in Study 303. Pooled liver function test results across the three pivotal trials (n=3,556) performed to date showed that rimegepant was similar to placebo with regard to aminotransferase (ALT or AST) levels above the upper limit of normal (ULN) and no patients experienced elevations in bilirubin > 2x ULN (Table 3).

Phase 3 Clinical Trials: Long-term Safety Study (Study 201)
In August 2017, we commenced a long-term safety study ("Study 201") to meet FDA requirements for approval. This study is a 12-month, long-term, open label safety study conducted in patients with migraine. Approximately 2,000 patients will be treated in this study. A subset of approximately 600 patients will have a history of more frequent migraine attacks (i.e., more than eight migraine attacks per month) and will be able to take up to 30 doses of 75 mg rimegepant in one month. At our end of Phase 2 meeting, the FDA stated its desire to see a safety study in which patients received daily or near-daily dosing of rimegepant for at least three months. This desire stems from the FDA's concern about a potential liver signal with the class of CGRP antagonists. The FDA stated that any risk of liver injury has to be very low and that exposure with the drug has to be sufficient to cap the risk of liver injury at a level acceptable for the migraine population. We believe the design of our long-term safety study may adequately address this concern by providing for the enrollment of approximately 600 patients who experience nine to fourteen migraine episodes per month and will be allowed to use rimegepant on a daily basis, which we believe will generate safety data with respect to long-term, frequent use of rimegepant. Importantly, we believe this study design, where patients are allowed to take up to 30 doses of 75 mg rimegepant in one month, embraces the FDA guidance for conduct of a long-term safety trial during which patients can treat all acute migraine episodes with the investigational drug. Study visits for all patients are monthly for the first three months and every three months thereafter. Based on feedback we received at our end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, we are administering liver function testing at two weeks post-dose and will follow patients with any abnormal liver function tests until clinical resolution. 
On December 10, 2018, we announced initial positive results from the ongoing safety study. As of November 21, 2018 (the database cutoff date of the interim assessment), Over 91,000 doses of rimegepant 75mg had been administered across 1,780 patients with migraine, and approximately 473 of those patients had received near daily dosing (15 or more doses a month) of rimegepant 75 mg for a duration of 1-12 months. Based on this interim analysis, it appears that rimegepant may be safe and well tolerated with long-term dosing in patients with migraine. 
The interim results also include hepatic safety and tolerability data of rimegepant 75 mg in study participants based upon review of both adverse events and regularly scheduled liver function tests. Interim hepatic data were reviewed by an external independent panel of liver experts. The panel provided a consensus opinion based upon the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) causality assessment. The panel did not assess any liver cases as probably related to study drug and there were no Hy’s Law cases identified. The panel concluded that there was no liver safety signal detected through the data analysis cut-off date, including in a subset of patients with near-daily dosing (> 15 doses/month). In aggregate, the panel noted that, compared to placebo arms of other migraine treatments, there was a very low incidence of overall elevations of liver laboratory abnormalities (1.0% incidence of serum ALT or AST > 3xULN). Subjects will continue to participate in Study 201 with additional data analyses to be submitted to the FDA in connection with the planned NDA submissions, including the required 120-day safety update.
The most common individual AEs (occurring > 5%) in Study 201 were upper respiratory tract infection and viral respiratory tract infection. There were low rates of discontinuation due to AEs in the treatment period (2.6%).
In addition to the interim safety analysis, preliminary open-label efficacy data from Study 201 suggest that rimegepant may be associated with a reduction in migraine days per month (30 days) compared to the observational lead-in period, suggesting a potential preventive effect. In an exploratory analysis, patients who experienced > 15 migraine days/month (N=172) during the standard of care observation period demonstrated a mean reduction of 4 headache days/month by 12 weeks
Table of Contents

 of intermittent dosing with rimegepant. Reduction from baseline in the mean number of headache days per month was observed beginning as early as the first month and continued in subsequent months of therapy. 
In addition to Study 201, clinical monitoring for potential hepatotoxicity has been and will continue to be conducted in subsequent studies in humans. Such monitoring will include routine liver function tests including ALT, AST, total bilirubin, GGT and ALP at all study phases, including screening (before exposure to rimegepant), regularly during exposure, and after exposure. Additionally, the frequency, severity, and discontinuations of hepatic-related AEs are monitored closely. All cases of DILI are reported as SAEs. Other symptoms or target organs from nonclinical studies that will continue to be followed include skeletal muscle effects, emesis, skin rash and hematology measures. The two-year carcinogenicity study completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and we expect to receive the study report in 2019.
Our Clinical Program for Rimegepant in Preventative Treatment of Migraine
A Phase 3 clinical trial in the preventive treatment of migraine was initiated in November of 2018 to examine the efficacy and safety of rimegepant 75 mg dosed on an intermittent schedule planned for 800 adult subjects who have suffered from migraine for at least one year and who have a frequency of 4 to 14 migraine attacks of moderate to severe pain intensity per month over the three months prior to enrollment. The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline at week 12 in the mean number of migraine days per month. Secondary outcome measures include the achievement of at least a 50% reduction from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the double-blind treatment phase, and the mean number of rescue medication days per month, each as measured over the course of the double-blind, treatment phase. We expect to report topline results from this trial in 2019.
Clinical Trials with Rimegepant
As of February 2019, nineteen clinical trials have been completed (enrollment and treatment completed) in healthy volunteers and patients with migraine that inform pharmacokinetic, metabolic interactions, safety, tolerability and efficacy of rimegepant. Rimegepant has been observed to be generally well tolerated in humans when given as single oral doses up to the maximum dose of 1500 mg and multiple oral doses up to the maximum daily dose of 600 mg for 14 days. No deaths have occurred in clinical trials to date. Currently, we are continuing to conduct one Phase 3 clinical trial in preventive treatment of migraine, and the long-term safety study as well as one Phase 1 clinical trial, with one more Phase 1 clinical trialexpected to commence in the second quarter of 2019. These Phase 1 trials included evaluation of important drug-drug interactions looking at the effect of administering itraconazole, rifampin or fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics ("PK") of rimegepant. Also included are population studies to evaluate any differences seen in PK in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, cardiac conduction effects, as well as differences in PK that could be seen in the elderly. 
As of February 2019, over 3,500 patients have been administered rimegepant across all studies. In completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 rimegepant clinical trials, for which all subjects have completed treatment, SAEs have been reported with none of these SAEs considered to be related to study drug. In total, we believe the current data suggests a favorable benefit-risk profile for rimegepant in the acute treatment of migraine attacks. The clinical experience with rimegepant to date has allowed the characterization of safety and tolerability at substantial multiples of the intended therapeutic dose and intended frequency of use. Rimegepant has been assessed in single doses up to 1500 mg and in multiple doses from 75 mg to 600 mg with 14 days of dosing (including 300 mg twice daily), where the higher doses yielded exposures more than 54 times greater in area under the curve ("AUC"), which is a measure of drug exposure, and 23 times higher in Cmax, which is the peak concentration that a drug achieves after dosing, as compared to the mean therapeutic exposure of a single 75 mg dose. These high exposure multiples were observed to be generally well tolerated.
Since no data are available regarding the effects of rimegepant on human fetuses or newborns, women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control and have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test to be eligible to receive rimegepant. Female subjects should avoid attempts at pregnancy in the month prior to exposure to rimegepant and eight weeks after exposure to rimegepant. All urine pregnancy testing results must be confirmed by serum pregnancy testing. Drug interaction studies with oral contraceptives demonstrated modest increase in exposure to estrogen and norelgestromin upon multiple doses of rimegepant 75 mg. Co-administration of rimegepant with oral contraceptives was safe and well tolerated. These results enabled enrollment of women of child bearing potential receiving oral contraceptives to be enrolled in the Phase 3 studies.
Nonclinical Toxicology
Rimegepant is not genotoxic or phototoxic and has a low potential for off-target receptor interactions or effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems ("CNS"). With repeated dosing up to three months, rimegepant was clinically tolerated at up to 150 mg/kg/day in rats and 100 mg/kg/day in monkeys. No histopathologic liver findings were noted in monkeys treated for 3 months at all doses (the highest dose yielded an AUC exposure that was 120× the anticipated human AUC at a therapeutic dose of 75 mg/day). The liver was the primary target organ in mice at levels of 100 mg/kg/day and greater and in rats at levels of 60 mg/kg/day and greater. These dosing levels were not associated with hepatocellular degeneration

/necrosis, inflammation, or fibrosis. In monkeys treated for 3 months, target organ effects were limited to minimal to moderate macrophage accumulation (histiocytosis) in mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes (considered to be a marginal exacerbation of a common spontaneous change in this species) at 100 mg/kg/day. Hepatic lipidosis identified in mouse and rat studies was determined to be rodent specific as it was not observed at rimegepant exposures in monkeys which overlapped those producing lipid effects in rats in the three-month pivotal studies. At the NOEL (no observable effect level) and NOAEL (no observable adverse effect level) doses in rats (30 mg/kg/day) and monkeys (50 mg/kg/day) in the three-month studies, mean (male and female combined) AUC exposures were at least 23× (for rats) and 56× (for monkeys) the anticipated human AUC at a 75 mg/day clinical dose. Since fetal effects in rats were observed only at doses that produced maternal toxicity (300 mg/kg/day) and there were no fetal findings in rabbits at any dose level, rimegepant is not considered to be a selective developmental toxicant.
In a 6-month rat study, animals were administered rimegepant orally at daily doses of 0, 20, or 45 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was the high dose, 45 mg/kg/day with no evidence of toxicity at any dose. In a 9-month cynomolgus monkey study, animals were administered rimegepant orally at daily doses of 0, 15 or 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was the high dose, 50 mg/kg/day with no evidence of toxicity at any dose level. Chronic administration to rats (6 months) and monkeys (9 months) demonstrated NOAEL values at doses of 45 and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively. Exposures were at least 29X (rat) and 17X (monkey) the anticipated human AUC at a 75 mg/day clinical dose.
Our Product Candidate BHV-3500, a CGRP Receptor Antagonist for Acute and Preventive Treatment of Migraine
BHV-3500 is the second compound from our CGRP receptor antagonist platform and represents a novel chemical structure compared to other small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists in development (including rimegepant). We are developing BHV-3500 for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine, with initial studies being conducted in acute treatment, and we believe it has the potential to improve the existing standard of care based on the following benefits:
•Multiple Potential Routes of Delivery—BHV-3500 may be used by nasal, subcutaneous, inhalation or potential oral routes of administration with rapid onset of treatment effect, compared to the anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies ("mAbs") that are currently available which have a more cumbersome route of administration to patients in the form of intravenous or subcutaneous use. The first formulation of BHV-3500 in clinical trials is for intranasal delivery that will be assessed for rapid onset of action in the acute treatment of migraine.
•Favorable Safety Profile—Like rimegepant, we believe BHV-3500 will have a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the clinic, attributable to multiple properties such as its high selectivity for the CGRP receptor, low propensity to aggregate in lipids, and its expected excretion from the body in a largely unchanged state. Unlike other small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists that show potential for liver effects at high exposures, BHV-3500 has not demonstrated any propensity for liver abnormalities in preclinical studies to date, even at very high dose levels. Because preventative treatments involve chronic dosing on a daily basis, any potential target organ effects on the liver could be problematic. Therefore, based on these observations from nonclinical toxicology studies, we believe that BHV-3500 may provide a substantial benefit over other agents with such propensities. In addition, in preclinical studies of BHV-3500, no significant cardiovascular safety or systemic toxicity issues were observed, in contrast to sumatriptan, which displays dose-dependent vasoconstriction.
•Superior Chemical Attributes—BHV-3500 is a highly soluble, potent antagonist at the human CGRP receptor. Because BHV-3500 exhibits an in vitro and in vivo efficacy profile similar to rimegepant, we believe that BHV-3500 will also have a comprehensive (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) and durable efficacy profile. The chemical attributes of BHV-3500 also allow for a variety of formulations that may provide a more rapid onset of efficacy. Unlike mAbs, which are large biologic molecules, BHV-3500 is a small molecule that directly binds with high potency to the human CGRP receptor.
•Higher Value to Patients and Payors with Lower Expected Cost Compared to Biologics—We expect that as a small molecule, BHV-3500 will have a lower cost of goods than mAbs, which are biologics.
•Potential for Multiple Indications—Although its nonclinical safety and efficacy profile suggests BHV-3500's potential for daily administration and development for prevention of migraine, we believe this compound also has the potential to be developed in the acute treatment of migraine. BHV-3500 adds flexibility to our CGRP development program as a stand-alone agent for prevention therapy or a complementary intranasal formulation for rapid onset of action in the acute treatment of migraine.
We believe BHV-3500 has the potential to address a significant unmet need in the acute treatment of migraine in patients by delivering a faster onset of action and relief of migraine. This profile will enable it to compete effectively with current and future migraine therapies. BHV-3500 may afford multiple routes of delivery including intranasal delivery and daily oral

 administration for acute and preventative treatment of migraine, potential for enhanced safety profile, superior chemical attributes and a higher value to patients and payors with lower expected costs compared to large molecule biologics in current development.
Clinical Development Plans
Administration of intranasal BHV-3500 in a Phase 1 clinical trial was initiated in October 2018 and has achieved targeted therapeutic exposures. The compound is expected to advance into a Phase 2/3 trial to evaluate efficacy for the acute treatment of migraine in 2019. We believe that intranasal BHV-3500 may provide a ultra-rapid onset of action that could be used in a complimentary fashion with other migraine treatment when the speed of onset is critical to a patient. We are also planning to initiate a Phase 2 proof of concept trial in the second quarter 2019 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rimegepant in patients with treatment refractory trigeminal neuralgia at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
Our Glutamate Platform
We are developing three product candidates, troriluzole, BHV-0223 and BHV-5000, that modulate the glutamate system via two distinct mechanisms which form the basis of our glutamate platform—glutamate transporter modulators (troriluzole and BHV-0223) and glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate ("NMDA") receptor antagonists (BHV-5000).
Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter present in over 90% of all brain synapses and is a naturally occurring molecule that nerve cells use to send signals to other cells in the central nervous system. Glutamate plays an essential role in normal brain functioning and its levels must be tightly regulated. Abnormalities in glutamate function can disrupt nerve health and communication, and in extreme cases may lead to nerve cell death. Nerve cell dysfunction and death leads to devastating diseases, including ataxia, ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders. Glutamate clearance is necessary for proper synaptic activation and to prevent neuronal damage from excessive activation of glutamate receptors. Excitatory amino-acid transporters ("EAATs"), help regulate glutamate clearance, and are responsible for most of the glutamate uptake within the brain.
The mechanism of action of our glutamate platform is depicted below. Glutamate must be tightly regulated once released from a pre-synaptic neuron and acts as a signaling neurotransmitter to stimulate the post-synaptic neuron via stimulation of glutamate receptors (e.g., NMDA, AMPA or Kainate receptors). Glial cells surrounding the synaptic junction are predominantly responsible for clearing glutamate through transporters, the EAATs. There are five distinct types of glutamate transporters. (1) As depicted in the glial cell to the right of the figure below, BHV-0223 and troriluzole increase the activity of the EAATs to increase the clearance of glutamate and decrease glutamate release from the pre-synaptic neuron. Troriluzole and BHV-0223 also inhibit presynaptic ion channels that may inhibit the release of glutamate from presynaptic neurons. (2) As depicted in the postsynaptic neuron to the bottom of the figure below, BHV-5000 blocks glutamate signaling that is mediated by post-synaptic NMDA receptors. Modulating glutamate also has the potential to be neuroprotective and increase the release of neurotrophic factors, including brain derived neurotrophic factor ("BDNF") which are endogenous molecules that help to support the survival of existing neurons, and encourage the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses.

Glutamate Transporter Modulation
Abnormal glutamate release or dysfunction of glutamate clearance can cause overstimulation of glutamate receptors which can lead to a dangerous neural injury called excitotoxicity, which has been associated with a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases. The FDA has approved anti-excitotoxicity drugs that act on the glutamatergic system by blocking NMDA receptors, such as memantine ("Namenda") for Alzheimer's disease, lamotrigine ("Lamictal") for epilepsy and bipolar disorder and riluzole ("Rilutek") for ALS. Although these drugs show the therapeutic potential of glutamate receptor antagonists in the treatment of a range of neurological diseases, many of these approved drugs have serious side effects and other drawbacks that we have attempted to solve with our development of BHV-0223 and troriluzole.
We are currently developing troriluzole as a potential FDA-approved drug treatment option for patients suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder ("OCD"), Alzheimer's disease, ataxia (initially focusing on SCA) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder ("GAD"). We commenced a Phase 2/3 double-blind, randomized controlled trial on the use of troriluzole in OCD in December 2017, which is expected to complete enrollment in 2019. In addition, a Phase 2/3 double-blind, randomized controlled trial of troriluzole in the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease  in collaboration with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, a consortium of sites funded by the National Institutes of Health, is currently enrolling study subjects. A futility analysis will be conducted when approximately 100 randomized subjects have reached approximately 24 weeks of dosing, by the end of 2019. The 48-week extension phase of the SCA Phase 2/3 trial is complete and the extension phase has been expanded to 96-weeks. We expect to receive the data from that portion of the trial by the end of 2019. The Phase 2/3 double-blind, randomized controlled trial of troriluzole in GAD has started enrolling subjects and is expected to complete enrollment in 2019.
OCD is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms of obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors) that can interfere with patients' functional abilities. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the 12-month prevalence of OCD is 1% of the U.S. adult population, and approximately half of these cases are characterized as severe. First-line treatment for OCD includes cognitive behavior therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ("SSRIs") and adjunctive use of atypical antipsychotics. Nonetheless, up to 60% of patients have an inadequate response to conventional intervention strategies. While SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics have been approved for OCD, the majority of patients do not have an adequate response to pharmacologic treatment, and some seek invasive neurosurgical procedures to ameliorate symptoms. Despite the significant public health burden, no novel mechanisms of action have been approved by the FDA for OCD in over two decades. The rationale for use of troriluzole in OCD is supported by clinical data with its active metabolite, riluzole, in populations with OCD in open-label and placebo-controlled clinical trials as well as in preclinical, genetic and neuroimaging studies implicating the glutamatergic hyperactivity in the pathogenesis of OCD.
Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, characterized by symptoms of progressive memory loss and impairment in other areas of cognition. According to the Alzheimer's Association, approximately 5.5 million people in the United States are affected by the disease and, with the aging population, that number is expected to triple by 2050. We believe the rationale for the study of troriluzole in Alzheimer's disease is supported by preclinical studies on the active metabolite, riluzole, in multiple relevant preclinical models and our own clinical data from the Phase 2/3 clinical trial on the potential of troriluzole to overcome limitations of administering riluzole.
SCA represents an orphan disease. According to a 2016 report by Orphanet cataloging the prevalence and incidence of rare diseases, SCA affects approximately 22,000 individuals in the United States. We have received both orphan drug designation and fast track designation from the FDA for troriluzole for the treatment of SCA. In October 2017, we reported topline data from the 8-week randomization period from the Phase 2/3 clinical trial in SCA. At the eight week time point, troriluzole did not statistically differentiate from placebo. Post-hoc analyses suggested the potential for favorable therapeutic effects of troriluzole, based on numerically superior treatment effects compared to placebo in groups of subjects with less inherent pre-randomization variability on the primary endpoint and also in those, who based on baseline characteristics, would be expected to have greater drug exposures. In the trial, we observed a favorable safety and tolerability profile. For example, no subjects demonstrated an elevation of liver transaminases of 3-fold or greater than the upper limit of normal; whereas, a similar exposure of the active metabolite, riluzole, is associated with about an 8% rate of such elevations, based on the Rilutek Prescribing Information. The 96-week extension phase of the SCA trial is ongoing, and we are continuing to assess the data from the trial. Based on post-hoc analyses we are in active dialogue with the FDA to discuss the potential for further development of troriluzole in ataxias and the FDA has expressed willingness to accept a modification of our trial's primary endpoint, the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia ("SARA"), as an acceptable registrational endpoint. 
GAD represents a disorder of significant unmet need, affecting approximately 4.3% of the population at some point in their life.  Approximately one-third of cases are considered severe. GAD is a chronic condition characterized by excessive anxiety and worry that is out of proportion to actual context and causes significant distress or functional impairment. Rates of full remission have been observed to be low, with recovery rates from the index episode of less than 60% after a 12-year follow-up. In clinical studies of approved treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) the rates of remission are typically less than 50%. The social impact includes increased risk of not marrying, absenteeism, increased risk of suicide, and high healthcare costs. Minimal research has been conducted on the treatment of

 GAD that has not responded to conventional therapy. Frequently treatment-resistant patients are adjunctively administered benzodiazepines despite the potential for abuse and consequently symptom exacerbation. Based on the unmet medical need described above, additional treatments are required for populations with GAD that has not responded adequately to pharmacotherapy.
In addition, preclinical and small-scale pilot studies are underway to explore troriluzole's use in the treatment of a pipeline of other indications such as some cancers whose spread is thought mediated by glutamate transmission, such as melanoma and glioblastoma. We are also developing analogs of troriluzole and other related prodrugs for potential use in these indications.
An NDA for ALS was filed for BHV-0223 with the FDA in September 2018 with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") date of July 2019. According to the ALS Association, ALS affects up to 20,000 individuals in the United States and according to industry data, we estimate 15,000 individuals are clinically diagnosed, with 7,500 ALS patients actively treated with generic riluzole or branded Rilutek. As the first of two drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of ALS and the only drug to extend life and/or time to tracheostomy, riluzole is the established standard of care. However, while the market is highly genericized, there have been limited further clinical improvements or advances in ALS riluzole therapeutics since the FDA's approval in 1995. In addition, the use of riluzole is limited by a number of non-desirable attributes. We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for BHV-0223 in ALS and we have observed results suggesting bioequivalence to Rilutek in a recently completed Phase 1 clinical trial. We believe that BHV-0223, if approved, could gain meaningful market share based on its favorable formulation attributes.
BHV-5000 is an orally available, first-in-class, low-trapping, NMDA receptor antagonist prodrug that we are developing for the treatment of neuropsychiatric indications. One of these indications may include Rett syndrome. Rett syndrome is a rare and severe genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. After six to 18 months of apparently normal post-natal development, patients with Rett syndrome develop global deceleration of psychomotor function, loss of acquired cognitive skills and brain-mediated episodes of transient respiratory suppression. With intensive care, patients may survive into adulthood, yet they are severely physically and cognitively impaired. Rett syndrome affects approximately 15,000 individuals in the United States. No approved drug therapies for Rett syndrome are currently available and care is supportive. The rationale for the study of BHV-5000 in Rett syndrome is based on results of studies with BHV-5000, its active metabolite and ketamine in preclinical mouse models, in which improvement in key clinical features of the disease have been observed, including a reduction in the frequency of episodes of respiratory suppression. These preclinical findings are supported by anecdotal clinical reports regarding the use of ketamine, another NMDA receptor antagonist, in patients with Rett syndrome that have been reported to also show clinical improvements. Other potential indications include neuropathic pain and major depression.
Our Product Candidate Troriluzole for Ataxias, OCD, Alzheimer's Disease and Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Troriluzole is a new chemical entity ("NCE") and tripeptide prodrug of the active metabolite, riluzole. Based on its mechanism of action, preclinical data and clinical studies, troriluzole has potential for therapeutic benefit in a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric illnesses. Initial development has focused on its use in treating SCA, an orphan neurological indication that currently has no approved drug therapies and for which the active metabolite, riluzole, has demonstrated preliminary efficacy in two prior randomized controlled trials conducted by third parties. We acquired troriluzole from ALS Biopharma, LLC ("ALS Biopharma"), and Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc. ("FCCDC"), along with an estate of over 300 prodrugs. A prodrug is a compound that, after administration, is metabolized in the body into an active drug. Troriluzole is actively transported by virtue of recognition of its tripeptide moiety by the PepT1 transporter in the gut, and is responsible for the increased bioavailability of the drug. Once inside the body, the prodrug, troriluzole is cleaved by enzymes in the blood to the active metabolite riluzole. To mitigate the limitations of riluzole, several classes of prodrugs were designed, synthesized, and evaluated in multiple in vitro stability assays that predict in vivo drug levels. Troriluzole is a third generation of prodrug development and the product of six years of intensive chemistry efforts.
Riluzole is currently only indicated for ALS and has a number of non-desirable attributes that have limited its clinical use. Key limitations of riluzole include:
•Poor oral bioavailability—When riluzole is administered in a tablet form, approximately 40% is either not absorbed or is metabolized in the liver before reaching systemic circulation. The fraction that does not reach systemic circulation and does not contribute to efficacy only increases the drug burden to the liver. This is thought to contribute to its negative safety effects, such as the liver effects described below.
•Only tablet formulation currently available in United States—It is difficult for many patients with ALS to swallow, as oral and laryngeal dysfunction can be an early symptom of ALS. Such patients may choose to crush the tablets and mix it with food to make them easier to swallow; however, this is thought to decrease bioavailability.
Table of Contents

•Negative food effect—Riluzole must be taken on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or two hours after a meal, and failure to adhere to these guidelines results in lower drug levels and potentially decreased therapeutic effects. This can be particularly challenging for late-stage ALS patients who require a feeding tube for nutrition.
•Negative effect on liver—Riluzole has been shown to have dose-dependent liver effects that include elevations on liver function tests. Taking riluzole necessitates regular laboratory monitoring of liver function. In addition, according to the FDA's warnings and precautions for Rilutek in its U.S. prescribing information, cases of clinical hepatitis, one of which has been fatal, have been reported in patients taking riluzole.
•Pharmacokinetic variability—Due to extensive first-pass metabolism and CYP1A2 metabolism, which is heterogeneously expressed and thought to be responsible for the marked pharmacokinetic variability between individuals, riluzole has been observed to have marked pharmacokinetic variability, an attribute that manifests as a wide range of systemic drug exposure in populations administered the same dose.
•Oral numbness—Patients have reported oral numbness associated with the active pharmaceutical ingredient riluzole, which makes development of alternate formulations challenging.
The prodrug design and selected administration pathway that was pursued with troriluzole is intended to address all of these limitations of riluzole. In addition, a prodrug can be engineered to enhance absorption and protect from diminished absorption when taken with meals. The troriluzole preclinical development strategy was based on optimizing in vivo and in vitro features, such as stability in gastrointestinal and stomach fluids; stability in liver microsomes; favorable safety pharmacology with respect to off-target effects (particularly liver effects); metabolic cleavage in the plasma to release the active moiety; and enhanced gastrointestinal absorption properties. In in vivo studies in rodents, the intended benefits of this optimization program were observed, including delayed peak concentrations and greater exposure.
After six years of chemistry development and preclinical testing, the resulting lead prodrug from the chemistry program was troriluzole. Troriluzole is chemically comprised of riluzole linked via an amide bond to a tripeptide that is a substrate for gut transporters (PepT1) and which contributes to its improved bioavailability. The tripeptide moiety is cleaved by plasma aminopeptidases, releasing riluzole and naturally occurring amino acids, which we believe are readily managed by endogenous metabolic routes. We believe that the estate of compounds we acquired, combined with our internally developed intellectual property, will provide a significant protection for our innovations. Troriluzole is stable in fluids from the gastrointestinal tract and expected to have a differentiated profile with regard to any liability for hepatic effects.
SCA was chosen as the lead indication based on a strong preclinical rationale as well as demonstration of preliminary efficacy of troriluzole's active metabolite, riluzole, in two randomized controlled trials in patients with SCA and other ataxias conducted by third parties (Ristori 2010; Romano 2015). We continue to develop troriluzole for the treatment of ataxias, with an initial focus on SCA.
The Potential Benefits of Troriluzole Compared to Riluzole
We believe troriluzole offers the following potential advantages, compared to orally dosed riluzole:
•Improved Bioavailability—Troriluzole is a substrate for the gut transporters (PepT1). This is thought to increase the bioavailability of the drug as compared to orally dosed riluzole, meaning that more of the compound is absorbed by the body into the blood stream and can have an active effect. Studies have shown that administration of agents through peptide transporters significantly increases the absorption of drugs with otherwise poor oral bioavailability.
•No Negative Food Effect—Troriluzole shows no food effect in human studies, meaning that the drug will not be associated with special meal restrictions, a phenomenon potentially attributable to enhanced uptake by intestinal transporters specific to the peptide-containing moiety of troriluzole. This is in contrast to oral riluzole tablets, which require a period of fasting around dosing in order to reach therapeutic levels, currently a dose-limiting factor of riluzole.
•Lower Overall Drug Burden to the Liver—As a prodrug that mitigates first-pass liver metabolism and enhances bioavailability, therapeutic concentrations of the active metabolite riluzole can be achieved with a lower drug dose as compared to riluzole tablets. In addition, release of the active metabolite over time will result in a reduced bolus hepatic concentration as compared to that associated with riluzole tablets. Taken together, we believe these attributes of troriluzole will reduce the potential for adverse liver effects.

•Optimized Dosing Regimen and Compliance—Troriluzole has been developed as a convenient once-daily dose, which could improve regimen compliance for patients. We believe these are important features to optimize long-term health outcomes in the treatment of patients with chronic diseases.
•Potential for Developing Multiple Formulations—Troriluzole is highly soluble and does not exhibit the profound oral numbness associated with riluzole tablets. As such, we believe troriluzole has the potential to be developed in multiple formulations including intranasal, subcutaneous, intravenous, sublingual and other forms.
Overview of Ataxias and Limitations of Current Treatment
Ataxias are a group of degenerative diseases of the nervous system, including hereditary ataxias and sporadic ataxias. According to the National Ataxia Foundation, the word "ataxia" originates from a Greek word meaning "without order" or "incoordination" and aptly describes many of the symptoms that are experienced by people who suffer from the many forms of ataxia, including problems with coordination, balance and movement which can affect a person's fingers, hands, arms, legs, body, speech and eye movements. Ataxias are generally classified as being either hereditary or sporadic. Hereditary ataxias are degenerative disorders that progress over a number of years. The hereditary ataxias include autosomal dominant forms, such as SCA, episodic ataxias and dentratorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and autosomal recessive forms, such as Friedreich's ataxia, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and ataxia-telangiectasia. Sporadic ataxias are generally idiopathic, do not run in families and have an onset later in life. Sporadic ataxias share many clinical features of the hereditary forms, which is thought to be attributable to similar underlying cerebellar dysfunction.
Although symptoms may vary, the typical clinical course of SCA might be described as follows. Balance and coordination are affected first. Incoordination of hands, arms, and legs, and slurring of speech are other common, early symptoms. Over time, individuals with SCA may develop numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs (sensory neuropathy), uncontrolled muscle tensing (dystonia), muscle wasting (atrophy), and muscle twitches (fasciculations). Walking becomes difficult and is characterized by walking with feet placed further apart to compensate for poor balance. Impaired coordination of the arms and hands affects the ability to perform tasks requiring fine motor control such as writing and eating. Rarely, rigidity, tremors, and involuntary jerking movements (chorea) have been reported in people who have been affected for many years. As time goes on, ataxia can affect speech and swallowing. Finally, individuals with SCA may also have difficulty processing, learning, and remembering information (cognitive impairment). Notably, there can also be significant clinical variation in the order and extent of symptom expression between mutations, within a common mutation, and even within a kindred that shares the same genotype. Non-cerebellar involvement may also occur in many SCA subtypes (such as cognition, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, motor neuron, peripheral nerve or macular involvement). Signs and symptoms of SCA typically begin in early adulthood, but can appear anytime from childhood to late adulthood; SCA is degenerative and progresses over a number of years. The neurodegeneration is attributed to the production of abnormal proteins that cause the affected nerve cells, predominantly cerebellar purkinje fibers, to eventually function poorly and ultimately degenerate. As SCA progresses, coordination problems become more pronounced. Atrophy of the cerebellum and sometimes brainstem may be apparent on brain imaging. The diagnosis of SCA requires the exclusion of acquired, non-genetic causes of ataxia, such as alcoholism, vitamin deficiencies, multiple sclerosis, vascular disease, tumors, and paraneoplastic disease. A definitive diagnosis requires genetic testing or occurrence within a kindred that has an identified mutation. Lifespan is significantly shortened due to complications related to neurological deficits.
There are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of SCA or any other cerebellar ataxia, and treatment is supportive. In general, multidisciplinary care provides supportive measures and the goal of this treatment is to improve quality of life and survival.
Our Clinical Program for Troriluzole in Spinocerebellar Ataxia
Phase 1 Trials with Troriluzole
In July 2016, we began a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of single and multiple ascending doses of troriluzole in normal healthy volunteers. In this study, the initial safety and tolerability of troriluzole at single doses ranging from 9.5 mg to 200 mg and multiple doses ranging from 35 mg to 200 mg daily were assessed. Fifty-eight healthy volunteers have been dosed with troriluzole and 20 have been dosed with placebo. Based on preliminary data, both single and multiple doses up to 200 mg have been well tolerated without evidence of novel, clinically significant safety signals or lab abnormalities. There is no apparent dose response regarding the frequency or severity of AEs. In the blinded group, including subjects treated with both placebo and troriluzole, the most common AEs were headache (five subjects, two with moderate severity and three with mild severity) and constipation (two subjects). No pattern of AEs or lab abnormalities has become apparent to provide specific cautions or to suggest cautions beyond what is appropriate for the active metabolite, riluzole. Preliminary results suggest approximately 25% to 30% greater systemic exposure of the active metabolite via oral administration of troriluzole as compared to riluzole tablets. In addition, the time to peak

 concentration of the active metabolite via oral administration of troriluzole was extended relative to that achieved with oral riluzole tablets, thus suggesting the mitigation of first-pass metabolism. A cross-over arm of the trial assessing fed and fasted conditions suggested no food effect. These pharmacokinetic properties differentiate from direct oral administration of the active metabolite. These preliminary safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data support advancement of troriluzole. Commencing in December 2017, an additional single and multiple dose study was conducted to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of a 280 mg dose in 10 healthy young and elderly volunteers (8 active; 2 placebo). Results support adequate safety and tolerability and yielded mean exposures comparable to what would be expected from a 200 to 250 mg dose of Rilutek (based on extrapolation from Chandu 2010), a dose range that has been safely used in clinic populations and associated with efficacy in a range of disorders in randomized controlled trials (Huntington Study Group Neurology 2003; Lacomblez Neurology 1996). In addition, a bioequivalence study was conducted to bridge a commercial formulation with a Phase 2/3 formulation in 32 healthy volunteers. The commercial formulation was well-tolerated and provided bioequivalent exposure with the Phase 2/3 formulation. Exposures from these recent Phase 1 studies are consistent with an absolute bioavailability of approximately 85% or greater, based on known absolute bioavailabilty of Rilutek of 60%.
Based on the results of our Phase 1 trial with troriluzole and two third-party academic trials that have shown preliminary efficacy of riluzole in cerebellar ataxias, we advanced troriluzole into a Phase 2/3 clinical trial for SCA.
The Phase 2/3 trial has two periods: an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase followed by a 96-week open-label treatment. The study is being conducted at approximately 15 sites in the United States. The design of the trial was informed predominantly by an advisory panel of the leading ataxia experts that we hosted in February 2016 as well as the observations from peer-reviewed publications in the scientific literature. 141 subjects were randomized to receive a once-daily dose of either placebo or 140 mg troriluzole. Patients were stratified by diagnosis (genotype) and baseline severity (as measured by the patient's gait SARA score). The primary outcome measure of the trial is the change from baseline in patient SARA score after eight weeks of treatment. The choice of the SARA, a validated scale, as the primary outcome measure was based on the consensus of a panel of national experts, based largely on the validation of the instrument in multiple populations, its effective use in demonstrating efficacy in a trial with riluzole (as shown in the Romano study discussed above), favorable psychometric properties, and its ability to assess a broad spectrum of ataxia-related symptoms. A secondary outcome measure is the patient time to perform an eight-meter walk test. Exploratory outcome measures include improvement as measured using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale Part IV on functional assessment, Clinical Global Impression of Improvement and the Patient Global Impression of Change. Qualifying subjects have genotypically confirmed diagnosis of the most common SCA subtypes. They must have moderate symptom severity (i.e., SARA scores of 8 to 30 inclusive and be able to walk eight meters without assistance). Almost all subjects who completed the eight-week treatment phase elected to participate in the 96-week open-label extension phase.
We reported topline data from the 8-week randomization period from the Phase 2/3 clinical trial in SCA. At the eight week time point, troriluzole did not statistically differentiate from placebo. After eight weeks of treatment, troriluzole treated subjects demonstrated an improvement of –0.81 points [95% CI: –1.4 to –0.2] on the SARA versus –1.05 points [95% CI: –1.6 to –0.4] improvement in placebo, p-value = 0.52. Placebo response in this genetically defined disorder was higher than expected based upon prior European randomized controlled trials in SCA (Romano et al 2015; Ristori et al 2010). Post-hoc analyses suggested the potential for favorable therapeutic effects of troriluzole, based on numerically superior treatment effects compared to placebo in groups of subjects with less inherent pre-randomization variability on the primary endpoint and also in those, who based on baseline characteristics, would be expected to have greater drug exposures.
In this trial, we observed a favorable safety and tolerability profile of troriluzole, with no drug-related SAEs and low discontinuation rates due to AEs. No randomized subjects demonstrated an elevation of liver transaminases of three-fold or greater than the upper limit of normal; whereas, a similar exposure of the active metabolite, riluzole, is associated with about an 8% rate of such elevations. We believe that the reduced effects on the liver may be attributable to a higher bioavailability that in part reflects mitigated first-pass liver metabolism and enhanced PepT1-mediated absorption. Troriluzole has shown absence of a negative food effect, optimized oral bioavailability and no pattern of clinically significant effects on liver function, presenting a profile that appears distinct from what is described for riluzole in its U.S. prescribing information. This profile, in context of recent Phase 1 data assessing higher doses, will allow for exploration of higher exposures of the active metabolite than allowed by the current Rilutek label.
Post-hoc analyses of the data have led to our continued interest in developing troriluzole in SCA and is also founded on two academic randomized controlled trials studying the active metabolite or troriluzole in diverse populations with cerebellar ataxia. In these two publications, the authors conducted studies of riluzole compared to placebo to assess improvement in patients with ataxias using two different ataxia rating scales. In each study, the authors observed statistically significant improvements in the riluzole treatment groups compared to the placebo groups.

•Ristori et al 2010 demonstrated statistically significant improvement in patients with a variety of cerebellar ataxias: In a paper published in Neurology in 2010, Ristori and colleagues reported results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients presenting with cerebellar ataxias of diverse etiologies. Forty subjects were randomized to receive eight weeks of treatment with either placebo or 100 mg riluzole (50 mg riluzole tablets, dosed twice daily). The primary endpoint of the trial was the proportion of patients with a decrease of at least 5 points in the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) after four and eight weeks of treatment, compared with the baseline score. The ICARS quantifies severity of ataxia-related symptoms on a scale of zero to 100, with a higher score indicating greater impairment. The total score is the sum of four subscores which measure a patient's posture and gait (static subscore), limb coordination (kinetic subscore), speech (dysarthria subscore) and oculomotor function (ocular movement subscore). The number of patients with a five-point ICARS drop (the primary outcome measure) was significantly higher in the riluzole treatment group than in the placebo group after four weeks (9 out of 19 versus 1 out of 19; p-value = 0.003) and at eight weeks (13 out of 19 versus 1 out of 19; p-value = 0.001). The patient group treated with riluzole demonstrated superior mean changes on the ICARS scores over eight weeks of treatment as compared to the placebo group (–7.05 versus 0.16; p-value < 0.001). The table below shows the changes in ICARS from baseline in each treatment group after eight weeks of treatment, as well as the change in each subscore category. Only sporadic, mild AEs were reported in the trial. Results from this study suggest that riluzole, which is the active metabolite of troriluzole, may confer acute therapeutic effects after eight weeks of dosing in diverse forms of cerebellar ataxia.

•Romano et al 2015 demonstrated statistically significant improvement in patients with hereditary cerebellar ataxia (both SCA and Friedreich's ataxia): In an article published in The Lancet in 2015, Romano and colleagues described results of a study on the use of riluzole in patients with hereditary cerebellar ataxias over a 12-month period. In this multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, sixty subjects diagnosed with either SCA or Friedreich's ataxia (enrolled in a 2:1 ratio) were randomized to receive 12 months of treatment with either placebo or 100 mg riluzole (50 mg tablets of riluzole, twice daily). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a minimum one-point improvement on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) after 12 months. The SARA is a validated scale consisting of an eight-item, semi-quantitative performance-based assessment of cerebellar ataxia symptoms that measures impairment on a scale of zero to 40, with a higher score indicating more severe ataxia. This scale was developed to address limitations of the ICARS and has been broadly adopted over the ICARS based on superior practicability, reliability and psychometric properties. Twenty-eight patients were treated with riluzole (19 with SA and 9 with Friedreich's ataxia) and 27 patients were in the placebo group (19 with SA and 8 with Friedreich's ataxia). The proportion of patients in the riluzole treatment group with a decreased SARA score was 14 (50%) versus three (11%) in the placebo group (p-value = 0.002). No severe AEs were reported. Primary and secondary outcome measures are shown in the table below. Mean changes in the SARA scores were reported at three and 12 months of treatment, with riluzole associated with reductions in SARA ratings (1.00 and 1.02 points improvement, respectively) and placebo associated with increases (0.50 and 1.67 points, respectively) and resulting in differences between treatment groups that were statistically significant (p-values of 0.008 and 0.001, respectively). Results from this study suggest the potential efficacy of riluzole, which is the active metabolite of troriluzole, in the treatment of cerebellar ataxia.

Subsequent to our announcement of the topline results from this trial, we engaged in discussions with the FDA regarding the potential for further development of troriluzole in ataxias, and the FDA expressed willingness to consider a modification of our trial’s primary endpoint, the SARA, as an acceptable registrational endpoint. The SARA is a scale consisting of an eight-item, semi-quantitative performance-based assessment of cerebellar ataxia symptoms that measures impairment on a scale of zero to 40, with a higher score indicating more severe ataxia. Subsequent post-hoc analyses of the data from the Phase 2/3 trial has shown trends for therapeutic benefit in certain patient subgroups (for example, those who are projected to have higher drug exposures, those with certain genotypes, and those with SARA assessments with more consistent scores prior to randomization). Further, item-specific analyses of the SARA scale data suggest that certain of the eight items measured by SARA were strongly susceptible to a placebo effect. Based upon our analysis of this data, we proposed the use of a modified SARA scale in future clinical evaluation of troriluzole to the FDA. In November 2018 and February 2019, the FDA provided feedback on the use of the SARA scale and definitive guidance on the use of a modified version of the SARA scale, including a reduction in the number of domains measured and simplified scoring categories.
The following chart shows preliminary data from the long term, open-label extension phase of the Phase 2/3 trial after applying a modified SARA scale as compared to data from a natural history reference cohort, to which we applied the same modified SARA scale. A natural history study follows a group of people over time who have a specific medical condition. We utilized data from a published natural history study that enrolled 345 patients with SCA in the United States, and observed the progression of the patients’ disease using the SARA scale for up to two years.
In the chart below, interim results from the extension phase (labeled as “BHV-4157 OL”) showed sustained improvements in modified SARA scores at all four time periods (extension week 8, 16, 24 and 48) in the troriluzole treated participants, meaning that the mean change in the modified SARA scale was negative at each time point, indicating an improvement or stabilization in ataxia symptoms. In contrast, the natural history reference cohort showed an increase in the modified SARA score, indicating a worsening in ataxia symptoms, when measured at six months and one year. At one year, the mean change in the modified SARA score in the natural history reference cohort was an increase of +0.79, compared to a mean change in the troriluzole cohort of a decrease of −0.44. While the modified SARA scale that we utilized for the analysis includes the same domains as those recommended by the FDA for the planned Phase 3 clinical trial, the response categories differ from the modified SARA scale recommended by FDA, and results from the extension analyses may not be indicative of results utilizing the FDA-recommended modified SARA scale. We believe these observed changes with troriluzole treatment suggest a clinically meaningful benefit relative to the natural history reference cohort.
Longitudinal Change on Total Modified SARA Scale
Because we believe that troriluzole may offer therapeutic benefit to patients with SCA and since comparisons to historical controls are generally not accepted by the FDA as the basis for approval, we plan to initiate a second randomized, controlled trial in the first half of 2019 to further evaluate the efficacy of troriluzole in SCA. The clinical observations from our Phase 2/3 trial and open-label extension phase in SCA support our decision to advance troriluzole into an additional randomized, controlled trial that could provide the data needed to serve as the basis for an NDA. This second trial will incorporate trial design modifications based upon our post-hoc analyses of the initial Phase 2/3 trial, and will include: (1) utilization of the
Table of Contents

 modified SARA scale based on the feedback that we have received from the FDA in November 2018 and February 2019; (2) enrichment of the trial population with particular genotypes; (3) enhanced rater training procedures designed to ensure higher levels of scale reliability; (4) modified dosing regimen; and (5) extension of measurement of the primary endpoint, improvement in the patient’s modified SARA scale, to one year.
Development and Regulatory Pathway
Our clinical program for troriluzole is based on a regulatory pathway under section 505(b)(2) of the U.S. Food Drug and Cosmetic Act that allows reference to data on riluzole for the purpose of safety assessments. In addition, under current FDA interpretations, we believe troriluzole also qualifies as an NCE and thereby is eligible for conventional regulatory data exclusivities.
We are in active dialogue with the FDA to discuss the potential for further development of troriluzole in ataxias and the FDA has expressed willingness to accept a modification of our study's primary endpoint, the SARA, as an acceptable registrational endpoint. Future directions in ataxia will be based on this interaction and results from the extension phase of the ongoing study.
In the fourth quarter 2017, we completed a study demonstrating the bioequivalence of a commercial formulation of 140 mg troriluzole with the Phase 2/3 formulation that is being used in ongoing studies. An additional Phase 1 study has been conducted to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of higher doses of troriluzole (280 mg daily) in healthy young and elderly adults. We believe the preliminary results suggest an acceptable safety and tolerability profile of this dose and support its exploration in clinical populations.
Overview of Troriluzole in OCD
OCD is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms of obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors) that can interfere with patients' functional abilities. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the 12-month prevalence of OCD is 1% of the U.S. adult population, and approximately half of these cases are characterized as severe. First-line treatment for OCD includes cognitive behavior therapy, SSRIs and adjunctive use of atypical antipsychotics. Nonetheless, up to 60% of patients have an inadequate response to conventional intervention strategies. While SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics have been approved for OCD, the majority of patients do not have an adequate response to pharmacologic treatment, and some seek invasive neurosurgical procedures to ameliorate symptoms. Despite the significant public health burden, no novel mechanisms of action have been approved by the FDA for OCD in over two decades.
In multiple case studies, the use of riluzole in patients with refractory OCD has commonly been associated with meaningful improvement of symptoms. A small-scale randomized controlled trial in adults with OCD conducted by a third party showed favorable trends for the use of riluzole in outpatient settings but not in inpatient settings, a difference possibly attributed to the intensive therapeutic interactions often available in an inpatient setting. Another randomized controlled third-party study in refractory OCD failed to demonstrate the efficacy of the adjunctive use of riluzole in 60 pediatric patients with refractory OCD. A third randomized controlled third party trial demonstrated statistically significant therapeutic effects with the adjunctive use of riluzole as compared to adjunctive placebo in 50 adults with refractory OCD. These clinical effects are consistent with findings such as genetic associations of glutamate transporter genes with OCD and increased glutamate concentrations in brain and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with OCD. Taken together, we believe there is a clear rationale for advancement of troriluzole or another optimized prodrug of riluzole from our pipeline into a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in OCD.
A Phase 2/3 double-blind, randomized controlled trial on the use of troriluzole in adults with OCD commenced in late 2017 and, based on learnings from the Phase 2/3 trial in SCA, employs a higher target dose (200 mg daily) than the study in SCA. Enrollment is expected to complete in 2019. If the results are favorable, we anticipate beginning additional studies necessary to support a NDA.
Overview of Troriluzole in Alzheimer's Disease
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative dementia. It accounts for up to 80% of dementias. According to the Alzheimer's Association, in 2016 there were approximately 5.5 million people in the United States with the disease, and that number is expected to escalate rapidly in the coming years as the population ages. Observations in multiple preclinical models, suggests the active metabolite of troriluzole protects from Alzheimer's-related pathology and cognitive dysfunction. Reduced glutamate uptake transporters have been reported in postmortem brain tissue of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and the level of glutamate transporter reduction correlates with cognitive impairment as well as markers of synaptic density and neurodegeneration. Preclinical studies also suggest that age-related memory impairment in rats correlates with decreased glutamate transporter expression and this impairment has been shown to be restored by three-weeks of daily treatment with troriluzole's active drug metabolite. These findings form our rationale for pursuing a Phase 2, proof-of-concept trial of troriluzole in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, which we began in July 2018 in collaboration with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study ("ADCS").
Table of Contents

The ADCS is a leading Alzheimer's disease clinical trials research consortium that receives major support from the U.S. National Institute on Aging, a part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The ADCS was developed to promote the discovery, development, and testing of new drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The randomized controlled trial of troriluzole began in July 2018 and is expected to complete enrollment in the second half of 2019.
Overview of Troriluzole in GAD
GAD represents a disorder of significant unmet need, affecting approximately 4.3% of the population at some point in their life. Approximately one-third of cases are considered severe. GAD is a chronic condition characterized by excessive anxiety and worry that is out of proportion to actual context and causes significant distress or functional impairment. Rates of full remission have been observed to be low, with recovery rates from the index episode of less than 60% after a 12-year follow-up. In clinical studies of approved treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) the rates of remission are typically less than 50%. The social impact includes increased risk of not marrying, absenteeism, increased risk of suicide, and high healthcare costs. Minimal research has been conducted on the treatment of GAD that has not responded to conventional therapy. Frequently treatment-resistant patients are adjunctively administered benzodiazepines despite the potential for abuse and consequently symptom exacerbation. Based on the unmet medical need described above, additional treatments are required for populations with GAD that has not responded adequately to pharmacotherapy.
Our rationale for advancing troriluzole into a Phase 2 trial in GAD is based on treatment effect in preclinical models of anxiety as well as favorable open-label case studies of patients treated with riluzole and a recent randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial with BHV-0223 in a clinical model of anxiety disorder. In one case study of riluzole in GAD, eight of 15 patients demonstrated a remission with a median response time of 2.5 weeks after starting riluzole 50 mg twice daily.
Overview of Troriluzole in Other Indications
Given the novel chemical properties of troriluzole and its unique mechanism of action, we believe troriluzole, or another optimized prodrug of riluzole, has the potential for broad applicability across several neurological indications where modulation of brain glutamate has been implicated in underlying disease states. A brief description of potential indications that we could pursue in the future with troriluzole or other optimized prodrugs from our pipeline is summarized below. We will determine the timing and prioritization of additional indications as warranted by emerging data.
Other Orphan Indications
If data from the ongoing extension phase of the SCA trial support the role of troriluzole in the treatment of SCA, then we will explore the role troriluzole in the treatment of other ataxias. Of note, preliminary data is also provided by the Ristori and Romano randomized controlled trials, which showed improvement in some patients with Friedreich's ataxia, multisystem atrophy of the cerebellar type, sporadic ataxia, antibody-associated ataxia and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. We expect that the next wave of ataxia indications we would pursue, if warranted by data from the SCA trial, would include Friedreich's ataxia and sporadic ataxia.
•Friedreich's Ataxia:  Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with progressive cerebellar degeneration with worsening ataxia, areflexia, which is the absence of reflexes, sensory loss, weakness, glucose dysregulation, and cardiomyopathy—often with onset in early childhood. According to the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance, an estimated 6,400 individuals in the United States have Friedreich's ataxia. Treatment is supportive and no pharmacotherapies are approved by the FDA for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia.
•Sporadic Ataxia:  Sporadic ataxia, also called idiopathic ataxia, shares symptoms of SCA but is associated with an unknown cause, typically presenting after the age of 40 years and commonly associated with cerebellar degeneration. Sporadic ataxia comprises the majority of patients treated in specialty ataxia clinics. These patients typically have progressive balance difficulties with other features of cerebellar disease such as dysarthria (speech problems), dysphagia (swallowing difficulty), as well as visual symptoms such as double vision. According to Orphanet, the prevalence of sporadic ataxia is between 1 and 9 per 100,000 persons, suggesting that there are between 3,200 and 28,000 individuals with sporadic ataxia in the United States.
Other (Non-Orphan) Cerebellar Disorders
Table of Contents

•Essential Tremor:  Like SCA, the pathophysiology of essential tremor ("ET") reflects underlying cerebellar dysfunction. ET is the most common type of tremor, characterized by action and postural tremor in the upper extremities and/or head and voice tremor. The prevalence of ET is approximately four times that of the second most common tremor disorder, Parkinson's disease. ET can be highly disabling, as many ET patients cannot write, type, drink, or feed themselves due to tremor. ET is a progressive disease and with time, the tremor becomes more severe and disabling. Currently, only two medications, primidone and propranolol, are commonly employed as first-line symptomatic treatment of ET, but these are ineffective in 40% of ET patients and none of the available medications are FDA-approved for ET. Therefore, a novel symptomatic therapy for ET could serve an important unmet medical need for a substantial population. Preclinical studies with troriluzole in mouse genetic and toxicity models of ataxia have shown reductions in tremor. Supported by this data, we are developing a Phase 2 study of troriluzole in subjects with ET in collaboration with the Tremor Research Group, a national, independent, non-profit organization of scientific investigators.
Broader Neuropsychiatric Indications
Based upon preclinical and preliminary clinical work, we also believe there are several potential expansions for troriluzole, or another optimized prodrug of riluzole from our pipeline, including potential for therapeutic application in a broad range of neuropsychiatric conditions, such as anxiety disorders, mood disorders and neurodegenerative disorders.
Anxiety Disorders
•Social Anxiety Disorder:  Social anxiety disorder ("SAD"), is a marked and persistent fear of social situations, causing impairment and distress, which can impair school, work and social functioning. SAD affects approximately 12% of Americans. Roughly one-third to one-half of patients with SAD do not experience significant clinical benefit from current treatments, including SSRIs. Several uncontrolled trials have suggested the efficacy of glutamate modulating agents for reducing anxiety symptoms in adults with other anxiety disorders, such as GAD and OCD, as well as major depression. We are collaborating with researchers at Yale University ("Yale") to explore the use of our glutamate modulating agents in the treatment of SAD.
Mood Disorders
•Bipolar Depression:  Bipolar disorder is a chronic disorder associated with periods of depressive or manic moods that often severely affect overall functioning. The limited available treatment options include conventional antidepressants, but they are associated with increased cycling between manic and depressed phases. Approved agents for bipolar depression (atypical antipsychotics) are associated with weight gain, sedation and safety issues. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, bipolar disorder affects approximately 5.7 million Americans, or about 2.6% of the U.S. population, every year. As many as one in five patients with bipolar disorder commits suicide. The rationale for assessing troriluzole in treating bipolar depression derives from multiple third-party publications on the use of riluzole. In one study of 14 patients with bipolar depression, improvement was observed after treatment with riluzole (and within a subset of four patients that were resistant to lamotrigine, three remitted or partially responded). Another third-party study observed positive effects in 14 largely treatment-resistant patients after six weeks of treatment with 100-200 mg per day of riluzole. In this study, early changes observed on magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which measures patients' brain glutamate levels, correlated with clinical improvement.
Other Indications Being Pursued by our Collaborators
Our collaborators are exploring the potential applicability of troriluzole beyond cerebellar and neuropsychiatric indications, including in melanoma (Rutgers University) and glioblastoma (Johns Hopkins University). The oncology collaborations with Rutgers and Johns Hopkins are based upon the mechanistic rationale that some tumors overexpress glutamate receptors, the central role that glutamate may have in cancer metabolism and the effect of glutamate on the tumor microenvironment. Troriluzole is currently being assessed in a Phase 1 study (NCT03229278) to evaluate the safety in combination with nivolumab and pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic or unresectable cancer (including melanoma). The study is being conducted at Rutgers University.
Our Product Candidate BHV-0223 for ALS
Overview of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Limitations of Current Treatments
ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative motor neuron disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. The disease belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases, which are characterized by the gradual degeneration and death of motor neurons. ALS affects up to 20,000 individuals in the United States and typically presents in patients with painless muscle weakness, trouble swallowing and muscle atrophy that ultimately progresses to paralysis, impaired breathing and death.
Since the FDA's approval of riluzole in 1995, only two agents have been approved by the FDA in ALS drug therapeutics and riluzole is the only agent indicated to enhance survival and/or time to tracheostomy. Several therapies are currently in clinical trials. Riluzole itself has pharmacokinetic and pharmaceutic limitations that have restricted its broader clinical application. Riluzole tablets have 60% bioavailability, attributed to high first-pass metabolism in the liver that is thought to be mediated via metabolism by the heterogeneously expressed CYP1A2 enzyme. This metabolic route is also thought to contribute

 to the high pharmacokinetic variability associated with riluzole. In addition, riluzole is associated with reduced exposure when taken with meals, or a negative food effect, resulting in the guidance to take riluzole within a period of fasting (one hour before or two hours after a meal) for each of two daily doses. In addition, riluzole has dose-dependent effects on liver function tests that necessitate periodic liver function test monitoring and is associated with transient liver transaminase elevations. At riluzole daily doses of 100 mg, drug discontinuation is required in 2% to 4% of subjects. However, this has not been observed with lower doses, an important observation as the planned commercial dose of BHV-0223 represents a lower drug load than the FDA-approved dose of riluzole while delivering similar exposures. The drug substance of riluzole itself has other intrinsic limitations that complicate the ability to produce non-tablet formulations, including very low solubility in water, poor oral palatability, pH dependent chemical stability and intense oral numbness if administered directly to the oral mucosa.
Our Clinical Program for BHV-0223 in ALS
BHV-0223 is a formulation of riluzole designed to advance beyond the limitations of riluzole tablets for application in ALS. BHV-0223 is a sublingual ODT of riluzole, that makes use of proprietary Zydis ODT technology that we have licensed from Catalent for use with riluzole. Catalent's ODT technology allows us to develop a form of riluzole that is fast-dissolving and which we expect will mitigate many of the shortcomings associated with the solid oral dosage form of riluzole. Based on over 20 years of global clinical experience with riluzole, we expect that BHV-0223 is likely to be well tolerated in chronic dosing. To date, we have conducted two Phase 1 trials of BHV-0223 in healthy volunteers.
We believe BHV-0223 offers the following potential advantages, compared to the solid oral dosage form of riluzole, in the treatment of ALS:
•Ease of Administration—An early symptom in many patients with ALS is difficulty swallowing, which makes it especially challenging for ALS patients to swallow traditional riluzole tablets. In contrast, using our licensed ODT technology, ALS patients will benefit from a fast-dissolving tablet that does not require swallowing or administration of liquids.
•More Predictable Pharmacokinetic Performance—Because some ALS patients experience difficulty swallowing, they often crush their solid riluzole tablets and take with food in order to ease administration, which, in addition to resulting in mucosal numbness, leads to uncertain pharmacokinetic performance as riluzole is supposed to be administered on an empty stomach. With BHV-0223, ALS patients will not have to crush or alter the form of administration, leading to more predictable pharmacokinetic performance. In our Phase 1 trials, we have observed that BHV-0223 is associated with less pharmacokinetic variability than 50 mg riluzole.
•Lack of Food Effect on Overall Exposure (as assessed by AUC)—Prescribing instructions for riluzole tablets state that it should be taken at least an hour before, or two hours after, a meal to avoid food-related decreases in bioavailability. Patients who do not strictly adhere to these fasting requirements or administer crushed riluzole in food may not be obtaining desired therapeutic levels of riluzole. BHV-0223 was designed to readily be absorbed sublingually and directly enter the blood stream without passing through the intestines. Since absorption of BHV-0223 occurs through the vasculature under the tongue, we do not anticipate fasting requirements. We believe this attribute will be particularly beneficial for late-stage ALS patients who require a continuous feeding tube for nutrition. Topline results from a food effect assessment with a Phase 1 study, demonstrated bioequivalent exposure (i.e., overall exposures as measured by AUC) for BHV-0223 40 mg when administered under fed or fasted states. Cmax concentrations under fed and fasted conditions differed, as is commonly observed with sublingual formulations; however, it is generally thought that efficacy of riluzole is driven by overall extent of exposure (AUC).
•Reduced Drug Load and Liver Exposure—Riluzole is associated with dose-dependent liver function increases attributable to high dose loads and extensive liver metabolism. Since BHV-0223 is sublingually absorbed, first-pass liver metabolism is mitigated and lower doses of riluzole are needed to be administered, thereby reducing potential risk for hepatic enzyme elevations.
BHV-0223 has been dosed in approximately 150 healthy subjects in Phase 1 studies and in patients with ALS for the assessment of pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability. AEs have generally been mild and transient; no treatment-related SAEs have been observed. In January 2018, we announced topline results of a bioequivalence study. Topline results confirmed that sublingual BHV-0223 (40 mg) achieves bioequivalent exposures relative to Rilutek (50 mg). In the study, 138 healthy volunteers were administered BHV-0223 and Rilutek under fasted conditions. In the pre-specified primary analysis, BHV-0223 achieved area-under-the-curve and peak exposures of approximately 90% and 113%, respectively, compared to those generated by generic riluzole. The 90% confidence intervals were within the 80% to 125% range that is used to define bioequivalence. In this study, 67 of these 138 subjects were also assessed after being administered BHV-0223 (40mg) under fed conditions. Topline results from a food effect assessment with a Phase 1 study, demonstrated bioequivalent AUC exposures for BHV-0223
Table of Contents

 40 mg when administered under fed or fasted states. Cmax concentrations under fed and fasted conditions differed, as is commonly observed with sublingual formulations; however, it is generally thought that efficacy of riluzole is driven by overall extent of exposure (AUC). In addition, we completed dosing in three other studies: assessing tolerability of a single dose in dysphagic patients with ALS; assessing the tolerability of BHV-0223 with two-month dosing in ALS patients; and, assessing swallowing mechanics via videofluorscopic imaging in healthy volunteers after a single dose of BHV-0223. Results from these studies show that BHV-0223 is generally well tolerated and can be safely administered to patients with ALS and healthy volunteers, without evidence for novel adverse events that have not already been associated with Rilutek tablets. BHV-0223 is associated with higher rates of oral numbness (transient and generally mild) than Rilutek tablets, as expected due to the route of administration.
Development and Regulatory Pathway
In December 2016, the FDA granted orphan drug designation of BHV-0223 for the treatment of ALS, with eligibility for orphan exclusivity contingent on a showing that BHV-0223 is clinically superior to Rilutek, a previously approved form of riluzole, as well as any other versions of riluzole that may be approved for the same indication before BHV-0223 is approved. Clinical superiority may be demonstrated by showing that a drug has greater effectiveness than the approved drug, greater safety in a substantial portion of the target population, or otherwise makes a major contribution to patient care.
After a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in the first quarter of 2018, we submitted a NDA to the FDA to pursue the regulatory approval of BHV-0223 for ALS under Section 505(b)(2) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in September 2018. The PDUFA date is in July 2019. 
Glutamate NMDA Receptor Antagonism
An NMDA receptor antagonist is a type of glutamate antagonist that works to inhibit the action of NMDA receptors which may play a role in degenerative diseases that affect the brain. BHV-5000 is an oral prodrug of the intravenous drug lanicemine, also referred to as BHV-5500, both of which we in-licensed from AstraZeneca AB ("AstraZeneca"). In addition to being orally available, BHV-5000 is a first-in-class, low-trapping, NMDA receptor antagonist with differentiating pharmacologic properties from other agents in development targeting this receptor. The unique property of low-trapping antagonists is their ability to uncouple from the NMDA receptor more freely than other agents, a property that is thought to contribute to their mitigated risk of dissociative effects as has been observed in the clinic. Lanicemine, the active metabolite of BHV-5000, binds within the NMDA channel pore and functionally blocks the flow of charged ions through the NMDA receptor complex. Lanicemine was initially advanced by AstraZeneca into clinical trials for the potential treatment of stroke, but this development was discontinued as initial results did not warrant continued development for this indication. We are developing BHV-5000 as a potential best-in-class NMDA receptor antagonist for treatment of neuropsychiatric indications.
Our Product Candidate BHV-5000 for Neuropsychiatric indications, such as Rett Syndrome
Overview of Rett Syndrome and Limitations of Current Treatments
Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from an X-linked dominant gene mutation (MECP2). As a result, it occurs almost exclusively in females. After six to 18 months of apparently normal development, patients with Rett syndrome show global deceleration of psychomotor development and subsequent loss of acquired cognitive and motor skills, such as the loss of speech. Patients may also develop pathognomonic stereotyped hand movement or display autonomic dysfunction such as breathing irregularities, including brain-mediated episodes of transient respiratory suppression, or apneic periods. With intensive care, patients may survive into adulthood, yet they are severely physically and cognitively impaired. Rett syndrome occurs in all racial and ethnic groups and occurs worldwide in approximately 1 in every 10,000 live female births. There are approximately 15,000 females with Rett syndrome in the United States. No approved treatments for Rett syndrome are currently available and care is supportive.
Our Clinical Program for BHV-5000 in Rett Syndrome
BHV-5000 and lanicemine have been observed to ameliorate the phenotype in transgenic mouse models of Rett syndrome, models which recapitulate key clinical features, such as irregular breathing, apneic periods, abnormal EEG with altered seizure threshold. Based on the preclinical experience, we have chosen to advance BHV-5000 into clinical trials for the treatment of breathing irregularities associated with Rett syndrome. The orally bioavailable prodrug BHV-5000, which was developed as an advancement on the intravenously administered lanicemine, offers an improved route of administration over lanicemine, and has thus been positioned as the lead candidate in this series. After ingestion, BHV-5000 is rapidly cleaved by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), yielding the active metabolite lanicemine. AstraZeneca studied BHV-5000 in a Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose trial. Doses up to 95 mg of BHV-5000 were studied and were observed to be well tolerated without any clinically relevant safety issues. Among the AEs reported were three cases of euphoria, three cases of hallucination, or visual distortion, and eight cases of nystagmus, a visual condition. These AEs are consistent with NMDA
Table of Contents

 receptor antagonism. After oral ingestion, systemic concentrations of BHV-5000 were observed to be very low, typically below the limit of quantification.
Preclinical Studies and Previous Clinical Trials with Lanicemine and BHV-5000
As noted above, BHV-5000 and lanicemine have been observed to ameliorate the phenotype in transgenic mouse models of Rett syndrome. In particular, BHV-5000 has been observed to reduce the number of apneic episodes that are driven by dysfunctions in the central nervous system. These preclinical findings are consistent with those reported for the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, and have been observed at concentrations that have been well tolerated by healthy volunteers in clinical trials. The potential relevance of the preclinical models with this mechanism of action are supported by anecdotal reports on the incidental use of ketamine in patients with Rett syndrome that have been associated with clinical improvements.
The figure below shows results from a preclinical study with BHV-5000 in a transgenic mouse model. Transgenic (heterozygous for MECP2 mutation) and wild-type mice were administered a single dose of saline or BHV-5000 followed by measurement of apneic episodes. Acute administration of BHV-5000 was associated with a marked reduction in the number of apneic episodes.
Lanicemine has been administered to approximately 770 subjects in single or multiple doses in 18 clinical trials conducted by AstraZeneca and has been observed to be generally well tolerated. In clinical experience with lanicemine, the most common adverse event was dizziness. CNS-type AEs from Phase 1 trials also included headache, somnolence, asthenia, impaired concentration and dysesthesias. In one study, formal assessment of cognitive function in healthy volunteers revealed improvement in some components of memory, decreased vigilance and decreased calmness. Hypotension and hypertension have been reported as AEs, with low mean increases in blood pressure reported in some studies (e.g., 4 - 8 mmHg supine systolic blood pressure; 2 - 4 mmHg supine diastolic blood pressure—which occurred at doses higher than considered necessary for therapeutic effects). AEs related to dissociation were infrequent but more common in the lanicemine group compared to placebo. AEs potentially associated with abuse potential were low but more common in the lanicemine group than the placebo group. No pattern of clinically meaningful differences between lanicemine and placebo were noted on physical exam, clinical laboratory test results or ECG results.
Approximately 40 healthy volunteers have been dosed with single or multiple doses of BHV-5000 in clinical trials conducted by AstraZeneca, and it was observed to be well tolerated without any clinically relevant safety issues. We believe BHV-5000 has no pharmacologic activity of its own and is rapidly metabolized to lanicemine in humans. After oral ingestion, systemic concentrations of BHV-5000 are very low, typically below the limit of quantification.
Nonclinical Toxicology Experience with Lanicemine and BHV-5000
In nonclinical studies, the major dose limiting effects in both rats and dogs were central nervous system effects, which appeared rapidly and included ataxia, head weaving, depressed activity, and, at very high doses, convulsions. At pharmacologically effective doses, lanicemine did not elicit adverse effects on learning, memory or attention. Small increases in heart rate and blood pressure at very high doses were observed. In the rat with daily dosing, effects on adrenal gland, heart tissue, thyroid and kidney were apparent at very high doses—more than 10-fold the proposed maximum clinical exposure. These effects were not seen in dogs and intermittent dosing in the rat was not associated with effects on the kidney or heart. At very high doses, evidence of neuron degeneration was apparent in very few neurons, a finding that is associated with glutamate antagonists. Based on these preclinical findings, which were consistent with other NMDA receptor antagonists, such as
Table of Contents

 ketamine, lanicemine was advanced into clinical trials. Toxicology studies with BHV-5000, up to 2 weeks in rats and dogs, revealed findings consistent with lanicemine, which was expected given the negligible concentrations of BHV-5000 as compared to the active metabolite, lanicemine. A GLP neurotoxicology study is ongoing, as required for this class of agent, in order to confirm maximum acceptable therapeutic exposures in clinic populations.
Clinical Development of BHV-5000
In July 2017, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for BHV-5000 for the treatment of patients with Rett syndrome. Our clinical program for BHV-5000 will build upon AstraZeneca's previous development efforts for lanicemine. In support, BHV-5000 is rapidly metabolized to lanicemine and, in a Phase 1 trial, concentrations of BHV-5000 were detectable in only a few subjects who received the highest dose. As a result, we intend to rely on long-term Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP") toxicology, reproductive toxicology and carcinogenicity studies of lanicemine to potentially expedite the safety package for BHV-5000.
A lead formulation has been selected for advancing into a Phase 1 clinical trial of BHV-5000, to bridge PK with a prior formulation. Enrollment in this study commenced in the fourth quarter of 2017, with the first patient dosed in January 2018. All 10 subjects have been enrolled in a combined single and multiple dose trial (8 active; 2 placebo) and completed study participation. BHV-5000 was observed to be well tolerated with no clinically relevant safety signals. These results are consistent with prior experience. That is, prior formulations of BHV-5000 had been dosed in approximately 40 healthy subjects in a Phase 1 trial conducted by AstraZeneca, and was observed to be well tolerated with no clinically relevant safety signals. Its active metabolite, lanicemine, has been administered intravenously in clinical trials conducted by AstraZeneca to approximately 770 subjects, in single or multiple doses, and has been observed to be generally well tolerated with most AEs being mild and transient in nature.
Currently, we are conducting neurotoxicology studies that are required for NMDA antagonist drugs to define acceptable clinical exposures. Based on these results, an additional Phase 1 study may be required to establish the dose that would subsequently be used in a randomized controlled trial of BHV-5000. One of our planned indications for BHV-5000 is Rett syndrome, based on the ability of BHV-5000 and its active metabolite to favorably impact breathing abnormalities and global brain biochemical abnormalities in transgenic mouse models. The Phase 2/3 trial is being developed in collaboration with experts in the field.  Potential other conditions include depression, neuropathic pain and other disorders involving NMDA receptor dysfunction.
Major Depressive Disorder
Major depressive disorder ("MDD") is the leading cause of disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. In the United States, the prevalence rate is approximately 7%. Despite the approval of over two dozen agents, therapeutic effects are limited. More than one-third of patients who complete an initial course of antidepressant treatment will not achieve a satisfactory response, and as many as 20% of patients have chronic depression despite multiple interventions. The only class of agents approved for this population of inadequate responders (also deemed treatment resistant depression) is atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g., aripiprazole, quetiapine, olanzapine-fluoxetine combination and brexpiprazole), agents associated with significant short-term and long-term side effect burdens (sedation, metabolic syndrome, obesity, extrapyramidal side effects that can include akathisia and elevated risk of tardive dyskinesia). Other agents in clinical stages of development for major depressive disorder include rapastinel (Allergan, in Phase 2 testing), esketamine (Johnson & Johnson, in Phase 3 testing), and ALKS-5461 (a combined formulation of buprenorphine and samidorphin developed by Alkermes, which has reported positive Phase 3 data).
Clinical findings of antidepressant effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine have provided a link between the NMDA receptor function and depression and a rationale for testing BHV-5000 as an antidepressant. In nonclinical studies, BHV-5000's active metabolite is active in models of depression and anxiety. These data prompted a line of investigation with lanicemine that included four randomized controlled trials conducted by AstraZeneca in patients with treatment resistant depression, overall suggesting an adequate safety and tolerability profile and potential for therapeutic benefit. However, the clinical data to date has not established clear efficacy and additional trials are needed.
Neuropathic Pain
Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition caused by dysfunctional or damaged nerves. Neuropathic pain can be a debilitating and common problem affecting approximately 10% of adults in the United States. Despite the availability of multiple approved drugs, including Lyrica, and guidelines for the treatment of neuropathic pain, treatment of this condition remains a major therapeutic challenge. Existing analgesics are often ineffective, can cause serious side effects and have abuse potential that limits widespread use. Increased NMDA receptor activity is known to contribute to central sensitization in neuropathic pain. NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to reduce hyperalgesia and pain in animal models of neuropathic pain induced by nerve injury and diabetic neuropathy. Clinically used NMDA receptor antagonists, including
Table of Contents

 ketamine and dextromethorphan, can be effective in patients suffering from neuropathic pain syndromes. The clinical use of robust NMDA antagonists, such as ketamine, is limited due to dissociative, psychotomimetic and abuse potential properties. Novel NMDA receptor antagonists, such as BHV-5000, that are not associated with the psychotomimetic effects and abuse potential could lead to better management of neuropathic pain without causing serious side effects.
Our Other Platforms
Our Product Candidate Verdiperstat for Multiple System Atrophy
Verdiperstat is a first-in-class, potent, selective, brain-permeable, irreversible myeloperoxidase ("MPO") enzyme inhibitor that we are developing for the treatment of multiple system atrophy ("MSA"). Myeloperoxidase generates an array of cytotoxic oxidants and is a key driver of oxidative and inflammatory processes that underlie a broad range of disorders. MPO is plays a key role in neurodegenerative, inflammatory, and immune-mediated diseases, including MSA, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, ischemic and hemorrhagic forms of stroke, epilepsy, depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Clinical and experimental studies have revealed the detrimental role of MPO. Hence, suppressing MPO may be a novel treatment approach for these disorders.
Verdiperstat was in-licensed from AstraZeneca (formerly named AZD3241) in September 2018. Seven clinical studies have been completed (all by AstraZeneca), including four Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects, two Phase 2a studies in subjects with Parkinson’s disease, and one Phase 2b study in subjects with MSA. In February 2019, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of MSA. Verdiperstat has also received orphan drug designation for the treatment of MSA from the European Commission upon recommendation from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products.
Overview of Multiple System Atrophy and Limitations of Current Treatments
Multiple System Atrophy
MSA is an orphan disease that is an adult-onset, fatal, neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive autonomic failure, parkinsonian features, and cerebellar and pyramidal features in various combinations and degrees of severity. It invariably leads to death after an average of 6 to 10 years from symptom onset. No disease-modifying treatment currently exists; only symptomatic and palliative approaches are available.
Multiple system atrophy patients are divided into 2 groups, those with parkinsonian features as the predominant symptoms ("MSA-P") and those for whom cerebellar ataxia is the predominant symptom ("MSA-C"). Approximately 60-80% of MSA patients in Europe and North America have the MSA-P subtype, whereas 65-85% of MSA patients in Japan and Korea have the MSA-C subtype. According to the consensus statement by the American Autonomic Society and American Academy of Neurology in 2007, the diagnosis of MSA includes 3 categories: definite, probable, and possible MSA. Definite MSA requires the neuropathological findings of widespread and abundant CNS α-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic inclusions in association with neurodegenerative changes in striatonigral or olivopontocerebellar structures. Probable and possible MSA diagnoses are based on clinical symptoms and neurologic examination findings. The diagnosis of MSA can be aided by laboratory investigations, structural and functional imaging, and a variety of other diagnostic tools. The defining molecular and cellular neuropathology of MSA is the widespread presence of glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) containing fibrilized α-synuclein protein in oligodendrocytes. Thus, MSA is thus considered an α-synucleinopathy, similar to Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, but with distinct pathological and clinical features. The defining neuropathology of MSA upon postmortem examination includes variable degrees of olivopontocerebellar atrophy and striatonigral degeneration, reflecting the ataxia and parkinsonism, respectively, that are present during life. Neurodegenerative changes affecting the central autonomic nervous system are also evident, and include the hypothalamus, noradrenergic and serotonergic brainstem nuclei, dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve, nucleus ambiguus, intermediolateral columns of the spinal cord, and Onuf’s nucleus. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MSA remain unclear, evidence from preclinical models and postmortem studies in humans suggest that formation of GCIs is associated with oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, loss of neurotrophic support, and ultimately, neuronal cell death.
Current Treatments
There are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of disease progression in MSA. Existing medical management is focused exclusively on attempting to reduce symptoms by using drugs approved for various other indications along with dietary supplements. Use of these agents in MSA, however, is not supported by high-quality evidence from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, and it is widely accepted that none of these drugs is particularly effective in alleviating MSA symptoms.
Table of Contents

The dopaminergic agent, levodopa, which is used in Parkinson’s disease, is commonly used in MSA at high doses and may reduce motor symptoms, including rigidity and bradykinesia, in a subset of patients. Amantadine is used in MSA and is purported to provide some benefits. Botulinum toxin is used in MSA and may temporarily reduce movement disorder symptoms, such as dystonias. The mitochondrial micronutrient coenzyme Q10 is also used in MSA because of its antioxidant properties. Additional nonspecific measures may be used in MSA to manage autonomic symptoms, sleep disorders, depression, and other clinical manifestations. Non-pharmacological supportive/palliative measures are commonly used in MSA. In terms of motor symptoms, physical and occupational therapy, employment of assistive devices, and speech and language therapy may be used. In terms of autonomic symptoms, intermittent or permanent urethral or suprapubic catheterization may be used for urinary symptoms and elastic stockings and adequate salt and fluid intake may be used for orthostatic hypotension.
The treatment strategies noted above focus on alleviating and managing symptoms rather than modifying the course of MSA. Specifically, there are no medications that can stop, or even slow down, the relentless progression of MSA. In contrast, verdiperstat offers a novel mechanistic approach of reducing MPO activity, which is believed to be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. This reduction of MPO activity may result in slowing down the progression of MSA.
Nonclinical Studies and Previous Clinical Trials
Non-clinical 
The nonclinical pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of verdiperstat have been extensively characterized.
Verdiperstat effectively inhibits MPO in vivo and is efficacious in two different MSA models suggesting disease modification potential in MSA. The effect on motor performance, as well as the neuroprotective effect of verdiperstat, was evaluated in a mouse model of early MSA. Mice received vehicle or verdiperstat via oral gavage for 28 days. Significant neuroprotection (Figure X) was demonstrated by verdiperstat, with preservation of neurons at the level of substantia nigra pars compacta, striatum, cerebellar cortex, pontine nuclei, and inferior olivary complex, as well as functional recovery (Figure Y) measured by 4 different behavioral tests (motor score, stride length test, open field activity, rearing). The verdiperstat effect was related to suppression of microglial activation without detectable changes in astrogliosis.
Effects on neuroprotection and microglial activation of treatment with verdiperstat after disease onset were evaluated in a mouse model of advanced MSA. Treatment with verdiperstat was initiated after disease onset and continued for 19-20 days. No improvements in behavioral tests or neuroprotection occurred, but a marked reduction in microglial activation in the brain (SNc, pontine nuclei, inferior olives, corpus callosum) was observed.
A comprehensive toxicology data package has been developed on verdiperstat including single dose toxicity, repeat-dose toxicity (including chronic toxicity in rats and dogs), genetic toxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, and special toxicity.
Previous Clinical Trials
Seven clinical studies have been completed, all sponsored by AstraZeneca. These studies include one Phase 2b study in subjects with MSA, two Phase 2a studies in subjects with Parkinson’s Disease, and four Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers, that inform PK, metabolic interactions, safety, tolerability and efficacy. A total of 234 subjects have received verdiperstat to date. A total of 167 subjects in Phase 1 and 2 studies have received multiple doses of verdiperstat (D0490C00002, D0490C00003, D0490C00004, D0490C00005, and D0490C00023), ranging from 50 to 600 mg BID for up to 12 weeks and 900 mg BID for 2.5 days. A total of 67 subjects have received single doses of verdiperstat in Phase 1 studies (Studies D0490C00001 and D0490C00012), ranging from 1 to 50 mg. Overall, the PK and safety profile from the Phase 1 studies provided support for the investigation of verdiperstat at doses up to 600 mg BID in Phase 2 studies.
In a Phase 2b study, subjects with MSA were randomized to receive verdiperstat 300 mg BID, verdiperstat 600 mg BID, or placebo for 12 weeks; efficacy assessments were exploratory. The verdiperstat groups exhibited numerical, but not statistically significant, improvements compared to the placebo group that were dose-related, based on changes in the Unified MSA Rating Scale scores from baseline to Week 12. Placebo-treated subjects worsened by 4.6 points, while BHV‑3241 treated subjects showed less worsening of 3.7 points at the 300-mg dose and 2.6 points at the 600-mg dose, suggesting a dose-response relationship. Changes on positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [11C]-PBR28 binding to translocator protein (TSPO), a marker for microglial activation, did not demonstrate statistically different changes between groups. Verdiperstat treatment for 12 weeks (at doses of 300 mg BID and 600 mg BID) showed statistically significant reductions in certain measures of MPO specific activity in plasma. These results support the intended mechanism of action of verdiperstat. Verdiperstat treatment was generally safe and well-tolerated in MSA subjects at doses of 300 mg and 600 mg BID.
Table of Contents

Data from two Phase 2a studies in subjects with Parkinson’s disease showed reductions in MPO activity for subjects treated with verdiperstat 600 mg BID compared with placebo-treated subjects, offering further support for the mechanism of action of verdiperstat (i.e., reduced microglial activation). The 300-mg BID dose was safe and well tolerated, and the 600-mg BID dose was generally safe and well tolerated in most subjects.
Our Clinical Program for Verdiperstat for Multiple System Atrophy
In January 2019, we received a may-proceed letter from the FDA regarding the continued development of verdiperstat in a Phase 3 randomized controlled trial in patients with MSA. The planned study design is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group study. The estimated sample size is approximately 252 patients. The anticipated dose of verdiperstat (based on the Ph2 study) is 600 mg twice daily. The primary outcome measure is expected to be the Unified MSA Rating Scale. We are expecting to start enrollment in the trial in the third quarter of 2019.

In October 2018, we signed an exclusive, worldwide option and license agreement with the University of Connecticut for the development and commercialization rights to UC1MT, a therapeutic antibody targeting extracellular metallothionein (MT). Extracellular MT has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Under this agreement, we have the option to acquire an exclusive, worldwide license to UC1MT and its underlying patents to develop and commercialize throughout the world in all human indications.
Kleo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
From August 2016 through November 2018, we made several investments to acquire a minority equity interest in Kleo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Kleo") a privately held, development-stage company founded by a professor of chemistry and pharmacology at Yale University that is developing small molecule immunotherapies that emulate biologics to fight cancers and infectious diseases. We have also entered into a consulting agreement with Kleo to assist Kleo with clinical development. To date, no services have been provided under this agreement.
On August 29, 2016, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Kleo to purchase 3,000,000 shares of Kleo's common stock at an initial closing, with a commitment to purchase an aggregate of 5,500,000 additional shares of common stock, in each case at a share price of $1.00 per share. We purchased 3,000,000 shares upon the initial closing on August 31, 2016, and the remaining 5,500,000 shares were purchased in four equal tranches of 1,375,000 shares, which we completed in March, June and October 2017, and January 2018. In connection with the initial investment, we received the right to designate two members of Kleo's board of directors.
In March 2017, we purchased 500,000 shares of Kleo common stock directly from a co-founder of Kleo for consideration of $249,750 in cash and 32,500 shares of our common shares.
In addition to these purchases, in October 2017, we purchased an additional aggregate of 2,049,543 shares for cash consideration of $2.3 million and in November 2018 we participated in Kleo's Series B funding raise where we purchased 1,420,818 common shares for cash consideration of $5.0 million. As of the close of the Series B funding raise, and December 31, 2018, our ownership interest in the outstanding stock of Kleo was 41.9%. The Company assigned its shares and the rights under the related agreements to Biohaven Therapeutics Ltd. its wholly owned subsidiary on November 12, 2018.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their safety, efficacy, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Many of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through

 collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
CGRP Receptor Antagonist Platform
With regard to rimegepant and BHV-3500, our compounds target acute treatment of migraine and migraine prevention. We face competition from companies that develop and/or sell the following types of migraine treatments:
Triptans (Acute Treatment of Migraine)
Clinicians use a number of pharmacologic agents for the acute treatment and/or prevention of migraine. Initial management is often with over-the-counter products (e.g. Excedrin, ibuprofen) or some prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (e.g. diclofenac). The dominant class of prescription medication for the acute treatment of migraine are serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists, or triptans. There are seven different triptans (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan), the first of which was developed and approved over 25 years ago and, today, all triptans are generic. The initial introduction of triptans represented a shift toward drugs more selectively targeting the suspected pathophysiology of migraine. A 5-HT1F receptor antagonist, lasmiditan, could be approved as early as 2019. Lasmiditan was developed by CoLucid and acquired by Eli Lilly in January 2017. Lasmiditan could be the first new class of agent approved for the acute treatment of migraine since the triptans and, if approved, would be launched prior to rimegepant. Lasmiditan was designed to act through non-vasoconstrictive mechanisms in the 5-HT1 pathways such that patients who have cardiovascular risk factors, stable cardiovascular disease, or those who are dissatisfied with current triptan therapies could be treated. In August 2017, Lilly announced that lasmiditan met both its primary (pain freedom) and key secondary (most bothersome symptom) endpoints at 2 hours. In November 2018, Lilly announced NDA submission of lasmiditan for the acute treatment of migraine. Preliminary data from lasmiditan, compared with the results from the rimegepant program, would suggest ability to differentiate on both durability of benefit and AEs.
Other Oral CGRP Candidates in Development
Since we will be pursuing approval of our orally available, small molecule rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine, the most relevant comparator to rimegepant is the oral CGRP receptor antagonist under development from Allergan, ubrogepant. Allergan presented results from both of their Phase 3 studies (Achieve 1 annd Achieve 2) in 1H18. on These trials compared different doses (25, 50 and 100mg ) an earnings call from the first of their Phase 3 studies (Achieve 1). These studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of orally administered ubrogepant 25, 50 mg and 100 mg compared to placebo in a single migraine. The 50 and 100mg doses showed a statistically greater percentage of ubrogepant patients pain free at 2 hours as compared to placebo, as well as statistical significance on the co-primary, absence of the most bothersome migraine associated symptom at 2 hours post dose. Patients were permitted to take a second dose of investigational product or rescue medication after the 2 hour time point. Durability of effect at 24 hours was not achieved with all doses (only the 100mg dose demonstrated 24-hour sustained pain relief). Ubrogepant was well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. There were 6 cases of LFTs (ALT or AST) >3x ULN (1 on placebo, 5 on ubrogepant): 2 cases of LFTs >5x ULN on ubrogepant and 1 case of LFTs >10x ULN on ubrogepant in Achieve 1 and 4 cases of LFTs (ALT or AST) >3x ULN (1 on placebo and 3 on ubrogepant 50mg). No cases were determined to have a probable relationship to study drug. There were no cases of Hy's Law. Launch of ubrogepant is anticipated in the first quarter 2020. Based on the published Phase 2 studies with both of rimegepant and ubrogepant, and the data presented to date from the Phase 3 studies of ubrogepant, we believe rimegepant has the potential to be best-in-class. Allergan is a global pharmaceutical company with presence in the CNS area and, in particular, with physicians treating chronic migraine through its Botox franchise.
Other Acute Treatments for Migraine
Ergot alkaloids (such as Dihydroergotamine ("DHE")), analgesics, including opioids, NSAIDs, acetaminophen and antiemetics also are used in the acute treatment of migraine. DHE is also a potent vasoconstrictor and has been primarily displaced by the introduction of the triptans. Opioid use for migraine is associated with increased disability and health care utilization. Opioids, while effective for headache pain, are not approved for migraine and carry risk of abuse and addiction.
Migraine Prevention Treatments
Agents currently used to reduce the frequency of migraine episodes were first approved for other uses (e.g. beta blockers, antidepressants, anticonvulsants). Botox is the only product that has been approved by the FDA for the prevention of chronic migraine (defined as at least 15 headache days per month, at least 8 of which are migraine). For those patients who do not qualify as having chronic migraine, but still have significant disability due to migraine, there are five products approved by the FDA for use: topiramate (Topamax) and valproic acid (Depakote), both anticonvulsant medicines, propranolol (Inderal) and timolol (Blocadren), both beta-blockers, and amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant.
Table of Contents

The biologic CGRP therapies have been studied for the prevention of migraine with three agents approved in 2018. . The three new FDA-approved drugs, Aimovig (erenumab-aooe), Ajovy (fremanezumab-vfrm), and Emgality (galcanezumab-gnlm), are all administered subcutaneously.These therapies, while effective, do not eliminate the need for acute treatment of migraine attacks. In addition, they all require SQ administration. We believe that BHV-3500 may have the opportunity to differentiate from these therapies due to its potential to be used for both the acute treatment and prevention of migraine.
Glutamate Platform
With respect to troriluzole, which we are currently developing for the treatment of ataxias, OCD, Alzheimer's disease, and GAD, there are currently no approved drug treatments for SCA or any other cerebellar ataxia, in the United States.
We are aware of companies with clinical stage programs in development for potential treatments for SCA and other cerebellar disorders, including Bioblast Pharma, which is in Phase 2 development of trehalose, which targets SCA 3 and acts as a protein stabilizer; Steminent Biotherapeutics, which is currently conducting a Phase 2 trial of allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells that target polyglutamine SCAs; EryDel which is planning a Phase 3 trial for its product, IEDAT01, which delivers dexamethasone sodium phosphate through red blood cells, Shionogi & CO., Ltd., which is investigating Rovatirelin, a non-peptide mimetic of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, in a Phase 3 trial in Japan; Shire Plc, which is exploring Cuvitru, an intravenous immune globulin that is approved for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency disorders, in Phase 2 development. Mitsubishi Tanabe received approval for taltirelin, an oral thyrotropin releasing hormone, in Japan in 2009 but has not filed with the FDA to seek approval in the United States.
With regards to OCD, there have been no new classes of drugs approved in over a decade. We are not aware of other product candidates besides troriluzole that are currently in clinical development targeting populations with OCD.
With respect to BHV-0223, which we are developing for the treatment of ALS, we believe our primary competitor is Covis Pharmaceuticals, which sells Rilutek, the brand name for riluzole. Riluzole is also generically available. Edaravone (Radicava, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma) was recently approved by the FDA in May 2017 for the treatment of ALS, based on efficacy studies conducted in Japan with the vast majority of patients on background riluzole therapy. Edaravone is administered to patients by intravenous infusion. We are aware of at least two other companies that are marketing or plan to market new formulations of riluzole: Aquestive Therapeutics has publicly announced they plan to file an NDA for a riluzole oral soluble film in 2019, and Italfarmaco SpA, a private Italian company, markets an oral liquid suspension formulation of riluzole in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe under the brand name Tiglutik. Tiglutik, the US brand name for Italfarmaco's oral liquid suspension formulation of riluzole  was approved for marketing in the United States in September 2018. Being that an oral suspension still requires swallowing in a population prone to dysphagia, we believe an oral dissolvable tablet that may not require swallowing will have significant market preference. We are aware of several companies that are exploring potential treatments for ALS, mostly agents with novel mechanisms of action being administered with riluzole. We are not aware of any company marketing or developing a sublingual formulation of riluzole. Other companies of which we are not aware may also be developing formulations using the API riluzole; if such companies pursued regulatory approval of such product candidates using the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, those product candidates would potentially compete with BHV-0223. For example, Italfarmaco and Aquestive have obtained orphan designation for their products, and are eligible to obtain orphan exclusivity subject to a showing of clinical superiority to riluzole. Based on orphan drug designation requirements, the first approval of a novel formulation of riluzole may obligate subsequent formulations to demonstrate advantages with regard to safety, efficacy or meaningful contribution to patient care, in order to achieve marketing authorization.
With respect to BHV-5000, which we are developing for the treatment of Rett syndrome, there are currently no approved treatments for Rett syndrome in the United States. We are aware of companies with clinical stage programs in development for potential treatments for Rett syndrome, including Newron Pharmaceuticals SpA which is launching a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of sarizotan, an agent with serotonin subtype-1A (5-HT1A) receptor agonist and dopamine subtype-2 (D2) receptor antagonist activities, and Neuren Pharma, which has completed a Phase 2a trial of trofinetide in adult patients and a Phase 2 trial in pediatric patients with Rett syndrome.
If we expand our development of troriluzole, BHV-0223 or BHV-5000 into additional neuropsychiatric or other indications, we would face substantial competition from companies that develop or sell products that treat those indications.
Other Platforms
With respect to verdiperstat, which we are developing for the treatment of MSA, there are currently no approved treatments for MSA in the United States. We are not aware of any planned or ongoing late stage development programs for
Table of Contents

 MSA. Nevertheless, we are aware of companies who have, at some time, declared that they are developing potential treatments for MSA, including the following:
•Prana Biotechnology Ltd, PBT434 is a small molecule purported to inhibit the aggregation of α-synuclein and tau that was granted orphan drug designation in the US in January 2019;
•AFFiRiS AG;
•Corestem Inc;
•MitoDys Therapeutics Ltd;
•Modag GmbH; and
•Neuropore Therapies Inc.
Manufacturing
We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if our product candidates receive marketing approval.
Our lead product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
Commercialization
We intend to develop and, if approved by the FDA, commercialize our product candidates in the United States, and we may enter into distribution or licensing arrangements for commercialization rights for other regions.
With respect to rimegepant and BHV-3500, we plan to build a specialty team of sales and medical marketing professionals to focus on targeting neurological specialists and headache centers in the United States, potentially in combination with a larger pharmaceutical partner, to maximize patient coverage in the United States and to support global expansion.
With respect to the product candidates in our glutamate modulation and MPO platforms, we currently intend to build a neurological specialty sales force to manage commercialization for these product candidates on our own.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain the proprietary position of our products and our other development programs.
Patents and Patent Applications
We have approximately 500 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications in our portfolio related to the composition of matter, methods of use, methods of manufacture or formulations of our product candidates which have been filed in major markets throughout the world, including the United States, Europe, Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong and Australia. About 1/3 of the patents and patent applications support the Glutamate platform and 2/3 supports the CGRP platform.
Rimegepant and BHV-3500
The intellectual property rights related to rimegepant and BHV-3500 are in-licensed from BMS and are covered by five families of U.S. and certain selected foreign patents, with statutory expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2033. U.S. Patent 8,314,117 covers the composition of matter of rimegepant, and has a statutory expiration date of October 12, 2030, not including patent term adjustment or any potential patent term extension. U.S. Patent 8,481,546 covers the composition of matter of BHV-3500, and has a statutory expiration date of March 2, 2031, not including patent term adjustment or any potential patent term extension. These or other patents cover rimegepant and BHV-3500 and their use in treating migraine and, in certain ex-U.S. jurisdictions, other neurological conditions. The license also includes several patent families of related compounds directed to the CGRP receptor. We also have an agreement with Catalent whereby Catalent granted an exclusive license under certain of its patents and technology to use the Zydis ODT technology for development of our rimegepant product. Catalent retains all manufacturing rights.
Table of Contents

Troriluzole
We own several families of patent applications containing claims directed to prodrugs of riluzole. These patent applications include several U.S. applications and corresponding PCT applications. These families of patent applications contain claims directed to troriluzole and numerous other prodrugs of riluzole. In addition, the use of these compounds for treating ALS, SCA, depression and other diseases is described and claimed in these patent applications. We own these patent applications subject to a license agreement with ALS Biopharma and Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc. If a patent covering troriluzole issues from one of these pending patent application families, it would have a statutory expiration date in 2036. Other patent applications provide coverage for alternative formulations of riluzole prodrugs and their uses.
BHV-0223
BHV-0223, a sublingual or ODT form of riluzole, and its use for treating various forms of pain, ALS and depression are covered by patent applications pending in the U.S. and selected foreign jurisdictions having a statutory expiration date in 2035. We have an agreement with Catalent whereby Catalent granted an exclusive license under certain of its patents and technology to use the Zydis ODT technology for our BHV-0223 product. Catalent retains all manufacturing rights. In addition to patent protection, although not an NCE, BHV-0223 may also be entitled to certain regulatory exclusivity. In addition to the patent applications we own, we have also licensed one issued patent and several pending patent applications from Yale University which provide protection for the use of riluzole in treating generalized anxiety disorder and other neurological uses, respectively. Further, we have licensed several patents from Rutgers University covering the use of riluzole for treating various forms of cancer and an animal model for tumors which may cover the use of BHV-0223 for treating the specific cancers.
BHV-5000
We have also in-licensed one patent family related to certain uses of lanicemine and a patent application family containing claims directed to BHV-5000 from AstraZeneca. They contain claims directed to the use of the base compound, lanicemine, in treating depression, and the structure of the prodrug form, BHV-5000, as well as the use of the prodrug in treating a variety of neurological diseases including Rett syndrome and depression. The issued patents related to uses of lanicemine have a statutory expiration date in 2020. Two U.S. patents have been granted that are directed to BHV-5000 and its uses and have a statutory expiration date in 2034. Corresponding foreign patents are pending.
Verdiperstat
In September 2018, we in-licensed a patents from AstraZeneca relating to the composition of matter of verdiperstat, pharmaceutical compositions and various neurological diseases including muscular system atrophy. The patent applications have been filed in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other countries. Three U.S. patents have been granted. The pending applications and granted patents have expiration dates from 2025 to 2034, not including possible patent term extensions.
Additional Licensed Patent Applications
We have also licensed a family of patent applications related to the treatment of depression with a combination of ketamine and scopolamine from Massachusetts General Hospital.
Patent Protection and Terms
The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent's term may, in certain cases, be extended by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the "Hatch-Waxman Act") permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension is not available for all approved products and, even if an approved product is eligible, only one patent covering the approved product may be extended, the extension can only be based on a single approved product, and the total extension granted cannot extend the remaining term of the patent beyond 14 years from product approval.
Furthermore, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products and processes like those we intend to develop and commercialize are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, can make it easier to challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of any patents that may issue, and, more generally, could affect
Table of Contents

 the value of intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents.
Third-Party Patent Filings
Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Moreover, we may be aware of patent applications, but incorrectly predict the likelihood of those applications issuing with claims of relevance to us.
Under U.S. law, a person may be able to patent a discovery of a new way to use a previously known compound, even if such compound itself is patented, provided the newly discovered use is novel and non-obvious. Such a method-of-use patent, however, if valid, only protects the use of a claimed compound for the specified methods claimed in the patent. This type of patent does not prevent persons from using the compound for any previously known use of the compound. Further, this type of patent does not prevent persons from making and marketing the compound for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method.
License Agreements
License Agreement with BMS
Overview
In July 2016, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with BMS for the development and commercialization rights to rimegepant and BHV-3500, as well as other CGRP-related intellectual property. Subject to certain limitations and certain retained rights of BMS, the license included an exclusive license under certain BMS patent rights and BMS know-how to the extent necessary to research, discover, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, export and import licensed compounds and licensed products in the field of prevention, treatment or control of any disease, disorder or condition in humans. In exchange for these rights, we agreed to pay BMS initial payments, milestone payments and tiered royalties on net sales of licensed products under the agreement. Our initial payments to BMS totaled $9.0 million and were paid within 90 days after entering into the agreement. The milestone payments due to BMS under the agreement consist of development and commercial milestones. The development milestones due under the agreement depend on the licensed product being developed. Development milestones due under the agreement with respect to rimegepant or a derivative thereof total up to $127.5 million, and, for any product other than rimegepant or a derivative thereof, total up to $74.5 million. Commercial milestones total up to $150.0 million for each licensed product. If we receive revenue from sublicensing any of our rights under the agreement, we are also obligated to pay a portion of that revenue to BMS as well. The tiered royalty payments are based on annual worldwide net sales of licensed products under the agreement, with percentages in the low-to-mid teens.
We made a payment of $5.0 million to BMS pursuant to our obligations under the BMS agreement during the third quarter of 2017 for the achievement of a specified milestone.
Our Development, Regulatory and Commercialization Obligations
Under the agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products using the patent rights we have licensed from BMS, including setting forth a development plan with specific development activities and timelines, updating the development plan each year, providing BMS with annual reports of our progress and keeping BMS informed of material changes that may affect the development plan. With respect to any of the licensed products, we are solely responsible for all development, regulatory and commercial activities and costs. We are also obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve specified regulatory and commercial milestones, and maintain a sufficient supply of our products to satisfy our expected commercialization efforts in each country in which we sell such products. Following our first commercial sale of a product, we must provide BMS with periodic reports of our commercial activities. In connection with the agreement, BMS agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assign and transfer any INDs for the licensed compounds to us.
Equity Consideration
As part of the agreement, we agreed to issue BMS common shares in the amount of $12.5 million upon the occurrence of specified events, including upon an initial public offering ("IPO"). In satisfaction of this obligation, in May 2017 upon the completion of our IPO, we issued 1,345,374 common shares to BMS.
Table of Contents

Non-Competition
Until 2023, neither we nor our affiliates may, ourselves or through or in collaboration with a third party, engage directly or indirectly in the clinical development or commercialization of specified competitive compounds. In the event that we are or become non-compliant with this provision due to licensing, collaboration or acquisition activity, we must either divest ourselves of the competitive compound within a certain period of time, discontinue the development of the competitive compound, or negotiate with BMS to have the competitive compound included as a licensed product under our agreement with BMS. The failure to so divest or reach terms with BMS may result in the termination of our license with BMS.
Term and Termination
The agreement will terminate on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the royalty term with respect to each licensed product in each country. The patents related to the licensed products have statutory expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2033.
BMS has the right to terminate the agreement upon our insolvency or bankruptcy, our uncured material breach, including our failure to meet our development and commercialization obligations, our challenge to any BMS patent rights, or our failure to close a financing within specified parameters. We have the right to terminate the agreement if BMS materially breaches the agreement or if, after we provide notice, we choose not to move forward with development and commercialization in a specific country. In the event that BMS exercises its right to terminate the agreement following our insolvency, our breach of the agreement or our failure to develop or commercialize the licensed compounds, or if we terminate the agreement after providing notice, all rights and licenses granted to us will terminate, and all patent rights and know-how transferred pursuant to the agreement will revert to BMS. In addition, upon such termination, we agree to, at BMS's election, (i) assign all regulatory filings, approvals and regulatory documents necessary to further develop and commercialize the reverted products or (ii) withdraw or inactivate such filings and approvals.
Amendment to License Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
In March 2018, the Company entered into an Amendment to License Agreement (the “BMS Amendment”) with BMS, which amends the License Agreement between the Company and BMS from July 2016 (the “Original License Agreement” and, as amended by the BMS Amendment, the “BMS License Agreement”). Under the BMS Amendment, the Company paid BMS an upfront payment of $50.0 million in return for a low single-digit reduction in the royalties payable on net sales of rimegepant and a mid single-digit reduction in the royalties payable on net sales of BHV-3500, recorded in Research and Development expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Under the Original License Agreement, the Company was obligated to make tiered royalty payments based on annual worldwide net sales of licensed products upon their approval and commercialization, with percentages in the low- to mid-teens.
The BMS Amendment also removes BMS’s right of first negotiation to regain its intellectual property rights or enter into a license agreement with the Company following the Company’s receipt of topline data from its Phase 3 clinical trials with rimegepant, and clarifies that antibodies targeting CGRP are not prohibited as competitive compounds under the non-competition clause of the Original License Agreement.
The BMS License Agreement continues to provide the Company with exclusive global development and commercialization rights to rimegepant, BHV-3500 and related CGRP molecules, as well as related know-how and intellectual property. The Company’s obligations to make development and commercial milestone payments to BMS under the Original License Agreement remain unchanged.
Agreement with ALS Biopharma, LLC and Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center Inc.
In August 2015, we entered into an agreement with ALS Biopharma and Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc. ("FCCDC") pursuant to which ALS Biopharma and FCCDC assigned to us their worldwide patent rights to a family of over 300 prodrugs of glutamate modulating agents, including troriluzole, as well as other innovative technologies. In addition, we received a non-exclusive license to certain trade secrets and know-how of ALS Biopharma. We took assignment of these patent rights subject to the provisions of the Bayh Dole Act, as applicable, to the extent that any invention included with the assigned patent rights was funded in whole or in part by the United States government. In addition, certain of the patent rights that do not cover troriluzole were co-owned by Rutgers, and thus, we took assignment of these patent rights subject to the co-ownership interest of Rutgers. Under the agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently commercialize and develop markets for the patent products.
As consideration for this assignment of patent rights, we paid ALS Biopharma $2.5 million between August 2015 and November 2016 as funding for research to be performed by ALS Biopharma in connection with a mutually agreed upon research plan. We are also obligated to pay regulatory milestone payments of $3.0 million upon a specified regulatory approval for the first licensed product under the agreement as well as additional milestone payments of $1.0 million for each licensed
Table of Contents

 product that completes the specified regulatory milestone thereafter. We are also obligated to make royalty payments of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of products licensed under the agreement, payable on a quarterly basis.
Equity Consideration
As part of the agreement, we also issued to ALS Biopharma 50,000 common shares as well as two warrants to purchase a total of 600,000 common shares with an exercise price of $5.60 per share, of which 275,000 shares were immediately exercisable at issuance and the remaining 325,000 shares became exercisable upon our achievement of a specified regulatory milestone. This milestone was achieved in May 2016. We also agreed to grant specified preemptive rights to ALS Biopharma to participate in equity offerings that are open to our other shareholders.
In January 2018, ALS Biopharma exercised a warrant for the purchase of 275,000 shares through a net share settlement. The Company issued 228,119 shares as a result of the exercise.
Term and Termination
The agreement terminates on a country-by-country basis as the last patent rights expire in each such country. Our current patent rights consist of owning several families of patent applications. If a patent covering troriluzole issues from one of these pending patent applications, it would have a statutory expiration date in 2036. ALS Biopharma has the right to terminate the agreement or its applicability to one or more countries upon 30 days' prior written notice to us if we fail to make an undisputed payment within the 60-day period after receipt of a termination notice or if we commit a material breach of the agreement that is not cured within the 60-day period after receipt of a termination notice. We have the right to terminate the agreement if ALS Biopharma commits a material breach of the agreement that is not cured within the 60-day period after written notice thereof from us or, as to a specific country, if no valid claims exist in such country. Both we and ALS Biopharma may terminate the agreement as to a specific country if we are enjoined from exercising our patent rights under the agreement in such country. If we affirmatively abandon our development, research, licensing or sale of all products covered by one or more claims of any patent or patent application assigned under the agreement, or if we cease operations, we have agreed to reassign the applicable patent rights back to ALS Biopharma.
2016 License Agreement with AstraZeneca
Overview
In October 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca, or the 2016 AstraZeneca Agreement, pursuant to which AstraZeneca granted us a license to certain patent rights and know-how for all human uses for the commercial development, manufacture, distribution and use of any products or processes resulting from development of those patent rights, including BHV-5000 and lanicemine.
Under the 2016 AstraZeneca Agreement, we have the right to sublicense our rights under the agreement subject to AstraZeneca's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. We will be responsible for preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents and applications, and for Orange Book listing any listable patents. We have the right to enforce the licensed patents and to defend challenges to the validity or enforceability of the licensed patents. AstraZeneca, however, retains the right to apply for patent term extensions for the licensed patents. We may not assign our rights or delegate our obligations under the 2016 AstraZeneca Agreement without AstraZeneca's consent, including in the event of a change of control.
In exchange for these rights, in addition to the agreement to issue equity consideration noted below, we agreed to pay AstraZeneca an upfront payment, milestone payments and royalties on net sales of licensed products under the agreement. We made the upfront payment to AstraZeneca of $5.0 million upon signing the agreement. The milestone payments due to AstraZeneca under the agreement consist of regulatory and commercial milestones. The regulatory milestones due under the agreement depend on the indication of the licensed product being developed as well as the territory where regulatory approval is obtained. Development milestones due under the agreement with respect to Rett syndrome total up to $30.0 million, and, for any indication other than Rett syndrome, total up to $60.0 million. Commercial milestones are based on net sales of all products licensed under the agreement and total up to $120.0 million. We have agreed to pay tiered royalties of mid single-digit to low double-digit percentages based on net sales of products licensed under the agreement. If we receive revenue from sublicensing any of our rights under the agreement, we are also obligated to pay a portion of that revenue to AstraZeneca.
Our Development, Regulatory and Commercialization Obligations
Under the agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, and obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for, licensed products using the rights we have licensed from AstraZeneca, including providing AstraZeneca with annual reports of our development activities. With respect to any of the licensed products, we are solely responsible for all development, regulatory and commercial activities and costs. Following our first commercial sale of a
Table of Contents

 product, we must provide AstraZeneca with periodic reports of our commercial activities. AstraZeneca agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer all of its regulatory documentation related to BHV-5000 and lanicemine in each country to us, including all INDs, NDAs and approvals, promptly following the effective date of the agreement.
Right of First Negotiation
After we receive topline data from the first Phase 2b study of a product candidate licensed under the agreement, we must provide notice and a summary of the data to AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca will then have a period of time to exercise its right of first negotiation to regain its intellectual property rights or enter into a sublicense agreement with us. If AstraZeneca does not give notice of its intent to exercise its right of first negotiation during this time period, or we do not execute a definitive agreement within an additional time period, we will have the sole right, in our discretion, to negotiate and execute any agreement with third parties, or to retain our rights.
Equity Consideration
As part of the consideration, we agreed to issue to AstraZeneca common shares in the amount of $5.0 million if we completed a financing within specified parameters. This condition was satisfied upon the closing of our Series A preferred share financing, at which time we issued 538,150 Series A preferred shares to AstraZeneca which, at the completion of our IPO, automatically converted into 538,150 common shares. In addition, we agreed to issue to AstraZeneca common shares in the amount of $5.0 million upon the completion of specified events, including upon an IPO. In satisfaction of this obligation, in May 2017 upon the completion of our IPO, we issued an additional 538,149 common shares to AstraZeneca.
Term and Termination
The 2016 AstraZeneca Areement will terminate upon the expiration of the last royalty term for the last licensed product under the agreement. Each royalty term begins on the date of the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country and ends on the later of 10 years from such first commercial sale or the expiration of the last to expire of the applicable patents in that country. The patent applications related to BHV-5000 would, if issued, have a statutory expiration date in 2033. Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party's uncured material breach or upon insolvency or bankruptcy. AstraZeneca also has the right to terminate the agreement in certain circumstances. We have the right to terminate the agreement without cause. In the event the agreement is terminated in its entirety for any reason, all rights and licenses granted to us by AstraZeneca under the agreement, and all sublicenses granted by us under the agreement, immediately terminate, and we are required to assign to AstraZeneca all of the regulatory documentation applicable to any licensed compound or licensed product owned or controlled by us or our affiliates, to transfer control of any clinical studies involving licensed products to AstraZeneca and continue such studies at our cost for six months, and to assign to AstraZeneca all of our agreements with third parties that are reasonably necessary for the exploitation of the licensed products.
2018 License Agreement with AstraZeneca
Overview
In September 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca, or the 2018 AstraZeneca Agreement, pursuant to which AstraZeneca granted us exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize verdiperstat. In exchange for these rights, we paid AstraZeneca an upfront cash payment of $3.0 million and issued AstraZeneca 109,523 common shares, valued at $4.1 million on the date of settlement. We are obligated to pay milestone payments to AstraZeneca totaling up to $55.0 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones and up to $50.0 upon the achievement of specified sales-based milestones. In addition, we will pay AstraZeneca tiered royalties ranging from high single-digit to low double-digits based on net sales of specified approved products, subject to specified reductions.
We may sublicense our rights under the 2018 AstraZeneca Agreement and, if we do so, we will be obligated to pay a portion of any milestone payments received from the sublicensee to AstraZeneca in addition to any milestone payments we would otherwise be obligated to pay. 
Our Development, Regulatory and Commercialization Obligations
Under the 2018 AstraZeneca Agreement, we are solely responsible, and have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts, for all development, regulatory and commercial activities related to verdiperstat. We are also responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of the patents related to verdiperstat and have the first right to prosecute infringement of the patents and defend challenges to the validity or enforceability of the patents.
Term and Termination
The 2018 AstraZeneca Agreement terminates on a country-by-country basis and product-by-product basis upon the expiration of the royalty term for such product in such country. Each royalty term begins on the date of the first commercial sale
Table of Contents

 of the licensed product in the applicable country and ends on the later of 10 years from such first commercial sale or the expiration of the last to expire of the applicable patents in that country. The 2018 AstraZeneca Agreement may be terminated earlier in specified situations, including termination for uncured material breach of the 2018 AstraZeneca Agreement by either party, termination by AstraZeneca in specified circumstances, termination by us on a country-by-country basis with advance notice and termination upon a party’s insolvency or bankruptcy.
Agreements with Catalent U.K. Swindon Zydis Limited
In March 2015, we entered into a development and license agreement with Catalent pursuant to which we obtained certain license rights to the Zydis ODT technology in BHV-0223. BHV-0223 was developed under this agreement. Catalent has manufactured BHV-0223 for clinical testing and we expect them to do so for commercial supply. We made an upfront payment of $0.3 million to Catalent upon entering into the agreement and are obligated to pay Catalent up to $1.6 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones. We are also obligated to make royalty payments of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of products licensed under the agreement.
Under the agreement, we are responsible for conducting clinical trials and for preparing and filing regulatory submissions. We have the right to sublicense our rights under the agreement subject to Catalent's prior written consent. Catalent has the right to enforce the patents covering the Zydis technology and to defend any allegation that a formulation using Zydis technology, such as BHV-0223, infringes a third party's patent.
The development and license agreement terminates on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) 10 years after the launch of the most recently launched product in such country and (ii) the expiration of the last valid claim covering each product in such country, unless earlier voluntarily terminated by us. Our current patent rights with respect to BHV-0223 consist of owning several patent applications. If a patent covering BHV-0223 issues from one of these pending patent applications, it would have a statutory expiration date in 2035. The agreement automatically extends for one-year terms unless either party gives advance notice of intent to terminate. In addition, Catalent may terminate the agreement either in its entirety or terminate the exclusive nature of the agreement on a country-by-country basis if we fail to meet specified development timelines, which we may extend in certain circumstances.
In January 2018, we entered into a development and license agreement with Catalent pursuant to which we obtained certain license rights to the Zydis ODT technology for use with rimegepant. If we obtain regulatory approval or launch a rimegepant product that utilizes the Zydis ODT technology, we are obligated to pay Catalent up to $1.5 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones. If we commercialize a rimegepant product that utilizes the Zydis ODT technology, the agreement permits us to purchase the commercial product from Catalent at a fixed price, inclusive of a royalty. Under the agreement, Catalent agreed that it will not develop or manufacture a formulation of any oral CGRP compound using Zydis ODT technology for itself or a third party for a specified period of time, subject to certain minimum commercial revenues.
In July 2018, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Catalent pursuant to which Catalent will exclusively manufacture and supply our worldwide requirements for rimegepant in the Zydis ODT delivery formulation, if we pursue and receive  regulatory approval of this formulation of rimegepant, for an initial term of five years after its commercial launch with optional two-year renewal periods. Under the agreement, Catalent will supply the rimegepant Zydis ODT product at a fixed price, inclusive of a royalty, and will not develop or manufacture a formulation of any oral CGRP compound using Zydis ODT technology for itself or a third party for a specified period of time, subject to certain minimum commercial revenues.
License Agreement with Yale University
In September 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Yale to obtain rights under certain patent rights for the commercial development, manufacture, distribution, use and sale of products and processes resulting from the development of those patent rights related to the use of riluzole in treating various neurological conditions such as general anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. As part of the consideration for this license, we issued Yale 250,000 of our common shares and granted Yale the right to purchase up to 10% of the securities issued in each of our equity offerings. Under the terms of the agreement, in the event of a change of control, as defined in the agreement to include our IPO, we will be obligated to pay to Yale the lesser of (i) 5% of the dollar value of all initial and future potential consideration paid or payable by the acquirer or (ii) $1.5 million as a change-of-control payment. In the event of an IPO, which we completed in May 2017, the change-of-control payment to Yale is reduced by the value of Yale's equity investment in our company. The value of this change-of-control payment was determined to be zero at the expiration of the lockup period in October 2017 since the value of shares at the end of the lockup were worth more than their initial equity investment.
In addition, we agreed to pay Yale regulatory milestone payments of up to $2.0 million and annual royalty payments of a low-single digit percentage based on net sales of products from the licensed patents, subject to a minimum amount of up to
Table of Contents

 $1.0 million per year. If we grant any sublicense rights under the agreement, we must pay Yale a low single-digit percentage of sublicense income that we receive.
The agreement also requires us to meet certain due diligence requirements based upon specified milestones. We can elect to extend the due diligence requirements by a maximum of one year upon payments of up to $150,000 to Yale. We are also required to reimburse Yale for any fees that Yale incurs related to the filing, prosecution, defending and maintenance of patent rights licensed under the agreement. In the event that we fail to make any payments, commit a material breach, fail to maintain adequate insurance or if we challenge the patent rights of Yale, Yale can terminate the agreement. We can terminate the agreement with 90-days' notice if Yale commits a material breach or in a specific country if there are no valid patent rights. The agreement expires on a country-by-country basis upon the later of expiration of the patent rights or ten years from the date of first sale. Any patent that has issued or does issue from one of the pending patent applications under this agreement would have a statutory expiration date in 2026.
License Agreement with The General Hospital Corporation d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital
In September 2014, we entered into a license agreement with The General Hospital Corporation d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital ("MGH") pursuant to which MGH granted us a license under certain patent rights for the commercial development, manufacture, distribution and use of any products or processes resulting from development of those patent rights, related to treating depression with a combination of ketamine and scopolamine. Under this agreement, we paid MGH an upfront license fee of $20,000. We are also obligated to pay MGH annual license maintenance fees up to $50,000, beginning in 2017. In addition, we are obligated to pay MGH future milestone payments of up to $750,000 upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones and up to $2.5 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones. We have also agreed to pay MGH royalties of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of products licensed under the agreement. We are also required to reimburse MGH for any fees that MGH incurs related to the filing, prosecution, defending and maintenance of patent rights licensed under the agreement. If we receive revenue from sublicensing any of our rights under the agreement, we are also obligated to pay a portion of that revenue to MGH.
The agreement expires upon the expiration of the patent rights licensed under the agreement, which could occur as early as 2033, unless earlier terminated by either party.
License Agreement with Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey
In June 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, licensing several patents and patent applications related to the use of riluzole to treat various cancers. Certain of the Rutgers patent rights were developed using federal funding. Accordingly, the U.S. Government has certain rights in the Rutgers patents and applications. We have the right to sublicense our rights under the Rutgers Agreement. We are responsible for prosecuting and maintaining the patents and applications in the Rutgers patent rights, and Rutgers has an opportunity to review and comment on correspondences with government patent offices. We have the right to prepare any documents related to the application for an extension of the term of any licensed patent and to list any listable patents in the Orange Book. We have the first right to enforce the licensed patents.
Under this agreement, we are required to pay Rutgers annual license maintenance fees of up to $25,000 per year until the first commercial sale of a licensed product. We are also obligated to pay Rutgers payments totaling up to $825,000 upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones. We also agreed to pay Rutgers royalties of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of licensed products sold by us, our affiliates or sublicensees, subject to a minimum of up to $100,000 per year. If we grant any sublicense rights under the license agreement, we must pay Rutgers a low double-digit percentage of sublicense income we receive. In the event that we experience a change of control or sale of substantially all of our assets prior to the initiation of a Phase 3 trial related to products licensed under the agreement, and such change of control or sale results in a full liquidation of our company, we will be obligated to pay Rutgers a change-of-control fee equal to 0.3% of the total value of the transaction, but not less than $100,000.
The agreement also requires us to meet certain due diligence requirements based upon specified milestones. We can elect to extend the due diligence requirements by a maximum of one year upon payments to Rutgers of up to $500,000 in the aggregate.
The agreement expires on a country-by-country basis upon the later of expiration of the last patent rights to expire in such country, which could occur as early as 2024, or ten years from the date of first commercial sale of a licensed product, unless terminated by either party.

Revenue Participation Right with Royalty Pharma
In June 2018, pursuant to a Funding Agreement we entered into with Royalty Pharma ("RPI") we granted to RPI the right to receive certain revenue participation payments, subject to certain reductions, based on the future global net sales of the pharmaceutical products containing the compounds rimegepant or BHV-3500 and certain derivative compounds thereof ("Products"), for each calendar quarter during the royalty term contemplated by the Funding Agreement, in exchange for $100.0 million in cash. Specifically, the participation rate commences at 2.1 percent on annual global net sales of up to and equal to $1.5 billion, declining to 1.5 percent on annual global net sales exceeding $1.5 billion.
Optional License Agreement with the University of Connecticut
In October 2018, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide option and license agreement (the "UConn Agreement") with the University of Connecticut ("UConn") for the development and commercialization rights to UC1MT, a therapeutic antibody targeting extracellular metallothionein. Under this agreement, we have the option to acquire an exclusive, worldwide license to UC1MT and its underlying patents to develop and commercialize throughout the world in all human indications. If we choose to exercise the option, we would be obligated to pay UConn milestone payments upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercial milestones, and royalties of a low single-digit percentage of net sales of licensed products.
Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including imposition of a clinical hold, refusal by the FDA to approve applications, withdrawal of an approval, import/export delays, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are governed by extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The FDA, under the FDCA, regulates pharmaceutical products in the United States. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:
•preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under GLP;
•the submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence;
•approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB"), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
•adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each indication and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices ("GCP");
•the preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
•FDA acceptance, review and approval of the NDA, which might include an Advisory Committee review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are made to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMPs").
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain. The FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Preclinical and Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of the product candidate, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of preclinical trials is subject to federal regulations and requirements including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and
Table of Contents

 analytical data, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced. The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. The FDA may nevertheless initiate a clinical hold after the 30 days if, for example, significant public health risks arise.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at each of the sites at which the trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution.
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap or be combined. These phases generally include the following:
Phase 1.    Phase 1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently healthy volunteers. In Phase 1, the product candidate is usually tested for safety, including adverse effects, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacodynamics.
Phase 2.    Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to (1) evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications, (2) determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
Phase 3.    If a product candidate is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 clinical trials, the clinical trial program will be expanded to Phase 3 clinical trials to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
Phase 4.    clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post-market requirements or commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in enforcement action or withdrawal of approval.
A Phase 2/3 trial design, which we are using in ourBHV-3500 and troriluzole development programs, is often used in the development of pharmaceutical and biological products. The trial includes Phase 2 elements, such as an early interim analysis of safety or activity, and Phase 3 elements, such as larger patient populations with less restrictive enrollment criteria. The early interim analysis of clinical or physiologic activity and/or safety allows the study to be stopped, changed or continued before a large number of patients have been enrolled, while still allowing all data from enrolled patients to count in the analysis used to support approval.
Submission and Review of an NDA
The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the product's manufacture, composition, quality, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, requesting approval to market the product. The application must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment, which typically increases annually, although waivers may be granted in limited cases. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.
Once an NDA has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission, the FDA sets a user fee goal date that informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review. This is typically 10 months from the date that the FDA accepts the application for filing for standard review NDAs (i.e., NDAs seeking approval of drugs that are not new molecular entities). The review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities comply with cGMPs. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites for compliance with GCP and integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy.
During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy ("REMS") is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS, and the FDA will not approve the application without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval. The FDA could also require a special warning, known as a boxed warning, to be included in the product label in order to highlight a particular safety risk. The FDA may also convene an
Table of Contents

 advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit and interpretation of clinical trial data. The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and/or the FDA requires additional testing or information. The FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
On the basis of the FDA's evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA will issue either an approval of the NDA or a Complete Response Letter, detailing the deficiencies in the submission and the additional testing or information required for reconsideration of the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
Approved drugs that are manufactured or distributed in the United States pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims and some manufacturing and supplier changes are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for marketed products, as well as new application fees for certain supplemental applications.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The FDA may also require a REMS, which could involve requirements for, among other things, medication guides, special trainings for prescribers and dispensers, patient registries, and elements to assure safe use.
In addition, entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. The FDA has promulgated specific requirements for drug cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may issue enforcement letters or withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Corrective action could delay product distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities.

Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of drugs previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This type of application permits reliance for such approvals on literature or on an FDA finding of safety, effectiveness or both for an approved drug product. As such, under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA may rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for the new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
Our clinical programs for troriluzole for the treatment of SCA and BHV-0223 for the treatment of ALS are each based on a regulatory pathway under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA that allows reference to data on riluzole for the purpose of safety assessments.
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant's product or an approved method of using the product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA"), seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify, for each patent listed in the Orange Book for the referenced drug, to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, (2) such patent has expired, (3) if such patent has not expired, the date on which it expires or (4) such patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The fourth certification described above is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a "section viii" statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of- use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. This section viii statement does not require notice to the patent holder or NDA owner. There might also be no relevant patent certification.
If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. Even if the 45 days expire, a patent infringement lawsuit can be brought and could delay market entry, but it would not extend the FDA-related 30-month stay of approval.
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.
Non-Patent Exclusivity
In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug.
A drug, including one approved under a 505(b)(2) application, may obtain a three-year period of non-patent market exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the three-year exclusivity period. A 505(b)(2) NDA may also be subject to a five-year exclusivity period for a new chemical entity, whereby the FDA will not accept for filing, with limited exception, a product seeking to rely upon the FDA's findings of safety or effectiveness for such new chemical entity.

Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or in other limited cases. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan drugs may be eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing. In addition, an NDA for a product that has received orphan drug designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated. A Company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA.
Generally, if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same active moiety for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as another drug's showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different active moieties for the same indication or obtain approval for the same active moiety for a different indication. In some cases, orphan drug status is contingent on a product with an orphan drug designation showing that it is clinically superior to a previously approved product or products.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and other geographies, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Coverage, Reimbursement and Pricing
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, and private entities, such as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. For example, the payor's reimbursement payment rate may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. However, one third-party payor's decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Further, some third-party payors may require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they provide reimbursement for use of such therapies.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product. These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. Thus, obtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is time-consuming and costly.

The U.S. and foreign governments regularly consider reform measures that affect health care coverage and costs. For example, the U.S. and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription products. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act ("collectively, the ACA") contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of products, including, for example, increased rebates for products sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies' share of sales to federal health care programs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") moved 30% of Medicare payments to alternative payment models tied to the quality or value of services by 2016. Additionally, HHS had set a goal of moving 50% of Medicare payments into these alternative payment models by the end of 2018, but due to a policy shift under the Trump Administration, it is unclear how and when such changes will be implemented. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for our products.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the focus on cost containment measures, particularly in the United States, has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if we attain favorable coverage and reimbursement status for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
European Union Coverage Reimbursement and Pricing
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies, or so called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company.
Healthcare Laws and Regulations
Physicians, other healthcare providers, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors are and will be subject to various federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may impact, among other things, our arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare professionals who participate in our clinical research programs, healthcare professionals and others who purchase, recommend or prescribe our approved products, and our proposed sales, marketing, distribution, and education programs. The U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation, the following:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federally funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value;
•The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the federal civil monetary penalties law and the civil False Claims Act (which can be enforced by private citizens through qui tam actions), prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of federal funds, and knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
•The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") which imposes criminal liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
Table of Contents

•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 ("HITECH") and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without the appropriate authorization by entities subject to the law, such as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their respective business associates;
•The federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid ("CHIP") to report to HHS information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; and
•Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that impose similar restrictions and may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs, comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians and other health care providers; and state health information privacy and data breach notification laws, which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
We will be required to spend substantial time and money to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. Recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these federal and state healthcare laws. For example, the ACA amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes to clarify that liability under these statutes does not require a person or entity to have actual knowledge of the statutes or a specific intent to violate them. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
Violations of these laws can subject us to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions including monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and reputational harm, we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. Moreover, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state laws and regulations, proposed and implemented, that could impact our future operations and business.
Healthcare Reform
The legislative landscape in the United States continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following:
•an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, which is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
•a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (and 70% commencing January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
•new requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and certain others, including reporting “transfers of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers and reporting investment interests;
Table of Contents

•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
•a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
•extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
•a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
•establishment of the Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of any certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the "individual mandate". Additionally, on January 23, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called "Cadillac" tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices.
In addition, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, as a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011, providers are subject to Medicare payment reductions of 2% per fiscal year through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments from providers from three to five years. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 also introduced a quality payment program under which certain individual Medicare providers will be subject to certain incentives or penalties based on new program quality standards. Payment adjustments for the Medicare quality payment program will begin in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program.
Further, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the costs of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States has also been the subject of considerable discussion, and members of Congress and the Trump Administration have stated that they will address such costs through new legislative and administrative measures. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
