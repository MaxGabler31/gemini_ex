Item 1. Business
 
The Company has developed an exclusive coalition of professionally-managed online media channels, based on a Company developed technology platform. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has generated less than $100,000 in revenue. The Company is actively expanding advertising, membership and other business operations. During 2017 the Company’s operations primarily consisted of software development, building a list of selective, invite-only Channel Partners, and reaching out to potential Channel Partners for discussion. Each channel is operated by an invite only Channel Partner, drawn from subject matter experts, reporters, group evangelists and social leaders. Channel Partners publish content and oversee an online community for their respective channels, leveraging the Company’s proprietary, socially-driven, mobile-enabled, video-focused technology platform engaging niche audiences within a single coalition.


We operate websites at www.TheMaven.net and www.Maven.io. The information contained on our official website and information about the Company on any other personal, viral, social network informational websites or software applications, will not constitute part of this report or future reports or schedules filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or other state securities regulatory bodies.
 
The Company’s strategy includes acquiring related online media, publishing and technology businesses by merger or acquisition that management believes will expand the scale of unique users interacting on our technology platform. We believe that with an increased scale in unique users, we will be able to obtain improved advertising terms and grow advertising revenue. In 2018, the Company has announced agreements related to two proposed acquisitions:
 
On March 13, 2018, the Company and HubPages, Inc. (“HubPages”), together with HP Acquisition Co., Inc. (“HPAC”) that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which HPAC will merge with and into HubPages, with HubPages continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). The objective of this acquisition is to accelerate TheMaven’s growth by adding thousands of content creators and tens of millions of users, to improve traffic to the Company site and increase engagement with users and improve monetization from advertisers.


On March 19, 2018, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent to acquire Say Media Inc. (“Say Media”), a media and publishing technology company (the “Letter of Intent”). The acquisition will be subject to negotiation and execution of definitive documentation and various conditions precedent. In connection with the Letter of Intent on March 26, 2018 Maven loaned $1 million to Say Media and was issued a secured promissory note in the principal amount of $1 million from Say Media. The Note bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum and is secured against all of the assets of Say Media. The Note is due and payable on the six-month anniversary of the earlier of (i) the termination of the Letter of Intent or (ii) if Maven and Say Media should execute a definitive agreement with respect to the proposed acquisition, the termination of the definitive agreement.


This acquisition follows the HubPages acquisition and objectives, further expanding content, engagement and monetization opportunities from advertisers.


Funding Required for Acquisition of HubPages, Inc.
 
The Merger Agreement provides that all issued and outstanding common stock and preferred stock of HubPages, along with all outstanding vested stock options issued by HubPages will be exchanged for an aggregate of $10 million in cash (the “Merger Consideration”). The aggregate Merger Consideration to be issued at closing shall be reduced by (i) $1.5 million to be held in escrow to satisfy any indemnification obligations due under the Merger Agreement and (ii) to the extent that a seller-side representation and warranty insurance policy is obtained and bound at closing, 50% of the total premium, underwriting costs, brokerage commissions and other fees and expenses of such policy.
 
Funding Required for Acquisition of Say Media, Inc. 
 
The Maven is negotiating the acquisition of Say Media, and it anticipates that the final terms of the acquisition will require financing to pay a portion of the consideration at the closing. The current estimate of funding to complete the transaction, as previously disclosed, is approximately $10 million, however as all the terms are in discussion the actual amount of funding and timing has yet to be determined. 
 
We have no contracts or arrangements for any additional funding at this time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any funding or will be able to meet our accrued obligations. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations. These estimates may change significantly depending on the nature of our business activities and our ability to raise capital from our shareholders or other sources.
 
There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. We will pursue various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.
 
The shares of Common Stock of the Company are traded in the over-the-counter market (OTC), under the trading symbol “MVEN.” Historically the frequency of trades and the volume of trading has been low, and there can be no assurance that an active or sustained public market for our shares will develop. Additionally, the price of a share of our Common Stock has been volatile, and there can be no assurance that the price will stabilize or be consistent in the future.
 
Corporate History
 
Our Subsidiary, TheMaven Network, Inc., was incorporated in Nevada on July 22, 2016 (“Inception”), under the name “Amplify Media, Inc.” On July 27, 2016, the corporate name was amended to “Amplify Media Network, Inc.” and on October 14, 2016, the corporate name was changed to “TheMaven Network, Inc.” On March 5, 2018, the corporate name was changed to Maven Coalition, Inc.
 
TheMaven, Inc., the parent company, was formerly known as Integrated Surgical Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Integrated”). From June 2007 until November 4, 2016, Integrated was a non-active “shell company” as defined by regulations of the SEC. On August 11, 2016, Integrated entered into a loan to Subsidiary that provided initial funding totaling $735,099 for the Subsidiary’s operations. On October 14, 2016 Integrated entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“Share Exchange Agreement”) with the Subsidiary and the shareholders of the Subsidiary holding all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Subsidiary (collectively, “Subsidiary Shareholders”). The Share Exchange Agreement was amended on November 4, 2016, to include certain newly issued shares of the Subsidiary in the transaction and make related changes to the agreement and the Share Exchange was consummated. The transaction resulted in the Company acquiring Subsidiary by the exchange of all of the outstanding shares of Subsidiary for 12,517,152 newly issued shares of the common stock, $0.01 par value (“Common Stock”) of Parent, representing approximately 56.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately after the transaction. We refer to this transaction as the “Recapitalization.” The Recapitalization was consummated on November 4, 2016, as a result of which TheMaven Network, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Integrated (“Closing”). The note payable between Integrated and Subsidiary was an interdependent transaction with the Recapitalization and was ultimately cancelled upon closing of the Recapitalization. On December 2, 2016, Integrated amended its Certificate of Incorporation to change its name from “Integrated Surgical Systems, Inc.” to “TheMaven, Inc.”

Our executive offices are located at 1500 Fourth Avenue, Suite 200, Seattle, WA 98101. At this location we also carry out the software development and other operational activities of the Company. The current telephone number is (775) 600-2765.
 
Recapitalization Accounting
 
From June 2007 until the closing of the Recapitalization, Integrated was a non-active “shell company” as defined by regulations of the SEC and, accordingly, the Recapitalization was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization rather than a business combination. As the Subsidiary is deemed to be the purchaser for accounting purposes under reverse recapitalization accounting, the Company’s financial statements are presented as a continuation of Subsidiary, and the accounting for the Recapitalization is equivalent to the issuance of stock by Subsidiary for the net monetary assets of Parent as of the Closing accompanied by a recapitalization.  
Maven Overview
 
Maven Business
 
Prior to founding Maven in 2016, its founding team worked on a variety of digital media platforms, with the common thread of achieving economies of scale by assembling a coalition of publishers, covering particular niche media interests, on a unified technology and business platform. One of the founders and the Chief Executive Officer of Maven, Mr. James C. Heckman, created the first version of this model in 1991, leveraging early digital technology for NFL teams for “NFL Exclusive,” and later founded Rivals.com, which is still operated today by Yahoo!, and Scout.com, operated today by CBS. Maven’s founders have worked together since 1999, building many different socially focused, single platform media models, including Scout.com, Rivals.com, Rivals.net (Europe), Zazzle, and 5to1.com.
 
Maven was founded as an entirely new enterprise to build and operate an exclusive coalition of professionally managed media channels and interest groups, each operated by a group of experts, reporters, group evangelists and social leaders as “Channel Partners.” These Channel Partners are able to leverage Maven’s proprietary, socially-driven, mobile-enabled, video-focused technology platform to engage niche audiences within a single coalition (“the Maven Platform”).
 
Our media model has attracted an approximate aggregate audience of unique users of 4.3 million unique users as of December 31, 2017, and 6.0 million unique users at March 31, 2018, as reported by Google Analytics. We believe that our media model will appeal to the users and subscribers of the Maven Platform in a way similar to how the model has previously appealed to sports fans in our founders’ previous ventures. We intend the Maven Platform to appeal to professional publishers who currently struggle to monetize on their existing platforms or are operating with less-than-world-class features in one or more areas (mobile, video, community, etc.). The consumer-facing product of the Maven Platform is made available on the web and as iOS (Apple) and Android mobile applications. Our merger and acquisition strategy is intended to bring related online media, publishing and technology companies into our coalition and onto our world-class technology platform, thus increasing our scale of unique users and our range of services.


After the launch of our digital media platform in May 2017, we generated in the 2017 fiscal year total revenue of less than $100,000 from advertising and memberships (subscriptions). In the long term, we believe that there will be two primary revenue sources, one of which will be online advertising and sponsorships and one of which will be paid memberships (subscriptions). We expect that advertising and sponsorships will be more than 80 percent of our total revenues and will be sold primarily by Maven and/or major media partner(s) to companies to promote their brands, products and services, amplify their visibility and target an audience based on the professionally managed media channels and interest groups on the Maven Platform. During 2017 the Company’s operations primarily consisted of software development, building a list of selective, invite-only Channel Partners, and reaching out to potential Channel Partners for discussion. The management team has extensive experience in the past building partner coalitions.
 
At 2017 year end, we had 32 active Channel Partners and at March 31, 2018, we had 43 active Channel Partners. In each case, we have additional signed Channel Partners, however, there is no assurance that these additional Channel Partners will become active on the Maven Platform. For a Channel Partner to migrate to our platform requires a substantial amount of effort by both the Channel Partner and our technology team, and not every Channel Partner, despite the best intentions, undertakes or achieves the migration.



 | As of December 31, 2017 | | As of March 31, 2018
--------------------------+-----------------------------+----+---------------------
Active Maven Channels | | 32 | | 43
Maven Channels in Process | | 39 | | 42

Technology and Intellectual Property
 
The Maven Platform was launched in “preview” form in May 2017 when the first channels went live and we continue to develop and incorporate state-of-the-art mobile, video, communications, social, notifications and other technology into the Maven Platform, including modern DevOps processes with continuous integration/continuous deployment and an entirely cloud-based back-end. The software engineering team is experienced at delivering service at extreme scale. We continue to develop the Maven Platform software by combining proprietary code with components from the open-source community, plus select commercial services. To the extent it is able and given the limited financial resources at its disposal, management is investing in core technical competencies to be able to do more product development.
 
We believe that innovation is one of the keys to our competitiveness and will be necessary for future sustained growth. Our innovation will be an essential element in being able to benefit from our planned acquisitions of HubPages and Say Media. Currently, Maven relies on the confidentiality of its operations, proprietary know-how and business secrets to protect our innovative platform. All Maven employees have entered into confidentiality agreements and the Company considers its employees’ work to be proprietary and owned by Maven. There can be no assurance that Maven will be able to enforce its rights if its intellectual property is improperly taken by Maven’s employees or adopted by its competitors without the approval of Maven.


In the future, when necessary and where practical, we will take additional steps to protect our intellectual property interests under the laws of the United States and the other jurisdictions in which we will operate. As the business develops, we plan to develop specific trademarks for our products and seek registration of those marks with government authorities for their protection. We also plan to seek opportunities to obtain patent protection. We do not currently hold any patents.
 
The competitive position of Maven may be seriously damaged if it cannot maintain its trade secrets and, in the future, obtain patent protection for any important differentiating aspects of its products or otherwise protect its intellectual property rights in its technology. Maven relies on a combination of contracts, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its technology. However, it may not be able to prevent misappropriation of its intellectual property, its competitors may be able to independently develop similar technology, and the agreements it enters into to protect its proprietary rights may not be enforceable.
 
The Company currently has multiple pending United States, Canadian, and International (Madrid Protocol) trademark applications directed to variations of its primary key design logo and name, with the International trademark applications designating Australia, China, the European Union, India, Japan and New Zealand.  Moreover, the Company holds a European Union Intellectual Property Office trademark registration for the word mark, THEMAVEN, in multiple classes.  The Company has continued to file updated trademark applications to reflect its branding evolution and intends to continue strengthening its trademark portfolio as financial resources permit.
 
Seasonality
 
We expect to experience typical media company advertising and sponsorship sales seasonality, which is strong in the fiscal fourth quarter and slower in the fiscal first quarter.
Competition
 
Currently we believe that there are dozens of competitors delivering niche media content on the web and on mobile devices and an even broader array of general media companies and major media brands. All those competitors use mobile alerts, invest heavily in video and leverage social media. We believe that Maven has developed distribution, production and technology tactics that are superior because our management team’s tactics in the past with prior companies have proven to be highly engaging and effective for our particular model, which organizes channels into interest groups, led by its expert partners – the Channel Partners.
 
The web provides unlimited access to the market by niche or general media companies, so there are a large number and variety of direct competitors of Maven competing for audience and ad and sponsorship dollars. The general business of online media, combined with some level or method of leveraging community attracts many potential entrants, and in the future, there may be strong competitors that will compete with Maven in general or in selected markets. These and other companies may be better financed and be able to develop their markets more quickly and penetrate those market more effectively. Below is a list of possible competitors and categories:
 

· | Vice, Buzzfeed, Business Insider et al – niche content, leveraging social, mobile and video, competing for ad dollars
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fortune, CNN, ESPN, Yahoo!, Google, et al – general content, major media companies, competing for ad dollars
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | WordPress, Medium, RebelMouse, Arc – content management software, open to all including experts and professionals, competing for publishers
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit – social platforms open to all including experts and professionals
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Affiliate networks such as Liberty Alliance – competing for ad dollars
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that Maven competes on the basis of its technology, ease of use, value delivered to consumers and Channel Partners, and platform evolution through a continuing development program. We believe that we will also compete by growing through mergers and acquisition of other companies that have related online media, publishing and technology businesses intended to expand the scale of unique users interacting on our technology platform. We believe that an increased scale in unique users will result in improved advertising terms and concomitant growth in advertising revenue. We believe that Maven’s methods, technology and experience enable it to compete for a material amount of market share of media dollars and subscription revenue. We also believe Maven is rapidly establishing a reputation for its business, distribution and technology methods within selected initial markets, which can be enhanced over time as Maven gains customer awareness and channel partner success. Concurrent with the growth of its customer base, we believe Maven will develop brand awareness, which translates to sponsorship support, and will obtain data from its users that will allow Maven to expand our content and advertising offerings.
 
We believe that innovation is one of the keys to our competitiveness, and innovation will be necessary for future sustained growth. To the extent it is able, and given the limited financial resources at our disposal, the Company is investing in core technical competencies to be able to do more product development. Furthermore, we will file to protect our intellectual property in appropriate market segments. The Company expects that in future periods it will continue to use a substantial amount of its financial resources for development of its platform and products.
 
Research and Development 
 
Research and development costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and amounted to $114,873 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and, $411,741 for the period from July 22, 2016 (Inception) to December 31, 2016.
Website Development Costs
 
In the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company has spent $2,605,162 which was capitalized as Website Development Costs. In the period since Inception on July 22, 2016 through December 31, 2016, the Company spent $540,146 which was capitalized as Website Development Costs. The Company recorded amortization expense related to capitalized website development costs of $512,252 in 2017 and zero in 2016, respectively.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2018, the Company had twenty-nine full-time employees, of which six were in senior executive positions, fifteen were in software development, testing, and operations, five were in business and publisher development and three were in administration. None of the employees is covered by any collective bargaining agreement. In the future, Maven expects to expand its management employees for financial compliance and add operational employees as the channel partner coalition expands. Its future success will depend in part on its ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel.
Government Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state laws and regulations that involve privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, or other subjects. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate.
 
A number of government authorities, both in the United States and abroad, and private parties are increasing their focus on privacy issues and the use of personal information. Most states have enacted some form of data privacy legislation, including data breach notification laws, and laws penalizing the misuse of personal information in violation of published privacy policies. Certain states have also enacted legislation requiring certain encryption technologies for the storage and transmission of personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and more states are considering laws for or have enacted laws about information security regulations and may require the adoption of written information security policies that are consistent with state laws if businesses have personal information of residents of their states. Data privacy and information security legislation also is being considered at the federal level, among other statutes and regulations concerning privacy of individuals and use of internet and market information. In the United States the FTC and attorneys general in several states have oversight of business operations concerning the use of personal information and breaches of the privacy laws under existing consumer protection laws. In particular, an attorney general or the FTC may examine privacy policies to ensure that a company fully complies with representations in the policies regarding the manner in which the information provided by consumers and other visitors to a website is used and disclosed by it and the failure to do so could give rise to a complaint under state or federal unfair competition or consumer protection laws. We will have to review our privacy policies and our overall operations on a regular basis to assure compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state laws, and to the extent applicable, any foreign laws. Our business could be adversely affected if new regulations or decisions regarding the storage, transmission, use and/or disclosure of personal information are implemented in such ways that impose new or additional technology requirements on us, limit our ability to collect, transmit, store and use the information, or if government authorities or private parties challenge our privacy practices that result in restrictions on us, or we experience a significant data or information breach which would require public disclosure under existing notification laws and for which we may be liable for damages and/or penalties.

There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies, including a data protection regulation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has been finalized and is due to come into force in or around May 2018. The GDPR will include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different than those currently in place in the European Union, and that will include significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.


The United States Congress enacted the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM, regulating “commercial electronic mail messages” (i.e., e-mail), the primary purpose of which is to promote a product or service. The FTC has promulgated various regulations applying CAN-SPAM and has enforcement authority for violations of CAN-SPAM. Any entity that sends commercial e-mail messages for itself and clients, and those who re-transmit such messages, must adhere to the CAN-SPAM requirements. Violations of its provisions may result in civil money penalties and criminal liability. Compliance with these provisions may limit our ability to send certain types of e-mails on our own behalf and on behalf of our advertising clients. While we intend to operate our businesses in a manner that complies with the CAN-SPAM provisions, we may not be successful in so operating. If it turns out we have violated the provisions of CAN-SPAM we may face enforcement actions by the FTC or FCC or face civil penalties, either of which could adversely affect our business.
 
In addition to the federal CAN-SPAM regulations, many states have comparable legislation. There have been a number of cases brought as class actions based on the federal and state statutes. At the state level the courts have tended to decide in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded substantial damages. An award of damages, at either the federal or state level could have a detrimental impact on our financial results.
 
Social networking websites are under increasing scrutiny. Legislation has been introduced on the state and federal level that could regulate social networking websites. Some rules call for more stringent age-verification techniques, attempt to mandate data retention or data destruction by Internet providers, and impose civil and/or criminal penalties on owners or operators of social networking websites.
 
The FTC regularly considers issues relating to online behavioral advertising and has issued reports containing a new set of “guidelines” for industry self-regulation. The FTC’s reports and issue consideration may result in future regulation at the federal and state levels of the collection and use of online consumer data, which could potentially place restrictions on our ability to utilize our database and other marketing data on our own behalf and on behalf of our advertising clients, which may adversely affect our business.
 
Legislation concerning the above described online activities has either been enacted or is in various stages of development and implementation in other countries around the world and could affect our ability to make our websites available in those countries as future legislation is made effective. It is possible that state and foreign governments might also attempt to regulate our transmissions of content on our website or prosecute us for violations of their laws.
 
Governments of states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities even though we do not have a physical presence and/or operate in those jurisdictions. As our platforms, products and advertisement activities are available over the Internet anywhere in the world, multiple jurisdictions may claim that we are required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each of those jurisdictions and pay various taxes in those jurisdictions. We address state and local jurisdictions where we have nexus, however, there can be no assurance that we have complied with all jurisdictions that may assert that we owe taxes.
 
Property
 
Maven until May 5, 2018 subleased approximately 2,900 square feet for its executive offices and operational facilities on a month-to-month basis at 2125 Western Avenue, Suite 502, Seattle, WA 98121. The annual lease payments aggregate to approximately $72,000.
 
On April 25, 2018, Maven entered into an office sublease agreement to sublease of 7,457 rentable square feet at 1500 Fourth Avenue, Suite 200, Seattle, Washington 98101. The sublease has a term of 41 months, commencing on June 1, 2018, with base rent at a rate of $25.95 per square foot per annum in months 1 through 12, rising to $37 per square foot in months 37 to 41. Upon execution of the sublease in April 2018, the Company paid $60,249 as prepaid rent and a security deposit of $22,992.
 
The Company believes that the rates it is paying under its property lease are competitive in the Seattle real estate market, and it would be able to find comparable lease properties in the event it changed locations.
