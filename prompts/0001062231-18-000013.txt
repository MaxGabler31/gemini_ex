Research and Development (R&D)
We continue to invest in the development of new products, processes and systems to improve efficiency and flexibility in our operations and continue to deliver innovative new products to our customers. 
In 2017, R&D spending was $161.5 million as compared to $139.8 million in 2016 and $113.9 million in 2015. The focus of this investment continues to be developing innovative products for the automotive market. Product development includes power transfer units, transfer cases, driveline and transmission differentials, multi-piece driveshafts, constant velocity joints, torque transfer devices, chassis modules and front and rear drive axles. We continue to focus on electronic integration in our existing and future products to advance their performance. We also continue to support the development of hybrid and electric vehicle systems. Special emphasis is placed on the development of products and systems that provide our customers with advancements in fuel efficiency and emissions reduction, and improved performance metrics such as noise vibration harshness (NVH), power density, and traction control improvements for safety and stability. Our efforts in these areas have resulted in the development of prototypes and various configurations of our products for several customers throughout the world.
Our e-AAM subsidiary engineers and develops battery electric and hybrid driveline systems to be commercialized for crossover vehicles and passenger cars. These systems are designed to improve fuel efficiency, reduce CO2 emissions and provide AWD capability with the additional benefit of improved vehicle stability when compared to traditional mechanical AWD systems.
We have also developed and commercialized a disconnecting AWD system, which strengthens AAM's position as a leader in global technology. AAM's EcoTrac® Disconnecting AWD system technology seamlessly engages AWD functionality while improving fuel efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions. This technology is featured on the newly designed Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain, as well as the AWD Jeep Cherokee and its derivatives.
AAM also develops and manufactures high-efficiency axle systems through the use of proprietary technologies to optimize product design and lubrication management, while significantly reducing friction and improving fuel economy.

Backlog
We typically enter into agreements to provide our products for the life of our customers' vehicle programs. Our new and incremental business includes awarded programs and incremental content and volume including customer requested engineering changes. Our backlog may be impacted by various assumptions, many of which are provided by our customers based on their long range production plans. These assumptions include future production volume estimates, changes in program launch timing and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. 
Our gross new and incremental business backlog is approximately $1.5 billion for programs launching from 2018 to 2020. In 2016, our gross new and incremental business backlog was approximately $875.0 million for programs launching from 2017 to 2019. The increase in our backlog for 2018 to 2020, as compared to 2017 to 2019 is primarily the result of our acquisition of MPG.
Of this $1.5 billion new and incremental business backlog, approximately 40% is for end use markets outside of North America. Light trucks, including crossover vehicles and SUVs, make up approximately 80% of the $1.5 billion backlog, and approximately 80% of our backlog relates to non-GM business.

Patents and Trademarks
We maintain and have pending various U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and other rights to intellectual property relating to our business, which we believe are appropriate to protect our interest in existing products, new inventions, manufacturing processes and product developments. We do not believe that any single patent or trademark is material to our business nor would expiration or invalidity of any patent or trademark have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to compete.
Cyclicality and Seasonality
Our operations are cyclical because they are directly related to worldwide automotive production, which is itself cyclical and dependent on general economic conditions and other factors. Our business is moderately seasonal as our major OEM customers historically have an extended shutdown of operations (typically 1-2 weeks) in conjunction with their model year changeover and an approximate one-week shutdown in December. Our major OEM customers also occasionally have longer shutdowns of operations (up to 6 weeks) for program changeovers. Accordingly, our quarterly results may reflect these trends.
Litigation and Environmental Matters
We are involved in various legal proceedings incidental to our business. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effort on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws, regulations and ordinances, including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. We will continue to closely monitor our environmental conditions to ensure that we are in compliance with all laws, regulations and ordinances. We have made, and anticipate continuing to make, capital and other expenditures (including recurring administrative costs) to comply with environmental requirements. Such expenditures were not significant in 2017, 2016 and 2015.
On April 6, 2017, we completed our acquisition of MPG. A subsidiary of MPG, Grede Wisconsin Subsidiaries LLC (Grede Wisconsin), had been under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency for alleged Clean Air Act violations and alleged obstruction of justice relating to the January 2012 removal of debris from the roof of a heat treat oven that was purported to contain asbestos at a now closed Grede facility in Berlin, Wisconsin. The United States Attorney, Eastern District of Wisconsin, indicted Grede LLC and Grede II LLC, the parent company of Grede Wisconsin. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we settled this matter for approximately $0.5 million.
Associates
We employ over 25,000 associates on a global basis (including our joint venture affiliates) of which approximately 11,500 are employed in the U.S. and approximately 13,500 are employed at our foreign locations. Approximately 5,000 are salaried associates and approximately 20,000 are hourly associates. Of the 20,000 hourly associates, approximately 60% are covered under collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.
