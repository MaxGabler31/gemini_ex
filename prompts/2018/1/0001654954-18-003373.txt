 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  General Information
  
 Noble Roman’s, Inc., an Indiana corporation incorporated in 1972, sells and services franchises and licenses and operates Company-owned foodservice locations for non-traditional foodservice operations and stand-alone restaurants under the trade names “Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub”, “Noble Roman’s Pizza,” “Noble Roman’s Take-N-Bake,” and “Tuscano’s Italian Style Subs.” The concepts’ hallmarks include high quality fresh pizza, pasta and salads along with other related menu items, simple operating systems, fast service times, attractive food costs and overall affordability.
  
 For more rapid growth in future revenue, in 2017 the Company began adding Company-owned Craft Pizza & Pub locations to its business and also intends to add franchised Craft Pizza & Pub locations primarily to multi-unit operators. The Craft Pizza & Pub added significant revenue and is expected to add much more in future years. The Company opened two Craft Pizza & Pub locations in 2017, a third location in January 2018 and now has a fourth under development with plans to open it in late May 2018. Since 1997, the Company had concentrated its efforts and resources primarily on franchising and licensing non-traditional locations and has now awarded franchise and/or license agreements in all 50 states. The Company is continuing its focus on franchising/licensing non-traditional locations, even though it added focus on Craft Pizza & Pub.
  
 Pizzaco, Inc. currently owns and operates two Company-owned non-traditional locations, RH Roanoke, Inc. operates a Company-owned location and Noble Roman’s, Inc. owns and operates three Craft Pizza & Pub locations with a fourth now under development. The Company intends to use its Craft Pizza & Pub locations as a base to support the franchising of that concept.
  
 References in this report to the “Company” are to Noble Roman’s, Inc. and its three wholly-owned subsidiaries, Pizzaco, Inc., N.R. Realty, Inc. and RH Roanoke, Inc., unless the context requires otherwise.
  
  Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub
  
 Noble Roman's Craft Pizza & Pub is intended to provide a fun, pleasant atmosphere serving pizza and other related menu items, all made fresh using fresh ingredients in the view of the customers. In January 2017, the Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub opened its first Company-owned restaurant in Westfield, Indiana, a prosperous and growing community on the northwest side of Indianapolis. Since that time two additional Craft Pizza & Pubs have been opened as Company-owned restaurants with a fourth location now under development. Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub is designed to harken back to the Company’s early history when it was known simply as “Pizza Pub.” Like then, and like the new full-service pizza concepts today, ordering takes place at the counter and food runners deliver orders to the dining room for dine-in guests. The Company believes that Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub features many enhancements over the current competitive landscape. The restaurant features two styles of hand-crafted, made-from-scratch pizzas with a selection of 40 different toppings, cheeses and sauces from which to choose. Beer and wine also are featured, with 16 different beers on tap including both national and local craft selections. Wines include 16 high quality, affordably priced options by the bottle or glass in a range of varietals. Beer and wine service is provided at the bar and throughout the dining room.

 The pizza offerings feature Noble Roman’s traditional hand-crafted thinner crust as well as its signature deep-dish Sicilian crust. After extensive research and development, the system has been designed to enable fast cook times, with oven speeds running approximately 2.5 minutes for traditional pies and 5.75 minutes for Sicilian pies. Traditional pizza favorites such as pepperoni are options on the menu, but also offered is a selection of Craft Pizza & Pub original creations like "Swims With The Fishes" and "Pizza Marguerita". The menu also features a selection of contemporary and fresh, made-to-order salads and fresh-cooked pasta. The menu also includes baked subs, hand-sauced wings and a selection of desserts, as well as Noble Roman’s famous Breadsticks with Spicy Cheese Sauce.
  
 Additional enhancements include a glass enclosed “Dough Room” where Noble Roman’s Dough Masters hand make all pizza and breadstick dough from scratch in customer view. Also in the dining room is a “Dusting & Drizzle Station” where guests can customize their pizzas after they are baked with a variety of toppings and drizzles, such as rosemary-infused olive oil, honey and Italian spices. Kids and adults enjoy Noble Roman’s root beer tap, which is also part of a special menu for customers 12 and younger. Throughout the dining room and the bar area there are a large number of giant screen television monitors for sports and the nostalgic black and white shorts featured in Noble Roman’s earlier days.
  
  Noble Roman’s Pizza For Non-Traditional Locations
  
 The hallmark of Noble Roman’s Pizza for non-traditional locations is “Superior quality that our customers can taste.” Every ingredient and process has been designed with a view to produce superior results.
  
   ●
 A fully-prepared pizza crust that captures the made-from-scratch pizzeria flavor which gets delivered to non-traditional locations in a shelf-stable condition so that dough handling is no longer an impediment to a consistent product, which otherwise is a challenge in non-traditional locations.

   ●
 Fresh packed, uncondensed and never cooked sauce made with secret spices, parmesan cheese and vine-ripened tomatoes in all venues.

   ●
 100% real cheese blended from mozzarella and Muenster, with no soy additives or extenders.

   ●
 100% real meat toppings, with no additives or extenders, a distinction compared to many pizza concepts.

   ●
 Vegetable and mushroom toppings are sliced and delivered fresh, never canned.

   ●
 An extended product line that includes breadsticks and cheesy stix with dip, pasta, baked sandwiches, salads, wings and a line of breakfast products.

   ●
 The fully-prepared crust also forms the basis for the Company's Take-N-Bake pizza for use as an add-on component for its non-traditional franchise base as well as an offering for its grocery store license venue.

 
  Tuscano’s Italian Style Subs
  
 Tuscano’s Italian Style Subs is a separate non-traditional location concept that focuses on sub sandwich menu items but only in locations that also have a Noble Roman’s franchise. The ongoing royalty for a Tuscano’s franchise is identical to that charged for a Noble Roman’s Pizza franchise.
 Business Strategy
  
 The Company is focused on revenue expansion while continuing to minimize overhead and other related costs. To accomplish this the Company will continue owning and operating a core of Craft Pizza & Pub locations and develop what it believes to be a large growth opportunity by franchising to qualified multi-unit franchisees. At the same time, the Company will continue to focus on franchising/licensing for non-traditional locations by franchising primarily to convenience stores and entertainment centers and licensing to grocery stores.

 The initial franchise fees are as follows:
  
 
Franchise Format | Non-Traditional Except Hospitals | Hospitals | Traditional Stand-Alone
--------------------------+----------------------------------+-----------+------------------------
Noble Roman's Pizza | $7,500 | $10,000 | $30,000(1) 
Tuscano's Subs | $6,000 | $10,000 | - 
Noble Roman's & Tuscano's | $11,500 | $18,000 | - 


 
 (1) With the sale of multiple traditional stand-alone franchises to a single franchisee, the franchise fee for the first unit is $30,000, the franchise fee for the second unit is $25,000 and the franchise fee for the third unit and any additional unit is $20,000. The Company has not yet sold any Craft Pizza & Pub franchises.
  
 The franchise fees are paid upon signing the franchise agreement and, when paid, are deemed fully earned and non-refundable in consideration of the administration and other expenses incurred by the Company in granting the franchises and for the lost and/or deferred opportunities to grant such franchises to any other party.
  
 The Company’s proprietary ingredients are manufactured pursuant to the Company’s recipes and formulas by third-party manufacturers under contracts between the Company and its various manufacturers. These contracts require the manufacturers to produce ingredients meeting the Company’s specifications and to sell them to Company-approved distributors at prices negotiated between the Company and the manufacturer.
  
 The Company has distributors strategically located throughout the United States. The distributor agreements require the distributors to maintain adequate inventories of all ingredients necessary to meet the needs of the Company’s franchisees and licensees in their distribution areas for weekly deliveries. Each distributor distributes the ingredients to the franchisee/licensee at a price determined by the distributor agreement.
  
  Competition
  
 The restaurant industry and the retail food industry in general are very competitive with respect to convenience, price, product quality and service. In addition, the Company competes for franchise and license sales on the basis of product engineering and quality, investment cost, cost of sales, distribution, simplicity of operation and labor requirements. Actions by one or more of the Company’s competitors could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to sell additional franchises or licenses, maintain and renew existing franchises or licenses, or sell its products. Many of the Company’s competitors are very large, internationally established companies.
  
 Within the competitive environment of the non-traditional franchise and license segment of the restaurant industry, management has identified what it believes to be certain competitive advantages for the Company. First, some of the Company’s competitors in the non-traditional venue are also large chains operating thousands of franchised, traditional restaurants. Because of the contractual relationships with many of their franchisees, some competitors may be unable to offer wide-scale site availability for potential non-traditional franchisees. The Company is not faced with any significant geographic restrictions in this regard.
  
 Many of the Company’s competitors in the non-traditional venue were established with little or no organizational history operating traditional foodservice locations. This lack of operating experience may limit their ability to attract and maintain non-traditional franchisees or licensees who, by the nature of the venue, often have little exposure to foodservice operations themselves. The Company’s background in traditional restaurant operations has provided it experience in structuring, planning, marketing, and controlling costs of franchise or license unit operations which may be of material benefit to franchisees or licensees.

 The Company’s Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub format competes with similar restaurants in its service area. Some of the competitors are company-owned and some are franchised locations of large chains and others are independently owned. Some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the Company.
  
  Seasonality of Sales
  
 Extreme winter weather conditions, compared to the norm for the various regions of the country, adversely affect franchisee’s/licensee’s sales, especially Craft Pizza & Pub designed for in-store dining, which in turn affects Company revenue. Sales of non-traditional franchises or licenses may be affected by seasonalities and holiday periods. Sales to certain non-traditional venues may be slower around major holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, and during the first quarter of the year. Product sales of the non-traditional franchises/licenses may be slower during the first quarter of the year and certain venues such as grocery stores are typically slower during the summer months.
 Employees
  
 As of March 11, 2018, the Company employed approximately 33 persons full-time and 126 persons on a part-time, hourly basis, of which 21 of the full-time employees are employed in sales and service of the franchise/license units and 12 in restaurant locations. No employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes that relations with its employees are good.
 Trademarks and Service Marks
  
 The Company owns and protects several trademarks and service marks. Many of these, including NOBLE ROMAN’S®, Noble Roman’s Pizza®, THE BETTER PIZZA PEOPLE®, “Noble Roman’s Take-N-Bake Pizza,” “Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub®,” and "Tuscano’s Italian Style Subs®," are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as well as with the corresponding agencies of certain other foreign governments. The Company believes that its trademarks and service marks have significant value and are important to its sales and marketing efforts.
 Government Regulation
  
 The Company and its franchisees and licensees are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting the operation of the respective businesses. Each location, including the Company’s Craft Pizza & Pub locations, are subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety, sanitation, building, employment, alcohol and other agencies and ordinances in the state or municipality in which the facility is located. The process of obtaining and maintaining required licenses or approvals can delay or prevent the opening of a location. Vendors, such as our third-party production and distribution services, are also licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes, and U. S. Department of Transportation regulations. The Company, its franchisees, licensees and vendors are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, as well as laws and regulations relating to minimum wage and other employment-related matters. In certain circumstances, the Company is, or soon may be, subject to various local, state and/or federal laws requiring disclosure of nutritional and/or ingredient information concerning the Company’s products, its packaging, menu boards and/or other literature. Changes in the laws and rules applicable to the Company or its franchisees or licensees, or their interpretation, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

 The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and various state agencies pursuant to federal and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Several states also regulate aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires the Company to furnish to prospective franchisees a disclosure document containing specified information. Several states also regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of a franchise disclosure document with state authorities. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for additional federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship in certain respects. State laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship, and the Company is subject to applicable laws in each jurisdiction where it seeks to market additional franchised units.
