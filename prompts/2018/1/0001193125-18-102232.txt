OVERVIEW 
 Williams-Sonoma, Inc., incorporated in 1973, is a multi-channel specialty retailer of high quality products for the home. 
 In 1956, our founder, Chuck Williams, turned a passion for cooking and eating with friends into a small business with a big idea. He opened a store in Sonoma, California, to sell the French cookware that intrigued him while visiting Europe but that could not be found in America. Chucks business, which set a standard for customer service, took off and helped fuel a revolution in American cooking and entertaining that continues today. 
 In the decades that followed, the quality of our products, our ability to identify new opportunities in the market and our people-first approach to business have facilitated our expansion beyond the kitchen into nearly every area of the home. Growth across the Williams-Sonoma, Inc. portfolio has been fueled by three areas of strategic investment: brand experimentation and innovation, for a best-in-class approach to multi-channel retail experiences; operational excellence across the enterprise, from quality product and sourcing, to efficient manufacturing and supply chain; and culture and corporate social responsibility, from commitments to foster women in leadership and embrace diversity, to a healthy impact on our community and environment. 
 Today, Williams-Sonoma, Inc. is one of the United States largest e-commerce retailers with some of the best known and most beloved brands in home furnishings. We operate in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom and offer international shipping to customers worldwide. Our unaffiliated franchisees operate stores in the Middle East, the Philippines, Mexico and South Korea, as well as e-commerce websites in certain locations.

 E-COMMERCE OPERATIONS 
 As of January 28, 2018, the e-commerce channel had the following merchandise strategies: Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, West Elm, PBteen, Williams Sonoma Home, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham, which sell our products through our e-commerce websites and direct-mail catalogs. We offer shipping from many of our brands to countries worldwide, while our catalogs reach customers throughout the U.S. The e-commerce channel complements the retail channel by building brand awareness and acting as an effective advertising vehicle. In addition, we believe that our e-commerce websites and our direct-mail catalogs act as a cost-efficient means of testing market acceptance of new products and new brands. Leveraging these insights and our multi-channel positioning, our marketing efforts, including digital advertising and the circulation of catalogs, are targeted toward driving sales to each of our channels. Consistent with our published privacy policies, we send our catalogs to addresses from our proprietary customer list, as well as to addresses from lists of other mail order direct marketers, magazines and companies with which we establish a business relationship. In accordance with prevailing industry practice and our privacy policies, we may also rent our list to select mailers. Our customer mailings are continually updated to include new prospects and to eliminate non-responders.

  Mexico and South Korea that currently operate 93 franchised stores as well as e-commerce websites in certain locations.

Our retail stores serve as billboards for our brands, which we believe inspires our customers to also shop online and through our catalogs. 
 Detailed financial information about the retail channel is found in Note K to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 SUPPLIERS 
 We purchase most of our merchandise from numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 2% of our purchases during fiscal 2017. Approximately 65% of our merchandise purchases in fiscal 2017 were sourced from foreign vendors in 43 countries, predominantly in Europe and Asia. Approximately 99% of these purchases were negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. In addition, we manufacture merchandise, primarily upholstered furniture and lighting, at our facilities located in North Carolina, California and Oregon. 
COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY 
 The specialty retail business is highly competitive. Our specialty retail stores, e-commerce websites and direct-mail catalogs compete with other retailers, including large department stores, discount retailers, other specialty retailers offering home-centered assortments, other e-commerce websites and other direct-mail catalogs. The substantial sales growth in the direct-to-customer industry within the last decade, particularly in e-commerce, has encouraged the entry of many new competitors and an increase in competition from established companies. In addition, we face increased competition from discount retailers who, in the past, may not have competed with us or to this degree. We compete on the basis of our brand authority, the quality of our merchandise, service to our customers, our proprietary customer list, our e-commerce websites and our marketing capabilities, as well as the location and appearance of our stores. We believe that we compare favorably with many of our current competitors with respect to some or all of these factors. 
 Our business is subject to substantial seasonal variations in demand. Historically, a significant portion of our net revenues and net earnings have been realized during the period from October through January, and levels of net revenues and net earnings have typically been lower during the period from February through September. We believe this is the general pattern associated with the retail industry. In preparation for and during our holiday selling season, we hire a substantial number of additional temporary employees, primarily in our retail stores, customer care centers and distribution facilities, and incur significant fixed catalog production and mailing costs. 
 EMPLOYEES 
 As of January 28, 2018, we had approximately 27,800 employees, of whom approximately 10,900 were full-time. In preparation for and during our fiscal 2017 holiday selling season, we hired approximately 9,300 temporary employees primarily in our retail stores, customer care centers and distribution facilities.
