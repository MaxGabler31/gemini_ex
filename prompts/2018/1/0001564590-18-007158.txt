Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview 
 RH (the “Company”) is a leading luxury retailer in the home furnishings marketplace. Our curated and fully-integrated assortments are presented consistently across our sales channels in sophisticated and unique lifestyle settings that we believe are on par with world-class interior designers. We offer dominant merchandise assortments across a growing number of categories, including furniture, lighting, textiles, bathware, décor, outdoor and garden, tableware, and child and teen furnishings. We position our Galleries as showrooms for our brand, while our Source Books and websites act as virtual extensions of our stores. 
 The Company was formed as a Delaware corporation on August 18, 2011. On November 7, 2012, the Company completed an initial public offering. On December 15, 2016, Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc. filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to change its name to “RH,” effective January 1, 2017.
 On May 27, 2016, we acquired a controlling interest in Design Investors WW Acquisition Company, LLC, which owns the business operating under the name “Waterworks.” After the transaction, and giving effect to equity interests acquired by management in the business, we own in excess of 90% of the total equity interests in Waterworks.
 Our business is fully integrated across our multiple channels of distribution, consisting of our stores, Source Books, and websites. As of February 3, 2018, we operated a total of 83 retail Galleries consisting of 16 Design Galleries (10 next generation Design Galleries and 6 larger format Design Galleries), 47 legacy Galleries, 1 RH Modern Gallery and 4 RH Baby & Child Galleries throughout the United States and Canada, and 15 Waterworks Showrooms in the United States and in the U.K. In addition, as of February 3, 2018, we operated 32 outlet stores throughout the United States and Canada.
 Products and Product Development
 We have positioned RH as a lifestyle brand and design authority by offering dominant merchandise assortments. We are merchants of luxury home furnishings and our luxury products embody our design aesthetic and reflect inspiration from across the centuries and around the globe.
 We have developed a proprietary product development platform that is fully integrated from ideation to presentation. Key aspects of our product development platform are: 
  
• | Organization—We have established a collaborative, cross-functional organization centered on product leadership and coordinated across our product development, sourcing, merchandising, inventory and creative teams. Our product teams are focused on maximizing the sales potential of each product category across all channels, which eliminates channel conflicts and functional redundancies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Process—For many of our products, we work closely with our network of artisan partners who possess specialized product development and manufacturing capabilities and who we consider an extension of our product development team. We collaborate with our global network of specialty vendors and manufacturers to produce artisanal pieces on a large scale with a high level of quality and value, including both distinctive original designs and reinterpretations of antiques.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Facility—We have built the RH Center of Innovation and Product Leadership, a facility which supports the entire product development process from product ideation to presentation for all channels.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As a result of our proprietary organization, process and facility, our typical product lead times are 3 – 9 months, which enhances our ability to introduce more new products with each collection. In addition, our product development platform, sourcing capabilities and significant scale enable us to reduce our product costs.

Sales Channels 
 We distribute our products through a fully integrated sales platform comprised of our stores, catalogs and websites. We believe the level of integration among all of our channels and our approach to the market distinguishes us from most other retailers. For fiscal 2017, sales of products originating in our stores represented 56% of our net revenues, while sales from our direct business represented 44% of our net revenues. We believe our channels complement each other and our customers’ buying decisions are influenced by their experiences across more than one of our sales channels. We encourage our customers to shop across our channels and have aligned our business and internal organization to be channel agnostic. Our integrated distribution and product delivery network serves all of our channels. We believe the key advantage of our multiple sales channels is our ability to leverage the unique attributes of each channel in our approach to the market.
Stores 
 Retail Galleries
 Our retail Galleries are located primarily in upscale malls and street locations, as well as in iconic locations. We believe situating our Galleries in desirable locations is critical to the success of our business, and we identify Gallery locations based on a variety of factors, including timing of legacy Gallery lease expiration, deal economics, and availability of suitable new site locations based on several store specific aspects including geographic location, demographics, and proximity to affluent consumers. We pursue a market-based sales strategy, whereby we assess each market’s overall sales potential and how best to approach the market across all of our channels. We customize square footage, as well as catalog circulation, to maximize each market’s sales potential and increase our return on invested capital. 
 Our retail Galleries reinforce our luxury brand aesthetic and are highly differentiated from other home furnishings retailers. We have revolutionized the customer experience by showcasing products in a sophisticated lifestyle setting that we believe is on par with world-class interior designers, consistent with the imagery and product presentation featured in our catalogs and on our websites. Products in our Galleries are presented in fully appointed rooms, emphasizing collections over individual pieces. This presentation encourages a higher average order value as customers are inspired to consider purchasing a full collection of products to replicate the design aesthetic experienced in our Galleries. In addition, our store associates use iPads and other devices to allow customers to shop our entire merchandise assortment while in the Gallery.
 We operate the following distinct store types as of February 3, 2018:
  
1) | Design Galleries, which average approximately 33,000 leased selling square feet (inclusive of next generation Design Galleries which average 42,000 leased selling square feet and larger format Design Galleries which average 19,000 leased selling square feet);
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Legacy Galleries, which average approximately 8,000 leased selling square feet;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | The RH Modern Gallery, which is located in Los Angeles and is approximately 13,000 leased selling square feet;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | RH Baby & Child Galleries, which average approximately 4,000 leased selling square feet; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5) | Waterworks Showrooms, which average approximately 4,000 leased selling square feet.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have identified key learnings from our real estate transformation efforts during 2016 and 2017 that have supported our development of a new prototype Design Gallery that will enable us to escalate our new store opening cadence beginning in 2019. The new prototype will range in size from 33,000 square feet inclusive of our integrated hospitality experience to 29,000 square feet without, and will represent our assortments from RH Interiors, RH Modern, RH Baby & Child, RH TEEN and RH Outdoor. Due to the reduced square footage and efficient design, these new Galleries should be significantly more capital efficient and should have lower risk in the real estate development process both with respect to costs and time required for completion. We anticipate these new Galleries will represent approximately two thirds of our target markets and enable us to ramp from three to five new Galleries per year to a pace of five to seven. We will continue to develop and open larger more customized Bespoke Design Galleries in the top metropolitan markets, and indigenous smaller format Bespoke Galleries in second home markets that have attractive customer demographics. As an example of the smaller Bespoke Gallery format, in 2018 we expect to open RH Yountville, the Gallery in the Napa Valley. 
 We continue to evaluate potential opportunities for standalone RH Baby & Child, RH TEEN and RH Modern Galleries in key markets.
 In fiscal 2015, RH unveiled its initial foray into hospitality at RH Chicago, The Gallery at the Three Arts Club. This first of its kind retail concept provides a seamlessly integrated culinary offering, including the 3Arts Club Café, the 3Arts Club Wine Vault & 
 2


Tasting Room, and the 3Arts Club Pantry & Espresso Bar. Building on the success in Chicago, RH introduced an integrated hospitality experience in each of the Design Galleries it opened in 2017, RH Toronto and RH West Palm. RH plans to include an integrated hospitality experience in many of the Galleries that will open in fiscal 2018.

As of February 3, 2018, we operated a total of 83 retail Galleries consisting of 16 Design Galleries (10 next generation Design Galleries and 6 larger format Design Galleries), 47 legacy Galleries, 1 RH Modern Gallery and 4 RH Baby & Child Galleries throughout the United States and Canada, and 15 Waterworks Showrooms in the United States and in the U.K. The following list shows the number of retail Galleries and Showrooms in each U.S. state, each Canadian province and in the U.K. where we operate as of February 3, 2018:

Kansas | | 1 | | Oklahoma | | 1 | | London | 1 
Louisiana | | 1 | | Oregon | | 1 | | | 
Maryland | | 1 | | Pennsylvania | | 2 | | Total | 83

 
We continually analyze opportunities to selectively consolidate stores in connection with openings of our Design Galleries or close stores that have been under-performing or are no longer consistent with our brand positioning. In many cases, we continue to operate a store until its lease has expired in order to effect the closure in a cost-efficient manner.
 Outlet Stores 
 As of February 3, 2018, we operated 32 outlet stores in 19 states in the United States and Canada. Our outlet stores are branded as Restoration Hardware Outlet or RH Outlet and are typically located in large outlet malls. Our outlet stores serve as an efficient means to sell second quality, discontinued and overstock inventory outside of our core sales channels. In addition, we periodically hold warehouse and sample sales to liquidate inventory. These net revenues are included in our outlet channel.
 E-Commerce 
 Our primary RH websites, www.rh.com, www.restorationhardware.com, www.rhbabyandchild.com, www.rhteen.com and www.rhmodern.com, provide our customers with the ability to purchase our merchandise online. We sell Waterworks products online through www.waterworks.com.
 Our e-commerce platform allows our customers to experience the RH lifestyle reflected in our catalogs and throughout our stores, and to shop substantially all of our current product assortment. We update our websites regularly to reflect new products, product availability and occasionally special offers.
 The RH websites also offer room-based navigation, which allows the customer to envision and shop items by room or by product, expanding on the richness of the online experience. For example, customers can search our websites for products by size or color, browse through our extensive product categories and see detailed information about each item and collection, such as dimensions, materials and care instructions. Additionally, customers can select color swatches and view merchandise displayed with different color and fabric options. 
 Source Books 
 We produce a series of catalogs, which we refer to as Source Books, to showcase our merchandise assortment. In fiscal 2017, our mailed Source Books included Interiors, Outdoor, RH Modern, RH TEEN, RH Baby & Child and Holiday. Our Source Books are one of our primary branding and advertising vehicles. We have found that merchandise assortments displayed in our Source Books contribute to increased sales of those products across all of our channels. As in our retail stores, our Source Books present our merchandise in lifestyle settings that reflect our unique design aesthetic. Our Source Books also feature profiles of select artisan vendors and other compelling editorial content regarding home décor. All creative work on our Source Books is coordinated in-house in our RH Center of Innovation & Product Leadership, providing us greater control over the brand image presented to our customers, while also reducing our Source Book production costs.

Our Source Book mailings serve as a key driver of sales through both our websites and retail stores. Our customers respond to the Source Books across all of our channels, with sales trends closely correlating to the assortments that we emphasize and feature prominently both in our Source Books and in our stores. We continue to evaluate and optimize our Source Book strategy based on our experience.
 We maintain a database of customer information, including customer information from our RH Members Program, which includes sales patterns, detailed purchasing information, certain demographic information, geographic locations and mailing and email addresses. We mail our Source Books to addresses within this database and to addresses provided to us by third parties. The database supports our ability to analyze our customers’ buying behaviors across sales channels and facilitates the development of targeted marketing strategies, and is maintained in accordance with our privacy policy disclosed on our website. We segment our customer files based on multiple variables, and we tailor our Source Book mailings and emails in response to the purchasing patterns and product needs of our customers. We focus on continually improving the segmentation of customer files and the expansion of our customer database.
 Our Source Books, in concert with our e-commerce channel, are a cost-effective means of testing new products, and allow us to launch categories in a disciplined, expeditious and cost-effective manner. 
 Trade and Contract
 In addition to our core channels, we continue to expand into professional services channels, including Trade and Contract. In the Trade channel, we work directly with independent interior designers purchasing for their businesses. Separately, we sell directly to customers who make purchases with the assistance of their own interior designers or decorators, which we refer to as “designer-assisted sales.” Our Contract business services hospitality, real estate development and other business clients. These channels offer additional avenues for reaching new customers, including both businesses and individuals.
Phone Orders
 In addition to making purchases in our stores or online, customers, including those from our Trade and Contract businesses, can place orders over the phone by calling our customer service associates.
Marketing and Advertising 
 We employ a variety of marketing and advertising vehicles to drive customer traffic across all our channels, strengthen and reinforce our brand image and acquire new customers. These include targeted Source Book circulation, promotional mailings, email communications, online and print advertisements, and public relations activities and events. We maintain a database of customers, which includes sales patterns, detailed purchasing information, certain demographic information, geographic locations and mailing and email addresses. We use our customer database to tailor our programs and increase productivity of our marketing and promotion initiatives. We leverage our marketing and advertising expenses across all our channels as we seek to optimize the efficiency of our investment. 
 Our stores and our Source Books are the primary branding and advertising vehicles for the RH brands. The highly-differentiated design aesthetic and shopping environment of our stores drive customer traffic not only to our stores but also to our direct channels. Our Source Books and targeted emails further reinforce the RH brand image and drive sales across all of our sales channels. We also engage in a wide range of other marketing, promotional and public relations activities to promote our brands. These campaigns include media coverage in design, lifestyle, culture/society and specialty publications, as well as in-store events related to new store openings and product launches. We also engage print advertising in brand-relevant publications such as Architectural Digest, Elle Décor, Veranda, Town and Country, T Magazine, WSJ and others, and deliver marketing messages to customers via online advertising. We believe that these efforts will drive increased brand awareness, leading to higher sales in our stores and our direct business over time.
RH Members Program
 The RH Members Program is an exclusive membership program that reimagines and simplifies the shopping experience. For an annual fee, the RH Members Program provides a set discount every day across all RH brands in addition to other benefits including complimentary interior design services through the RH Interior Design program and eligibility for preferred financing plans on the RH Credit Card, among other benefits. We have introduced the RH Members Program as an alternative to prior practices involving numerous event-driven promotions, which has changed the promotional cadence of our business from historical norms. Our business has evolved from a product based business to a project based business. The RH Members Program allows our customers to shop for what they want, when they want, and receive the greatest value. We believe that our shift from a promotional event model to a membership model has enhanced the customer experience, rendered our brand more valuable, improved operational execution and reduced costs.

Sourcing 
 We primarily contract with third-party vendors for the manufacture of our merchandise. Our sourcing strategy focuses on identifying and using vendors that can provide the quality materials and fine craftsmanship that our customers expect of our brand. To ensure that our high standards of quality and timely delivery of merchandise are met, we work closely with vendors and manufacturers. Our products are generally made from readily available raw materials. We seek to ensure the consistent quality of our manufacturers’ products by selectively inspecting pre-production samples, conducting periodic site visits to certain of our vendors’ production facilities and selectively inspecting inbound shipments at our distribution facilities. In fiscal 2017, we sourced approximately 75% of our purchase dollar volume from approximately 26 vendors. In fiscal 2017, one vendor accounted for approximately 11% of our purchase dollar volume. Based on total dollar volume of purchases for fiscal 2017, approximately 77% of our products were sourced in Asia, the majority of which originated from China, 14% from the United States and the remainder from other regions.
 RH is committed to offering safe, legal, high quality products, made consistently with our values. RH has a Compliance and Social Responsibility team dedicated to ensuring we keep these commitments through product testing, audits and other verification methods. Product testing is a core process for our organization. RH Baby & Child has received GREENGUARD Gold Certification of nursery furniture, which demonstrates that these products are low-emitting, thus contributing to better indoor air quality. GREENGUARD Gold Certified products aid in the creation of healthier indoor environments, by emitting fewer airborne compounds that can contribute to health issues including asthma and other respiratory conditions. We are in the process of obtaining GREENGUARD Gold Certification for all of our furniture products.
 We believe that we generally have strong relationships with our product vendors. We have a limited number of long-term merchandise supply contracts. Although we transact business primarily on an order-by-order basis, we typically work with many of our vendors over extended periods of time, and many vendors are making long-term capacity investments to serve our increasing demands. 
 Distribution and Delivery
 We manage the distribution and delivery of our products through our distribution centers. We currently operate two furniture fulfillment centers and one small parcel fulfillment center servicing RH products, which are located strategically in three markets throughout the United States. We have one fulfillment center in the United States servicing Waterworks products.
 In fiscal 2017, we completed the closure of our furniture fulfillment centers in Los Angeles and Dallas. In total, we eliminated 1.75 million square feet of distribution center space, resulting in savings in excess of $20 million annually. Moving forward, we believe servicing our business from two coastal distribution centers will result in improved in-stock availability and significantly faster inventory turns. 
 We operate portions of our home delivery services in 11 key markets to leverage operating costs and improve our customers’ delivery experience, while reducing returns and damage to our products. We plan to continue to in-source these services in additional markets over time. We offer a white glove home delivery service for our larger merchandise and furniture categories, where third-party delivery personnel assist our customers by delivering fully assembled items to the location of their choice. We believe there is an opportunity to improve the customer experience by taking greater control of the home delivery experience over time. We believe that many third-party furniture delivery providers are designed to support mass and mid-market companies and that significant opportunity exists for developing improved solutions for the luxury market. We have achieved significant scale such that we can now explore and test alternative solutions in many markets, including the use of our own trucks and drivers, and believe we can dramatically enhance the customer experience while driving down return rates, damages, and deliveries per order. 
 Through expansions and upgrades to our warehousing, distribution and delivery operations, we have improved our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities, and have built a scalable infrastructure to support our future growth. We believe our enhanced supply chain and fulfillment operations allow us to manage customer orders and distribute merchandise to stores and customers in an efficient and cost-effective manner. We also believe that these upgrades have improved customer satisfaction by reducing delivery times, reducing damage to merchandise, and improving our customer’s overall buying experience.
 In fiscal 2017, we began architecting a new operating platform in order to simplify our business, enhance the customer experience, and amplify decision quality and speed. Our initial efforts focused on our distribution center network and the home delivery experience. As a result of our work to redesign our distribution network and optimize inventory, we were able to forego building a fifth furniture distribution center planned to open in fiscal 2017, and close two furniture distribution centers. We intend to continue to strengthen our supply chain operations through a number of key initiatives in fiscal 2018 as we work to design an operating platform that aligns with and amplifies our luxury positioning, inclusive of continued work on our distribution center network redesign, reverse logistics and outlet redesign, and the reconceptualization of home delivery.

Competition 
 The home furnishings industry is highly competitive. We primarily compete against a large number of independent retailers that provide unique items and custom-designed product offerings at high price points, including antique dealers and home furnishings retailers who market to the interior design community. We also compete with national and regional home furnishings retailers and department stores, as well as with mail order catalogs and online retailers focused on home furnishings.
 We believe we compete primarily on the basis of design, quality, value and customer service. We believe our distinct combination of design, quality and value allows us to compete effectively and we believe we differentiate ourselves from competitors based on the strength of our brand, products and our fully integrated multi-channel business model. We compete with the interior design trade and specialty merchants by providing a broader product assortment at an exceptional value based both upon the price and quality of our products. We compete against certain other home furnishings retailers primarily by offering what we believe are superior quality, highly distinctive design styles and a sophisticated lifestyle presentation in our product offering.
 We also believe that our success depends in substantial part on our ability to originate and define product trends, as well as to timely anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. However, many smaller specialty retailers may lack the financial resources, infrastructure, scale and national brand identity necessary to compete effectively with us. We believe we are effectively positioned between these two market segments to gain market share and drive growth.
 Employees
 As of February 3, 2018, we had approximately 5,200 employees, of which approximately 900 were part-time employees. As of that date, approximately 2,200 of our employees were based in our stores. None of our employees are represented by a union, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 
Intellectual Property 
 The “RH,” “Restoration Hardware,” “RH Baby & Child,” “RH Modern,” “RH TEEN,” “Waterworks,” and “Waterworks Studio” trademarks, among others, are registered or are the subject of pending trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the trademark registries of several foreign countries. Each of our trademark registrations is perpetually renewable provided that we use or continue to use the trademarks in commerce in the particular geographic market and for the goods or services covered by the registration. In addition, we own many domain names, including “restorationhardware.com,” “rh.com,” “rhbabyandchild.com,” “rhmodern.com,” “rhteen.com,” and “waterworks.com” and others that include our trademarks. These domain names are perpetually renewable. We own design patents or pending applications to protect the ornamental appearance of several of our products. These design patents are valid for 14 years from the date of issuance. We own copyrights, including copyright registrations or pending applications, for our website and for several of our Source Books. We believe that our trademarks, design patents, and copyrights have significant value and we will vigorously protect them against infringement. 
Fluctuation in Quarterly Results
 Our quarterly results have historically varied depending upon a variety of factors, including our product offerings, promotional events, store openings, shifts in the timing of holidays and the timing of Source Book releases, the timing and extent of our realization of the costs and benefits of our numerous strategic initiatives, among other things. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements and demands on our product distribution and delivery network may fluctuate during the year. Unique factors in any given quarter may affect period-to-period comparisons between the quarters being compared, and the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year. In addition, the introduction of the RH Members Program may influence the seasonality of our business, which previously fluctuated based on the timing of our promotional events.
Regulation and Legislation 
 We are subject to numerous regulations, including labor and employment laws, customs, laws governing truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, privacy, safety, real estate, environmental and zoning and occupancy laws, and other laws and regulations that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of our Galleries, outlets and warehouse facilities, in the United States, Canada and the U.K., as well as in jurisdictions from which we source our products. We believe we are in material compliance with laws applicable to our business.
