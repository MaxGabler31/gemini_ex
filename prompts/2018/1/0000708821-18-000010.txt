Competition
POS software and hardware offerings to the restaurant and retail markets is highly competitive. Most of our significant customers have several approved suppliers of software and/or hardware similar to one or more of our products. We compete directly with some product offerings from Oracle Corporation, NCR Corporation, and Panasonic Corporation among others. We compete on the basis of product delivery (cloud-based v. traditional on-premises software applications), existing and planned product design, features and functionality, software application and integration capabilities, quality and reliability, product development capabilities, price, and customer service. Our competitive advantages include our integrated solutions offerings, including our cloud (SaaS delivery model) and on-premise software, ergonomic purpose-built hardware, advanced development capabilities, extensive domain knowledge and expertise, excellent product reliability, a customer dedicated direct sales force organization, and world class and responsive customer service and support. The food safety and workforce efficiency market is an expanding and evolving market. As relevant technologies evolve and customer demands and expectations increase and mature, so do the competitive pressures in the market, with new companies entering and existing companies expanding their product and service portfolios. SureCheck competes for customers on the same basis as our POS solution. As to many of our product and service offerings, we face competition from companies who have access to significantly more financial and technical resources than we possess. 
Research and Development
Continuous product research, innovation, and product development are an integral part of our business. We continuously evaluate customer needs, and new and relevant technologies, to enable us to develop innovative products together with enhancements to our existing products that improve and/or add to their functionality, performance, operation, and integration capabilities; from leveraging the latest innovations in cloud computing to hand-held wireless devices to advances in internet performance, our professional services unit is available for consultation on a wide variety of topics including network infrastructures, system functionality, operating system platforms, and hardware expandability. Research and development expenses were $13.8 million in 2017 and $11.6 million in 2016. We capitalize certain software costs in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic No. 985 and in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 350. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Identifiable intangible assets - of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report) for further discussion.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We assemble our ES 8000 series internally in the U.S., and we source other hardware products and related components from third parties. Although we purchase most of the materials, supplies, product sub-assemblies and full assemblies for our internal assembling from several suppliers, we do rely on sole sources for certain of our assembly components and hardware products. As a result, we periodically review and evaluate potential risks of disruption to our supply chain operations in the event one or more supplier should fail to perform.
Government Segment:
PAR’s Government segment provides a range of solutions and services for the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) and federal agencies. It is focused on two principal offerings - Solutions and Services and Mission Support.
Solutions and Services
Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (“ISR”). We provide a variety of geospatial intelligence and situational awareness solutions for mobile and data center offerings. Our substantive, in depth expertise in these domains enables us to provide our government customers and large systems integrators with key technologies to support a variety of applications ranging from strategic enterprise systems to tactical in the field dismounted users. Additionally, we have developed a number of solutions relative to these advanced technologies and we provide integration and training support with respect to these solutions.
ISR provides systems engineering support and software-based solutions to DoD research and development laboratories as well as operational commands. Our internal expertise ranges from theoretical and experimental studies to development and fielding of operational capabilities. Our employees are:
▪experienced developers and subject-matter experts in DoD Full Motion Video (“FMV”);

We are actively engaged in the development of mobility applications that support the needs of mobile teams with real-time situation awareness and distributed communications. ISR has a strong legacy in the advanced research, development and productization of geospatial information assurance (“GIA”) technology involving steganography, steg analysis, digital watermarking, and image forensics. These enabling technologies have been used to provide increased protection and security of geospatial data. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance also provides scientific and technical support to the U.S. Intelligence Community.
Systems Engineering & Evaluation. We integrate and test a broad range of government and industry research and development solutions. The Company designs, integrates and operates antenna data collection solutions for experimentation, demonstration, and test support. We also provide technical engineering and analysis services to intelligence community customers, supporting development and deployment of advanced prototypes and quick reaction systems.
Mission Support
Satellite & Telecommunications Support. We provide a wide range of technical and support services to sustain mission critical components of the Department of Defense Information Network (DoDIN). These services include continuous 24/7/365 operations, system enhancements and associated maintenance of very low frequency (VLF), high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) ground-based radio transmitter/receiver facilities. Additionally, the Company operates and maintains several extremely high frequency (EHF) and super high frequency (SHF) satellite communication earth terminals and teleport facilities. The DoD communications earth stations operated by PAR is the primary communications infrastructure utilized by the national command authority and military services to exercise command and control of the nation’s air, land and naval forces and provide support to allied coalition forces.
Space & Satellite Control Support. We provide 24/7/365 satellite telemetry, tracking, and control services in support of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) operations. Our experience includes mission planning, launch and early orbit (L&EO) rehearsals and support, COOP exercises and operations, ground systems sustainment, and watch and on-console operations for anomaly response, notification, resolution and process improvement for FLTSAT, UHF Follow-On, Polar EHF, and MUOS satellite constellations.  
Management technology/Systems Support. We provide management technology services to the DoD and federal agencies. These services include helpdesk services, systems administration, network administration, information assurance and systems security, database administration, telephone systems management, testing and testbed management, and ITIL-based service management.
Telecommunication services include satellite and terrestrial communications operations and maintenance services, which operate elements of the DoDIN to support the National Command Authority (President & Joint Chiefs of Staff), DoD and other government agencies. The Company provides IT support services ranging from advanced systems management to help desk support-with more than 50% of its global footprint outside the continental U.S. with contracts in Europe, Africa, Australia, and U.S. commonwealths and territories in the Pacific and Caribbean.
PAR has strong and enduring relationships with a diverse set of customers throughout the U.S. DoD and federal government, and our track record of delivering mission critical services to its government customers spans decades, and includes contracts continuing 15 years or more. We work closely with our customers, with the vast majority of our mission system employees co- located at customer sites. Our strong relationships and on-site presence with our customers enable PAR to develop substantive customer and technical domain knowledge, and translate mission understanding into exemplary program execution and continued demand for PAR’s services.
Marketing and Competition
We obtain contracts primarily through competitive proposals in response to solicitations from government organizations and prime contractors. In addition, PAR sometimes obtains contracts by submitting unsolicited proposals. Although we believe we are well positioned in our business areas, competition for government contracts is intense. Many of our competitors are major corporations, or subsidiaries thereof, that are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial resources. We also compete with many smaller, economically disadvantaged companies, many of which are designated by the government for preferential “set aside” treatment, that target segments of the government contract market. The principal competitive factors are past performance, the ability to perform the statement of work, price, technological capabilities, management capabilities and service. Many of our department of defense customers are migrating to low-price/technically acceptable procurements while leveraging commercial software standards, applications, and solutions.
