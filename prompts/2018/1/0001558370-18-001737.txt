 Item 1. Business
 Our Formation
 We were incorporated in Delaware on May 21, 2014 and were formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, one or more businesses or entities. On July 24, 2017, one of our subsidiaries merged with and into NextDecade LLC, a liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) development company founded in 2010 to develop LNG export projects and associated pipelines in the State of Texas.  Prior to the merger with NextDecade LLC, we had no operations and our assets consisted of cash proceeds received in connection with our initial public offering.
 Our first proposed LNG export facility, the Project, is well-positioned among the second wave of United States (“U.S”) LNG projects.  We have undertaken and continue to undertake various initiatives to evaluate, design and engineer the Project that we expect will result in demand for contracted capacity at the Terminal, which will allow us to seek construction financing to develop the Project.
 Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “NEXT.”
 As a result of our failure to satisfy the initial listing requirements of Nasdaq with respect to our warrants, on February 22, 2018, our warrants were delisted from trading on Nasdaq and began trading on the OTC Pink Market under the symbol “NEXTW.”
 Company Overview
 Our management is comprised of a team of industry leaders with extensive experience in LNG marketing and project development.  We have focused and continue to focus our development activities on the Project.   We believe the Project possesses competitive advantages in several important areas, including, engineering, commercial, regulatory, and gas supply. We submitted a pre-filing request for the Project to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) in March 2015 and filed a formal application with the FERC in May 2016. We also believe we have robust commercial offtake and gas supply strategies in place and we estimate that the Project will commence commercial operations as early as 2023.
 We believe that the Terminal, located on a 984-acre site in Brownsville, Texas, along with the Pipeline connecting the Terminal to the Agua Dulce market area, is well-positioned among the second wave of U.S. LNG projects. The Terminal is engineered to have liquefaction capacity of 27 million tons of LNG per annum (“mtpa”). It is located to take advantage of gas reserves in West and South Texas, benefiting from recent discoveries in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. We plan to own, develop, and operate the Project. We have an exclusive option for a long-term lease with the Port of Brownsville for the Terminal site through November 5, 2019.
 The Project will include up to six liquefaction trains (each with a nominal capacity of at least 4.5 mtpa/train), four LNG storage tanks (each with a capacity of 180,000 cubic meters), two marine jetties for ocean-going LNG vessels, one turning basin, and six truck loading bays for LNG and natural gas liquids. The Pipeline is expected to be comprised of twin, 137-mile-long, 42-inch-outside diameter, natural gas pipelines, three 180,000-horsepower compressor stations, two 30,000-horsepower interconnect booster stations, six mainline valve sites, four metering sites, and various ancillary facilities. The twin pipelines are expected to be rated to a maximum allowable operating pressure of 1,480 pounds per square inch and total deliverability of at least 4.5 Bcf/d. We are exploring design enhancements to increase throughput capacity for the Project.
 We have leased a second 994-acre site on the Houston Ship Channel in Texas City for an expected two or three trains with at least 13.5 mtpa capacity (the “Galveston Bay Terminal”). We intend to use similar design and engineering as the Terminal as we retain rights to the design specifications and intellectual property associated with the Terminal.

 Capital Cost, Liquefaction Technology, and Engineering
 Our expected engineering, procurement, and construction (“EPC”) contractor, CB&I LLC (“CB&I), has vast experience in the LNG industry. CB&I is one of the world’s premier EPC firms, specializing in oil and gas infrastructure projects. Founded in 1889, CB&I has been involved with LNG projects for more than 50 years, including construction of the first double-walled storage tank (1958) and the first marine distribution terminal (1970). Additionally, CB&I has an extraordinary record with workplace safety; CB&I won the National Safety Council’s Green Cross for Safety in 2015.
 Based on the progress of its detailed engineering and cost optimization exercises to date, in conjunction with CB&I’s own work with Baker Hughes, a GE Company (the Terminal’s primary rotating equipment provider), we estimate construction costs for the first three liquefaction trains of the Terminal of $490/ton before owners’ costs, financing costs, and contingencies, with a target EPC cost reduction to $450/ton. Our FERC applications contemplate the Terminal’s entire six trains of production.  We anticipate taking a positive final investment decision (“FID”) on the first phase of the Project with three trains at the Terminal, though we can take an initial positive FID on as few as two trains. 
 CB&I has conducted front end engineering and design (“FEED”) work on behalf of numerous LNG export projects globally and served as EPC contractor for Peru LNG, which commenced operations in 2010 and has successfully delivered more than 430 cargoes, as well as two LNG export projects currently under construction in the U.S. (the Cameron and Freeport projects). The Terminal is of substantially similar design to the Peru LNG project that CB&I completed several years ago. During the construction of Peru LNG, CB&I experienced a lost time incident rate of only 0.01 and successfully trained and hired thousands of local workers. Additionally, hundreds of workers from the Rio Grande Valley have been hired and trained by CB&I in recent years to work on other U.S. LNG project developments in Texas and Louisiana. We believe a well-trained workforce will be prepared to return to the Rio Grande Valley upon successful completion of those projects.
 We have selected Air Products’ C3MR™ liquefaction technology, which is used in a wide array of LNG projects around the world, including in several LNG projects under construction in the U.S. With global expertise in LNG EPC projects, CB&I performed our FEED work for the Terminal. We are currently progressing design, regulatory, engineering, and commercial activities.  We are finalizing detailed negotiations for a lump-sum turnkey (“LSTK”) EPC contract that includes performance, time, and cost guarantees, and we expect to execute the LSTK EPC contract in the second quarter of 2018. We believe that the combination of proven technology with one of the foremost LNG EPC contractors significantly mitigates design, construction, and execution risk and is expected to be viewed favorably by prospective customers and to facilitate attractively priced project financing.
 Commercial
 We are continuing commercial discussions with a variety of other parties ranging from large utilities and state-sponsored enterprises to portfolio and multinational commodity interests and expect to sign long-term binding offtake commitments prior to FID, leveraging the global relationships and extensive experience of our management team.
 We believe our project locations will provide customers with access to low-cost natural gas from the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. Importantly, we have offered customers a choice of flexible offtake contracting models such as tolling, free on board or delivered ex-ship. 
 We believe traditional LNG buyers are seeking to diversify away from oil-linked contracts and are looking to increase destination flexibility. As a result, low-cost U.S. LNG is poised to capture market share, supported by the country’s abundant gas supply, existing pipeline infrastructure, political stability, and a competitive project execution environment.
 Regulatory
 We filed our formal application with the FERC on May 5, 2016 and expect to receive a Draft Environmental Impact Statement from the FERC as early as the second quarter of 2018.  Final authorization of the Terminal under Section 3(a) of the Natural Gas Act, and of the Pipeline under Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, is expected as early as the end of 2018. On September 7, 2016, we received authorization from the U.S. Department of Energy (the “DOE”) to export LNG to FTA countries on our own behalf and as agent for others, for a term of 30 years. A non-FTA authorization is expected shortly after completion of the FERC National Environmental Policy Act review process.

 Gas Supply
 The Terminal is located in Brownsville, Texas, benefiting from access to the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. We expect to realize material benefits from providing our customers with access to these low-cost associated gas resources in Texas.  Independent shale producers have created extraordinary efficiencies and improvements, including enhanced well recoveries through extended lateral lengths and hydraulic fracturing technology, rig productivity, and operating and lifecycle costs. However, U.S. demand has not risen proportionally with the growth in recoverable reserves.
 For example, whereas U.S. demand for natural gas has generally increased modestly year-over-year over the past few decades, the level of new discoveries and production has been remarkable.  U.S. domestic demand for natural gas has increased from approximately 20 Tcf per year in 1980 to approximately 27 Tcf in 2015, a 35 percent increase.  However, proved reserves of natural gas have increased by approximately 200 Tcf over the same period, a 100 percent increase. Due to technological advancements, almost all U.S. reserve basins are able to produce gas for a break-even cost of less than $3.00/MMBtu, which is less than the approximate price implied by gas forward curves for at least the next ten years.
 The development of the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale figures in the strategic importance of the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. In 2010, Marcellus production totaled approximately 2 Bcf/d; by the end of 2017, this number exceeded 23.7 Bcf/d. Currently, Marcellus production is greater than any individual country in the world except for Russia. This has caused the northeast to swing from an importer of natural gas (8 Bcf/d in 2010) to an exporter (-3.7 Bcf/d in 2017). There is more than 13 Bcf/d of northeast pipeline capacity scheduled to enter service during 2018 and Marcellus and Utica producers remain focused on moving volumes to more favorable Gulf Coast markets.  This indicates that Texas production is increasingly less likely to flow towards northeast markets and expected to be consumed in or exported from the southwest or Gulf of Mexico regions.
 The Permian Basin is expected to produce large quantities of associated gas, the production of which occurs as a byproduct with oil production. The State of Texas severely restricts the flaring of natural gas, so infrastructure will be required to transport this associated gas to Gulf Coast markets economically. In the fall of 2017, KinderMorgan announced it had enough binding customer commitments to proceed with the development of its Gulf Coast Express (“GCX”) project.  The GCX project will move gas from the Waha area in the Permian Basin to Agua Dulce, Texas where the Project expects to receive gas supply.  The GCX project is expected to have an estimated capacity of 1.9 Bcf/d and is expected to be in service by October 2019.  This new high-pressure pipeline will provide a much needed exit strategy for incremental Permian gas supplies.  Due to the production economics for the primary resource (oil), many Permian producers are expected to face sub-zero breakeven prices with respect to the price of the associated gas — in other words, producers should be able to economically produce oil even if they have to pay someone to take the gas. We believe that the scope for incremental domestic gas demand may be limited, making large, stable sources of gas demand, such as the Terminal, highly attractive to gas producers.
 The Permian Basin is approaching its 100th year of oil production.  At present, production has reached a record 2.9 million barrels per day (MBPD), making it the world’s second-most-prolific field, behind the formidable Ghawar in Saudi Arabia.  The Texas side of the Permian Basin (excluding the portion underneath New Mexico) has already produced 30 billion barrels of crude and 75 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural gas.  Since 2012, Permian Basin production has increased by nearly 2 MBPD, which is a larger increase than any other oilfield in the world.  The natural gas production volumes associated with this oil have been just as impressive.  According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2018 natural gas production in the Permian Basin is expected to rise to more than 9.2 MMcf/d from May 2016 levels of approximately 6.9 MMcf/d. Current oil production in the Permian has risen to more than 2.9 MBPD from 1.9 MBPD in May 2016. These comprise 33.0% and 53.0% increases, respectively, and both capital spending and production are expected to continue rising precipitously in the coming years. Significant gas production relative to anticipated takeaway capacity constraints (despite expected capacity growth), could lead to negative basis to Henry Hub that could benefit our projects relative to other second-wave U.S. LNG projects.
 We believe that the Pipeline, projected to have at least eight interconnects with a combined 6.7 Bcf/d of receipt capacity, will have supply flexibility and be price competitive. Eastward takeaway capacity from the Permian is already expanding in the region, with high-profile plans over the next 12 to 18 months among key sponsors such as KinderMorgan, NAmerico and others. The combination of increased production and expanding takeaway capacity indicates that the Agua Dulce hub, from which the Pipeline is proposed to be routed, is expected to become increasingly liquid and remain competitively priced to Henry Hub. We believe our proximity to two major gas reserves basins, increasing takeaway capacity in the area, a significant influx of investment over the last 12 to 18 months, as well as our existing contacts and

discussions with some of the largest regional operators, represent key elements of a compelling feedgas strategy for partners and customers alike. We are continuing to advance substantive negotiations in these areas.
