ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
ENGlobal Corporation (which may be referred to as “ENGlobal,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), incorporated in the State of Nevada in June 1994, is a leading provider of engineering and professional services principally to the energy industry. All of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relates to the annual periods ended December 30, 2017, which contained 52 weeks, and December 31, 2016, which contained 53 weeks. We have historically positioned ourselves as a leading, reliable, high quality service provider of automation engineering and integration services, multi-discipline engineering services and engineered solutions to our customers primarily in the energy industry.
 
We derive revenues primarily from three sources: (1) business development efforts, (2) preferred provider or alliance agreements with strategic clients, and (3) referrals from existing customers and industry members. Our Senior Vice President of Business Development collaborates with our operations managers and in-house business development professionals assigned to clients and territories within the United States. Client relationships are nurtured by our geographic advantage of having office locations near our larger customers. By having clients in close proximity, we are able to provide single, dedicated points of contact. Our growth depends in large measure on our ability to attract and retain qualified business development personnel with a respected reputation in the energy industry. Management believes that in-house marketing allows for more accountability and control, thus increasing profitability.
 
We generally enter into two principal types of contracts with our clients: time-and-material contracts and fixed-price contracts. Our clients typically determine the type of contract to be utilized for a particular engagement, with the specific terms and conditions of a contract resulting from a negotiation process between us and our client.

Our business development focuses on building long-term relationships with customers and clients in order to provide solutions throughout the life-cycle of their facilities. Additionally, we seek to capitalize on cross-selling opportunities between our Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (“EPCM”) and Automation segments. Sales leads are often jointly developed and pursued by our business development personnel from both of these segments.
 
Products and services are also promoted through trade advertising, participation in industry conferences and on-line Internet communication via our corporate home page at www.englobal.com. The ENGlobal website provides information about our operating segments and illustrates our Company’s full range of services and capabilities. We use internal and external resources to maintain and update our website on an ongoing basis. Through the ENGlobal website, we seek to provide visitors and investors with a single point of contact for obtaining information about our company. We develop preferred provider and alliance agreements with clients in order to facilitate repeat business. These preferred provider agreements, also known as master services or umbrella agreements (“MSA”) typically have a duration of multiple years. This allows our clients to release work to us without having to negotiate contract terms for each project released. Although the MSA is not a guarantee for work under a certain project, ENGlobal generally offers a slightly reduced billing structure to clients willing to commit to arrangements that are expected to provide a steady stream of work. With the terms of the contract settled, add-on projects with these customers are easier to negotiate and can be accepted quickly, without the necessity of a bidding process. Management believes that these agreements can serve to stabilize project-centered operations.
 
During 2016, we expanded our capabilities and refocused our business to provide engineered, repeatable and modularized solutions for our clients. To that end, we made several strategic hires in the key areas of business development and project management and we opened a fabrication facility to accommodate the expected additional project scope. With this addition, we are vertically integrated from engineering and design to fabrication and integration. During 2017, management engaged a strategy consulting firm to assess the company’s strengths and market trends in connection with management updating the Company’s long term business growth strategy. The assessment identified an intersection between increasing market trends in the areas of industrial automation and Industrial Internet of Things (“IIOT”) and the Company’s experience in these areas. As a result, we have started a multi-year strategic initiative to significantly strengthen our Automation capabilities in the areas of distributed control systems design and replacement, advanced data capture design, human machine interface design, machine learning, cyber security, and artificial intelligence. We initiated the implementation of this initiative by aligning our internal Automation segment reporting structure and our business development focus. We are now focusing our efforts on selling our core EPCM and Automation businesses capabilities, processes and infrastructure to current and future clients, positioning ourselves to take advantage of these growth opportunities as they are presented, both organic and external, and which may be outside of the energy industry.
 
One result of our positioning is that our proposal pipeline continues to increase both for our EPCM and Automation services. Many of these proposals have not been awarded and have exceeded our expected award timing, which would imply that many of our customers will release awards when they are more comfortable that commodity prices have stabilized at a sufficient level. Backlog represents an estimate of gross revenues of all awarded contracts that have not been completed and will be recognized as revenue over the life of the project. Although backlog reflects business that we consider to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur. Further, most contracts with clients may be terminated by either party at will, in which case the client would only be obligated to pay us for services provided through the termination date. A significant portion of our revenue is generated through MSAs with our clients. Projects awarded under these MSAs tend to be smaller in nature, but continuously awarded as each one is completed. In these instances, only the current unfinished projects are included in our backlog. Additionally, we have historically performed work under longer term contracts with the U.S. Navy that were generally renewed, released or awarded on an annual basis. Recently, the federal government has begun changing the contracting agency for this work. This has created some disruption to the contracting sequence and may have caused some decline in the year over year comparison of backlog. At December 30, 2017, our backlog was $24.1 million. Of this, $16.8 million was for Automation and $7.3 million was for EPCM. This compares to a total backlog of $36.7 million as of December 31, 2016 with $9.0 million for EPCM and $27.7 million for Automation, which included $8.0 million of backlog for the Caspian Pipeline project that was completed during 2017.
 
We continue to be mindful of our overhead structure. While we have made investments in key individuals, product developments and new facilities and equipment, which all have negatively impacted our SG&A, we have been able to offset those increases with decreases in other areas and, overall, our SG&A costs have continued to decrease. We recognize that the level of our SG&A is greater than it could be for a company our size; however, we have maintained our overhead structure in anticipation of higher revenue levels.
 
As a result of these steps, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the anticipated increase in demand as the energy markets rebound. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Reporting Segments
 
Our segments are strategic business units that offer different services and products and therefore require different marketing and management strategies. During 2017, ENGlobal changed the reporting structure within the Company by placing an operational leader in charge of its engineering offices and a separate operational leader in charge of its automation offices, including the office that contracts with government agencies. The operating performance is regularly reviewed with these two operational leaders, the chief executive officer (“CEO”), the chief financial officer (“CFO”) and others. This group represents the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for ENGlobal.
 
We have revised our segment reporting to reflect our current management approach and recast prior periods to conform to the current segment presentation. Our corporate and other expenses that do not individually meet the criteria for segment reporting continue to be reported separately as Corporate expenses.
 
Products and Services
 
The EPCM segment provides multi-disciplined engineering services relating to the development, management and execution of projects requiring professional engineering and related project management services primarily to the energy industry throughout the United States. Our EPCM segment offers feasibility studies, engineering, design, procurement, and construction management. The EPCM segment currently operates through ENGlobal’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ENGlobal U.S., Inc. (“ENGlobal U.S.”). The EPCM segment offers a wide range of services as a single source provider for project delivery. ENGlobal’s engineering staff has the capability of developing a project from the initial planning stages through detailed design and construction management. Our services include conceptual studies, project definition, cost estimating, engineering design, environmental compliance, material procurement, project management and construction management.
 
The EPCM segment derives revenue primarily on contracts from time-and-material fees charged for professional and technical services. Its operating income is derived primarily from services it provides to the oil and gas industry. This segment sometimes enters into contracts providing for the execution of projects on a fixed-price basis, whereby some, or all, of the project activities related to engineering, material procurement and construction management are performed for a fixed amount.
 
The Automation segment provides services related to the design, integration and implementation of process distributed control and analyzer systems, advanced automated data gathering systems and information technology primarily to the energy industry throughout the United States and to the U.S. Government globally. This segment also designs, assembles, integrates and services control and instrumentation systems for specific applications in the energy and processing related industries. The Automation segment operates through ENGlobal’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, ENGlobal U.S. and ENGlobal Government Services, Inc. (“EGS”). These services are offered to clients in the petroleum refining, petrochemical, pipeline, production, process and pulp and paper industries.
 
EGS primarily provides automated fuel handling systems and maintenance services to branches of the U.S. military and public sector entities. Other clients of this division are government agencies, refineries, petrochemical and process industry customers worldwide. EGS provides electrical and instrument installation, technical services, and ongoing maintenance, calibration and repair services.

Competition
 
Our EPCM segment competes with a large number of public and private firms of various sizes, ranging from the industry’s largest firms, which operate on a worldwide basis to much smaller regional and local firms. Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have significantly greater financial and other resources available to them than we do. However, the largest firms in our industry are sometimes our clients, performing as program managers for very large scale projects who subcontract a portion of their work to us. We also have many competitors who are smaller than us and who, as a result, may be able to offer services at more competitive prices.
 
Competition is centered on performance and the ability to provide the engineering, planning and project delivery skills required for completing projects in a timely, cost-efficient manner. The expertise of our management and technical personnel and the timeliness and quality of our support services are key competitive factors.

Customers
 
Our customer base consists primarily of Fortune 500 companies in the energy industry. While we do not have continuing dependence on any single client or a limited group of clients, one or a few clients may contribute a substantial portion of our revenue in any given year or over a period of several consecutive years due to the longevity of major projects, such as facility upgrades or expansions. ENGlobal may work for many different subsidiaries or divisions of a client. The loss of a single large customer, including all of its subsidiaries or divisions, or the reduction in demand for our services by several customers in the same year could have a material impact on our financial results. We continue to focus substantial attention on improving customer services in order to enhance satisfaction and increase customer retention. Revenue generated through sources such as preferred provider relationships are longer-term in nature and are not typically limited to one project.
 
A significant long-term trend among our clients and their industry counterparts has been outsourcing engineering services. This trend has fostered the development of ongoing, longer-term client arrangements. These arrangements vary in scope, duration and degree of commitment. While there is typically no guarantee that work will result from these agreements, often the arrangements form the basis for a longer-term client relationship. Despite their variety, we believe that these partnering relationships have a stabilizing influence on our revenue.
 
Overall, our ten largest customers, who vary from one period to the next, accounted for 75.5% of our total revenues for 2017 and 73.4% of our total revenues for 2016. Most of our projects are specific in nature and we generally have multiple projects with the same clients. If we were to lose one or more of our significant clients and were unable to replace them with other customers or other projects, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our top two clients in 2017 were the U.S. Government and a leading provider of technology and infrastructure for the energy industry. Even though we frequently receive work from repeat clients, our client list may vary significantly from year to year. Our potential revenue in all segments is dependent on continuing relationships with our customers. For the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had approximately 84 and 104 active customers, respectively.
 
Suppliers
 
Our ability to provide clients with services and systems in a timely and competitive manner depends on the availability of products and parts from our suppliers at competitive prices and on reasonable terms. Our suppliers are not obligated to have products on hand for timely delivery nor can they guarantee product availability in sufficient quantities to meet our demands. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary supplies at prices or on terms we find acceptable. However, in an effort to maximize availability and maintain quality control, we generally procure components from multiple distributors on our clients’ behalf and in some cases we can take advantage of national agreements our clients may have entered into.
 
For example, all of the product components used by our Automation segment are assembled using components and materials that are available from numerous domestic manufacturers and suppliers. There are approximately five principal suppliers of distributed control systems, each of which can be replaced by an equally viable competitor, and our clients typically direct the selection of their preferred supplier. Thus, in the vast majority of cases, we anticipate little or no difficulty in obtaining components in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner to support our installation and assembly operations in the Automation segment. Units produced through the Automation segment are not produced for inventory and component parts; rather, they are typically purchased on an as-needed basis. By being vendor neutral, ENGlobal is able to provide quality technology and platforms for the design of plant systems such as 3D modeling, process simulation and other technical applications.

Despite the foregoing, our Automation segment relies on certain suppliers for necessary components and there can be no assurance that these components will continue to be available on acceptable terms. If a vendor does not continue to contract with us, it may be difficult to obtain alternative sources of supply without a material disruption in our ability to provide products and services to our customers. While we do not believe that such a disruption is likely, if it did occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses
 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology, which we do primarily through protection of our trade secrets and confidentiality agreements. In addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued our “Integrated Rack” patent No. 7,419,061 B1 in 2008, our “Universal Master Control Station System” patent No. 8,601,491 B1 in 2013, our “Modular HVAC System for Providing Positive Pressure to an Interior of a Positive Pressure Facility” patent No. 8,670,870 in 2014, our “Method of Controlling a Plurality of Master Control Stations” patent No. 8,959,447 B1 and our “Client Configuration Tool” patent No. 8,983,636 B1 in 2015.
 
Our trade names are protected by registration as well as by common law trademark rights. Our trademark for the use of “ENGlobal” ® - “Engineered for Growth” ®, and “viMAC” ® in connection with our products are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and we claim common law trademark rights for “ENGlobal” TM in connection with our services. We also claim common law trademark rights for “Global Thinking…Global Solutions” TM , “CARES - Communicating Appropriate Responses in Emergency Situations” TM, “riFAT” TM, “ACE” TM, and “ENGlobal Power Islands” TM .
 
There can be no assurance that the protective measures we currently employ will be adequate to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of our technology, or the independent third party development of the same or similar technology. Although our competitive position to some extent depends on our ability to protect our proprietary and trade secret information, we believe that other factors, such as the technical expertise and knowledge base of our management and technical personnel, as well as the timeliness and quality of the support services we provide, will also help us to maintain our competitive position.
 
Employees
 
As of December 30, 2017, we employed approximately 252 individuals on a full-time equivalent basis compared to approximately 279 individuals on a full-time equivalent basis as of December 31, 2016. The 10% decrease in personnel in 2017 was primarily attributable to the attrition of employees as upstream oil and gas industry projects were canceled and the awards for new projects declined overall. We believe that our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled and experienced professional and technical personnel has been and will continue to be critical to our ability to execute our business plan. While the overall number of employees has declined, during 2016 and 2017 we strategically hired several talented, experienced individuals with significant relationships with our current and new customers to expand our product offerings to our existing customers and to gain market share. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
Government Regulations
 
ENGlobal and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to our business and operations, and various health and safety regulations established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). We are subject to a variety of state, local and foreign licensing, registration and other regulatory requirements governing the practice of engineering and other professional disciplines. For example, OSHA requires Process Safety Management to prevent the release of hazardous chemicals, the Department of Transportation (DOT) requires that pipeline operators are in full compliance with pipeline safety regulations, and the Environmental and Protection Agency (EPA) provides incentives to reduce chemical emissions. Currently, we are not aware of any situation or condition relating to the regulation of the Company, its subsidiaries, or personnel that we believe is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
Benefit Plans
 
ENGlobal sponsors a 401(k) retirement plan for its employees. The Company, at the direction of the Board of Directors, may make discretionary contributions. Our employees may elect to make contributions pursuant to a salary reduction agreement upon meeting age and length-of-service requirements. For active participants, we match 33.3% of elective deferrals up to 6%, for a maximum of 2% of an employee’s compensation. We have made contributions totaling $0.3 million to the plan for each of the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
