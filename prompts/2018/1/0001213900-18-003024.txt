Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation in May 2015 and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination, with one or more businesses. We have generated no operating revenues to date, and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination.
 
We have concentrated our efforts in identifying businesses which provide disruptive technological innovation to the financial services industry, with particular emphasis on businesses that provide data processing; transactional and data security; rewards, loyalty, and consumer engagement platforms by which financial services engage their clients and market and provide services to them; digital marketing; and payment processing services. We have sought to acquire established businesses that we believe are fundamentally sound but potentially in need of financial, operational, strategic or managerial redirection to maximize value.
 
At December 31, 2017, we had not yet commenced operations. All activity through December 31, 2017 relates to the Company’s formation and its initial public offering, and identifying a target company for our initial business combination.
 
The registration statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on January 19, 2017. On January 25, 2017, we consummated the initial public offering of 17,500,000 units generating gross proceeds of $175,000,000.  
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 420,000 placement units at a price of $10.00 per unit in a private placement to our sponsor, FinTech Investors Holding II, LLC, and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., the representative of the underwriters for the initial public offering, generating gross proceeds of $4,200,000.  
 
Following the closing of the initial public offering on January 25, 2017, an amount of $175,000,000 ($10.00 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the initial public offering and the placement units was placed in a trust account and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination within 24 months from the consummation of the initial public offering; or (iii) the distribution of the trust account, if we are unable to complete a business combination within the combination period or upon any earlier liquidation of us. 
 
The Merger Agreement
 
On December 19, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among us, FinTech II Merger Sub Inc., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of us (“Merger Sub 1”), FinTech II Merger Sub 2 LLC, a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of us (“Merger Sub 2” and together with Merger Sub 1, the “Merger Subs”), Intermex Holdings II, Inc. (“Intermex”) and SPC Intermex Representative LLC (the “Representative”), which provides for the acquisition of Intermex by us pursuant to the proposed merger of Merger Sub 1 with and into Intermex with Intermex continuing as the initial surviving entity (the “First Merger”), immediately following which the initial surviving entity will be merged (the “Second Merger,” and together with the First Merger, the “Merger”) with and into Merger Sub 2, with Merger Sub 2 continuing as the surviving entity and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of us.

Merger
 
As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of Intermex common stock (“Intermex Common Stock”) will convert into the right to receive a combination of cash and shares of our common stock (“Company Common Stock”), as calculated pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Consideration
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the aggregate consideration to be paid by us in the Merger will consist of (i) $92,000,000 in cash ($2,000,000 of which will be placed in escrow at closing as security for working capital adjustments), (ii) approximately $161,000,000 in shares of Company Common Stock, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and (iii) an amount (as determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement) equal to any excess cash at Intermex at the time of the closing in the form of cash or additional shares of Company Common Stock, at our option, subject to certain limited exceptions. The cash consideration will be funded from the cash held in our trust account after permitted redemptions.
Redemption Offer
 
Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, we will be providing our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem, upon the closing of the Merger, their shares of Company Common Stock for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit as of two (2) business days prior to the consummation of the Merger in our trust account (which holds the proceeds of our initial public offering, less taxes payable or amounts released to us for working capital purposes in an amount not to exceed $500,000) (the “Redemption Offer”).
Representations, Warranties and Covenants
 
Each of Intermex, us, and the Merger Subs have made representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement that are customary for transactions of this nature. The representations and warranties of us, the Merger Subs and Intermex will not survive the closing of the Merger.
 
Conditions to Consummation of the Merger
 
Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including, among others, that (i) the Merger be approved by our stockholders and Intermex’s stockholder; (ii) there has been no material adverse effect with respect to Intermex or us since the date of the Merger Agreement; (iii) our organizational documents will be amended and restated as described in the Merger Agreement; (iv) the parties will have received certain governmental consents and authorizations to the Merger; (v) all applicable waiting periods and any extensions thereof under applicable antitrust, competition or similar laws will have expired or been terminated; and (vi) we will have at least $125,000,000 in our trust account as of the closing, after giving effect to the redemption of public shares by our public stockholders and the payment of deferred underwriting fees.
    Termination
 
The Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the consummation of the Merger (whether before or after our and Intermex’s required stockholder votes have been obtained) by mutual written consent of us and Intermex and in certain other limited circumstances, including if the Merger has not been consummated by September 19, 2018 (the “end date”); provided that either Intermex or us may extend the end date until December 19, 2018, if necessary to obtain required approvals with respect to certain governmental consents and authorizations, if, at the end date, all of the other conditions to closing are satisfied. If the Merger Agreement is validly terminated, no party thereto will have any liability or any further obligation to any other party under the Merger Agreement, with certain limited exceptions, including liability for any willful breach of the Merger Agreement.

Additional Agreements to be Executed at Closing
 
The Merger Agreement provides that, upon consummation of the Merger, we will enter into a registration rights agreement and a shareholders agreement.
 
Registration Rights Agreement
 
Upon consummation of the Merger, we will enter into a registration rights agreement with certain of our stockholders and certain former stockholders of Intermex with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock currently held or that will be issued as partial consideration under the Merger Agreement, as applicable (the “Registration Rights Agreement”). The Registration Rights Agreement will require us to, among other things, file a resale shelf registration statement on behalf of the stockholders promptly after the closing of the Merger. The Registration Rights Agreement will also provide certain demand rights and piggyback rights to the stockholders, subject to underwriter cutbacks and issuer blackout periods. We will agree to pay certain fees and expenses relating to registrations under the Registration Rights Agreement.
Shareholders Agreement
 
Upon consummation of the Merger, we will enter into a shareholders agreement with certain former stockholders of Intermex and certain of our existing stockholders (the “Shareholders Agreement”), pursuant to which the former Intermex stockholders will receive certain director nominee designation rights and our stockholders will receive certain board observer rights, and all the stockholders party thereto will agree to vote for the director nominees designated under the agreement. The Intermex stockholders will cease to have any continuing director designation rights under the Shareholders Agreement if their collective ownership of Company Common Stock is at any time less than 5% of the total outstanding Company Common Stock. The Shareholders Agreement also contains certain provisions (including a lock-up provision) intended to maintain, following the consummation of the Merger, our qualification as a “Controlled Company” within the meaning of Rule 5615 of the Nasdaq Corporate Governance Requirements.
Voting Agreement
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we, Intermex and certain of our existing stockholders entered into a Voting Agreement (the “Voting Agreement”). Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, the stockholders party thereto have agreed to, among other things, vote all of the shares of Company Common Stock held by such stockholders (i) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (ii) against any actions that would result in a breach by us of any obligations contained in the Merger Agreement; (iii) in favor of the proposals set forth in our preliminary proxy statement/prospectus (and definitive proxy statement/prospectus, when available) to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) relating to the Merger; and (iv) against alternative proposals or transactions to the Merger.


The Voting Agreement generally prohibits the stockholders party thereto from transferring, or permitting to exist any liens on, their shares of Company Common Stock prior to the consummation of the Merger. The Voting Agreement will automatically terminate upon the first to occur of (i) the closing of the Merger and (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interest or assets of the target business or businesses. The Merger contemplates the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Intermex.

Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not independently able to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm, and reasonably acceptable to Cantor Fitzgerald, as representative of the underwriters. On December 12, 2017, our board received the opinion of BTIG, LLC that the fair market value of Intermex satisfies this Nasdaq requirement.
 
Business Strategy
 
We have sought to capitalize on the significant financial services, financial technology and banking experience and contacts of Daniel G. Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, Betsy Z. Cohen, our Chairman of the Board, and James J. McEntee, III, our President and Chief Financial Officer, and our board of directors to identify, evaluate, acquire and operating a financial technology businesses.
 
Our management team and a majority of our board of directors served as executive officers and/or directors of FinTech I, a former blank check company which raised $100.0 million in its initial public offering in February 2015 and completed its initial business combination in July 2016. We believe that potential sellers of target businesses will view the fact that our management team has successfully closed a business combination with a vehicle similar to our company as a positive factor in considering whether or not to enter into a business combination with us. However, past performance by our management team is not a guarantee of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate.
 
Mr. Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, Mrs. Cohen, our Chairman of the Board, and Mr. McEntee, our President and Chief Financial Officer, have extensive experience in the financial services industry, generally, and the financial technology industry in particular as well as extensive experience in operating financial services companies in a public company environment.
 
Mr. Cohen, with over 20 years of experience, is a founder and the Chairman of Bancorp. Mr. Cohen also served as Chief Executive Officer, President and a director of FinTech I until the FinTech I acquisition of FTS Holding Corporation (the “FinTech I Acquisition”). Mr. Cohen is the Vice Chairman and Head of Europe of IFMI (NYSE: IFMI), an investment firm specializing in credit-related fixed income investments, and is an officer and director of subsidiaries of Institutional Financial Markets, including JVB Financial, a registered broker-dealer. He is also a past Chief Executive Officer and trustee of RAIT (NYSE: RAS), a real estate investment trust with approximately $3.9 billion of total assets as of September 30, 2016 focused on commercial mortgage leading, and was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Taberna Realty Finance Trust, a real estate investment trust, until its merger into RAIT. Mr. Cohen was also a past director of Jefferson Bank of Pennsylvania, a commercial bank acquired by Hudson United Bancorp in 1999.
 
Mrs. Cohen, with over 40 years of experience, is a founder, and from September 2000 through December 2014 served as the Chief Executive Officer of, Bancorp (NASDAQ: TBBK), a financial holding company with approximately $4.22 billion of total assets as of September 30, 2016, whose principal subsidiary is The Bancorp Bank, a bank that provides a wide range of commercial and retail banking products and services to both regional and national markets. Bancorp’s customers access its banking services through its website and obtain cash withdrawals from automated teller machines. Bancorp provides affinity banking services to members and employees of organizations or businesses under the name of and through the website of such organization or business, and has developed extensive systems for processing debit and credit card transactions and providing prepaid, or stored value, card services. Mrs. Cohen also served as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of FinTech I until the Fintech I Acquisition and, following the FinTech I Acquisition, continues to serve on the FinTech I board of directors. Mrs. Cohen is also a founder of RAIT, and was its Chairman until December 2010 and its Chief Executive Officer until December 2006. She was also the founder and Chief Executive Officer of JeffBanks, a publicly traded bank holding company, and its subsidiary banks from 1974 until the sale of JeffBanks to Hudson United Bancorp in December 1999.

Mr. McEntee, with over 20 years of experience, is a director of Bancorp and The Bancorp Bank, was previously the Chief Executive Officer of Alesco Financial, an investment firm specializing in credit related fixed income investment, until it merged with Cohen & Company and was the Chief Operating Officer of Cohen & Company. Mr. McEntee also served as the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of FinTech I until the Fintech I Acquisition. In addition, he was a managing director of IFMI and the Vice-Chairman and Co-Chief Operating Officer of JVB Financial.
 
We have identified the following criteria that were used in evaluating business transaction opportunities:
 

● | History of free cash flow generation. We have sought to acquire one or more businesses or assets that have a history of, or potential for, strong, stable free cash flow generation, with predictable and recurring revenue streams. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Revenues and Enterprise Value. We have sought to acquire one or more businesses with annual revenues of approximately $150 million to $750 million and an enterprise value of approximately $500 million to $1.5 billion. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong management team. We have sought to acquire one or more businesses or assets that have strong, experienced management teams or those that provide a platform for us to assemble an effective and experienced management team. We have focused on management teams with a proven track record of driving revenue growth, enhancing profitability and creating value for their stockholders. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunities for add-on acquisitions. We have sought to acquire one or more businesses or assets that we can grow both organically and through acquisitions. In addition, we believe that our ability to source proprietary opportunities and execute transactions will help the business we acquire grow through acquisition, and thus serve as a platform for further add-on acquisitions. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Spin-offs/divestitures of non-core businesses or assets from larger companies. We have focused on one or more businesses or assets that are part of larger companies where the owners seek to divest or spin-off such businesses in order to free up capital to focus on core activities. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Defensible business niche. We have sought to acquire on one or more businesses or assets that have a leading or niche market position and that demonstrate advantages when compared to their competitors, which may help to create barriers to entry against new competitors. We anticipate that these barriers to entry will enhance the ability of these businesses or assets to generate strong profitability and free cash flow. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diversified customer and supplier base. We have sought to acquire one or more businesses or assets that have a diversified customer and supplier base, which are generally better able to endure economic downturns, industry consolidation, changing business preferences and other factors that may negatively impact their customers, suppliers and competitors. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Strengths 
 
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
 

● | Management Operating and Investing Experience. Our directors and executive officers have significant experience in the financial services and financial technology industries. Daniel G. Cohen, with over 20 years’ experience in the financial services industry, is a founder of Bancorp, the Chairman and Chief Investment Officer of an investment bank and is an officer and director of a broker-dealer subsidiary of the investment bank. Betsy Z. Cohen has over 40 years’ experience in the financial services industry and is a founder of and, until her retirement in December 2014, served as chief executive officer of, The Bancorp, Inc., a financial holding company whose banking subsidiary, The Bancorp Bank, provides banking services principally through the internet. James J. McEntee, III, with over 20 years of experience in the financial services industry, is a director of The Bancorp, Inc. and The Bancorp Bank, was previously the Chief Executive Officer of an investment firm specializing in credit related fixed income investment, a managing director of IFMI and the Vice-Chairman and Co-Chief Operating Officer of JVB Financial. Additionally, each of Mr. Cohen, Mrs. Cohen and Mr. McEntee served as an executive officer and/or director of FinTech I. We believe that this breadth of experience provides us with a competitive advantage in evaluating businesses and acquisition opportunities in our target industry. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Established Deal Sourcing Network. As a result of their extensive experience in the financial services industry, our management team members have developed a broad array of contacts in the industry. We believe that these contacts will be important in generating acquisition opportunities for us. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong Financial Position and Flexibility. With a trust account initially in the amount of $175,000,000 and a public market for our common stock, we offer a target business a variety of options to facilitate a future business transaction and fund the growth and expansion of business operations. Because we are able to consummate an initial business transaction using our capital stock, debt, cash or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to design an acquisition structure to address the needs of the parties. We have not, however, taken any steps to secure third party financing and would only do so simultaneously with the consummation of our initial business transaction. Accordingly, our flexibility in structuring an initial business transaction may be constrained by our ability to arrange third-party financing, if required. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Status as a Public Company. We believe our structure makes us an attractive business transaction partner to prospective target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business transaction with us. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock. Once public, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders’ interests than it would as a private company. We believe that being a public company can also augment a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid it in attracting and retaining talented employees. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the initial public offering and the private placement, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination.
 
If we pay for our initial business combination using stock or debt securities, or we do not use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or for redemptions or purchases of our common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
Nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. However, if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq or another securities exchange, we will no longer be subject to that requirement.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities to finance our initial business combination, and we may effectuate an initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or Nasdaq, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.

Sources of Acquisition Candidates
 
Target business candidates were brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds, brokers and other members of the financial community and corporate executives. These target candidates may present solicited or unsolicited proposals. Such sources became aware that we were seeking a business combination candidate by a variety of means, including publicly available information relating to the initial public offering, public relations and marketing efforts or direct contact by management following the completion of the initial public offering.
 
Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, also brought to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their contacts. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only if our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our initial stockholders or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is), other than (i) repayment of loans made to us prior to the date of the initial public offering by our sponsor to cover offering-relating and organization expenses and (ii) repayment of the up to $1,100,000 in incremental loans that our sponsor has committed to make to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination (provided that if we do not consummate an initial business combination, we may use working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment other than interest earned thereon). None of the initial holders, our officers, our directors or any of their respective affiliates will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder’s fees or consulting fees from a prospective acquisition target in connection with a contemplated acquisition of such target by us. Although some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the acquired business following our initial business combination, the presence or absence of any such arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, initial holders, officers, directors or their affiliates. Additionally, we are not prohibited from partnering, submitting joint bids, or entering into any similar transaction with such persons in the pursuit of an initial business combination. If we seek to complete an initial business combination with such a company or we partner with such persons in our pursuit of an initial business combination, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm, and reasonably acceptable to Cantor Fitzgerald, as representative of the underwriters, that such an initial business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view. Generally, such opinion is rendered to a company’s board of directors and investment banking firms may take the view that stockholders may not rely on the opinion. Such view will not impact our decision on which investment banking firm to hire.
 
Unless we consummate our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain a financial fairness opinion from an independent investment banking firm. If we do not obtain such an opinion, our stockholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value and fairness based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. The application of such standards would involve a comparison, from a valuation standpoint, of our business combination target to comparable public companies, as applicable, and a comparison of our contemplated transaction with such business combination target to other then-recently announced comparable private and public company transactions, as applicable. The application of such standards and the basis of our board of directors’ determination will be discussed and disclosed in our tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination.

Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination
 
Subject to the Nasdaq requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination, our management had virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we are not permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. However, if our securities are not listed on Nasdaq or another securities exchange, we will no longer be subject to the Nasdaq requirement. In any case, we intend to consummate our initial business combination only if we (or any entity that is a successor to us in a business combination) will acquire a majority of the outstanding voting securities or assets of the target with the objective of making sure that we are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We have sought to acquire established companies that have demonstrated sound historical financial performance. Although we are not restricted from doing so, we do not intend to acquire start-up companies. To the extent we effect a business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management has evaluated the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, and in evaluating Intermex in particular, we conducted an extensive due diligence review which encompassed, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. We will not pay any finders or consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with a business combination.
 
We intend to hold a special meeting of our stockholders to approve the Merger and related proposals. Assuming all conditions to closing are met or otherwise waived, we expect to consummate the Merger in the second quarter of 2018. However, there are no assurances that the Merger will close by such time or at all.
 
Lack of business diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
 

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited ability to evaluate the target’s management team
 
Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating a target business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. The future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. If the Merger is consummated, all of our current officers and directors will resign and will not serve the combined company.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Stockholders may not have the ability to approve a business combination
 
We may not seek stockholder approval before we effect our initial business combination as not all business combinations require stockholder approval under applicable state law. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or Nasdaq, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. We intend to hold a special meeting of our stockholders to approve the Merger and related proposals. Presented in the table below is a table of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.
 

Type of Transaction | Whether Stockholder Approval is Required 
------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 

 
Permitted purchases of our securities
 
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial holders, directors, officers or their respective affiliates may purchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination, although as of the date of this Annual Report they have no commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions. If they do effect such purchases, we anticipate that they would approach a limited number of large holders of our securities that have voted against the business combination or sought redemption of their shares, or that have indicated an intention to do so, and engage in direct negotiations for the purchase of such holders’ positions. All holders approached in this manner would be institutional or sophisticated holders. There is no limit on the number of shares they may acquire. Our initial holders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act or in transactions that would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10(b)-5 under the Exchange Act. Although they do not currently anticipate paying any premium purchase price for such public shares, there is no limit on the price they may pay. They may also enter into transactions to provide such holders with incentives to acquire shares or vote their shares in favor of an initial business combination. We will notify stockholders of such material purchases or arrangements that would affect the vote on an initial business combination, if any, by press release, filing a Form 8-K or by means of a supplement to our proxy statement. No funds in the trust account may be used to effect purchases of shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.

The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of the business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the consummation of a business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
As a consequence of any such purchases by our initial stockholders, directors, officers or their affiliates, the public “float” of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to obtain the continued listing of our securities on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange in connection with our initial business combination
 
Our initial stockholders, officers, directors and/or their respective affiliates anticipate that they will identify the public stockholders with whom they may pursue privately negotiated purchases through either direct contact by the public stockholders or by our receipt of redemption requests or votes against the business combination submitted by such public stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. The sellers of any shares so purchased by our initial stockholders, officers, advisors, directors and/or their affiliates would, as part of the sale arrangement, revoke their election to redeem such shares and withdraw their vote against the business combination. The terms of such purchases would operate to facilitate our ability to consummate a proposed business combination by potentially reducing the number of shares redeemed for cash.
 
Redemption rights for public stockholders upon consummation of our initial business combination
 
We will provide our stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares upon the consummation of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any amounts representing deferred underwriting commissions and interest earned on the trust account, less any interest released to us for working capital purposes or the payment of taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The initial holders and Cantor Fitzgerald have each agreed with respect to their founder shares and placement shares, and in the case of the initial holders, any public shares held by them, to waive their respective redemption rights in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination.
 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or by a Nasdaq listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) agreed to in connection with the negotiation of terms of the proposed business combination, and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to consummating our initial business combination that will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
10

 

If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem must remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to consummate our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period.
 
In connection with the consummation of our business combination, we may redeem pursuant to a tender offer up to that number of shares of common stock that would permit us to maintain net tangible assets of $5,000,001. However, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our proposed initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or members of its management team, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the allocation of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. If the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly tendered plus the amount of any cash payments required pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceeds the aggregate amount of cash available to us, taking into consideration the requirement that we maintain net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 or such greater amount depending on the terms of our potential business combination, we will not consummate the business combination, we will not purchase any shares of common stock pursuant to the tender offer and any shares of common stock tendered pursuant to the tender offer will be returned to the holders thereof following the expiration of the tender offer.
 
When we conduct a tender offer to redeem our public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination, in order to comply with the tender offer rules, the offer will be made to all of our stockholders, not just our public stockholders. In connection with any such tender offer, holders of founder shares have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, placement shares and public shares and Cantor Fitzgerald has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its placement shares.
 
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or Nasdaq, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will:
 

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon consummation of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will consummate our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. Our sponsor and the other initial holders have agreed to vote their founder shares and placement shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares, irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction, for cash equal to its pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest but less interest released to us for working capital purposes, to pay taxes or dissolution costs and subject to certain volume limitations, as described below. In addition, holders of founder shares have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, placement shares and public shares, and Cantor Fitzgerald has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its placement shares, in connection with the consummation of a business combination.
 
11

 

Many blank check companies would not be able to consummate a business combination if the holders of the company’s public shares voted against a proposed business combination and elected to redeem or convert more than a specified maximum percentage of the shares sold in such company’s initial public offering, which percentage threshold has typically been between 19.99% and 39.99%. As a result, many blank check companies have been unable to complete business combinations because the number of shares voted, against their initial business combination by their public stockholders electing conversion exceeded the maximum conversion threshold pursuant to which such company could proceed with a business combination. Since we have no such specified maximum redemption threshold and since even those public stockholders who vote in favor of our initial business combination will have the right to redeem their public shares, our structure is different in this respect from the structure that has been used by many blank check companies. This may make it easier for us to consummate our initial business combination. However, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination. Moreover, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. If the amount of redemptions plus any cash required by our initial business combination would cause our net tangible assets to fall below $5,000,001, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares and the related business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination. The Merger Agreement requires that, unless waived by Intermex, the amount in our trust account at closing, after giving effect to the redemption of public shares, shall be no less than $125,000,000.
 
Limitation on redemption upon consummation of a business combination if we seek stockholder approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to excess shares. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding an aggregate of 20.0% or more of the shares sold in the initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 20.0% (less one share) of the shares sold in the initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small number of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to consummate our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
 
Tendering stock certificates in connection with redemption rights
 
If we hold a stockholder meeting to approve a potential business combination, we may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent up to two business days prior to the meeting date or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The proxy materials that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have until two days prior to the vote on the business combination to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
12

 

The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivers its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of a business combination.
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If the Merger is not consummated, we may continue to try to consummate a business combination with a different target until January 25, 2019.
 
Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination 
 
Holders of founder shares, and our officers and directors, have agreed that we have only until January 25, 2019 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination by January 25, 2019, we will distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, pro rata to our public shareholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs, as further described herein. If we have not consummated a business combination by January 25, 2019, or earlier, at the discretion of our board pursuant to the expiration of a tender offer conducted in connection with a failed business combination, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem all public shares then outstanding at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account, less any interest released to us for working capital purposes, the payment of taxes or dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
13

 

The initial holders and Cantor Fitzgerald have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and placement shares (i) in connection with the consummation of a business combination, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by January 25, 2019 and (iii) if we fail to consummate a business combination or if we liquidate prior to January 25, 2019. The initial holders have also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to public shares in connection with the consummation of a business combination and in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by January 25, 2019. However, if the initial holders of, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination or liquidate within the required time period. In addition, Cantor Fitzgerald will have the same redemption rights as a public stockholder with respect to any public shares it acquires. Cantor Fitzgerald has informed us that it has no current commitments, plans or intentions to acquire any public shares for its own account; however, if Cantor Fitzgerald does acquire public shares, it will do so in the ordinary course of its business or in the types of transaction. Cantor Fitzgerald will not make any such purchases when it is in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller, during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act, in transactions that would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10(b)-5 under the Exchange Act, or if prohibited by applicable state securities laws or broker-dealer regulations. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from us with respect to our founder shares, placement units or warrants if we do not consummate a business combination by January 25, 2019.
 
Our initial holders, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by January 25, 2019 unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us for working capital purposes or to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules).
 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from the net proceeds from the initial public offering and the private placement held out of trust, interest income on the balance of the trust account (net of any taxes payable), of which up to $500,000 will be released to us to fund our working capital requirements, and loans from our sponsor for working capital purposes and to pay expenses to identify an initial business combination to a maximum of $1,100,000, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purposes. If such funds are insufficient, Daniel G. Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer and a director and the managing member of our sponsor, has agreed to pay the balance of the amount necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $30,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment for such amounts.
 
The proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be less than the $10.00 per public share initially on deposit in the trust account. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
14

 

Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. If we do not obtain a waiver from a third party, we will obtain the written consent of our sponsor before our entering into an agreement with such third party. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver and where our sponsor executes a written consent. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, pursuant to a written agreement, Daniel G. Cohen has agreed that he will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a definitive transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below $10.00 per share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Mr. Cohen will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that Mr. Cohen will be able to satisfy those obligations.
 
If the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.00 per public share and Mr. Cohen asserts that he is unable to satisfy any applicable obligations or that he has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Mr. Cohen to enforce his indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Mr. Cohen to enforce his indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in a particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share.
 
We will have access to the net proceeds from the initial public offering and the private placement held out of trust, any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account, less any interest to pay our franchise and income taxes, up to $500,000 for working capital purposes and up to $100,000 for dissolution expenses, and the commitment of our sponsor to loan us up to $1,100,000 with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation). If we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares if we do not consummate our initial business combination by January 25, 2019 may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination by January 25, 2019 is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we have not consummated a business combination by January 25, 2019, or earlier at the discretion of our board, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem all public shares then outstanding at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account, less any interest released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, up to $500,000 for working capital purposes and up to $100,000 to pay dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following January 25, 2019 and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
15

 

Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations are limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we have sought to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation and Mr. Cohen’s indemnification of the trust account against certain claims as previously described in this section, we believe that the claims that could be made against us will be significantly limited and that the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote.
 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.
 
We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not consummate a business combination by January 25, 2019, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by January 25, 2019 or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the consummation of the initial business combination. Also, our management may cease to pursue a business combination prior to January 25, 2019 (our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration if it determines, in its business judgment, that it is improbable within the remaining time to identify an attractive business combination or satisfy regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a business combination). In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for a business combination, we encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash to our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights will reduce the resources available to us for an initial business combination. In addition, the number of our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses.

Facilities
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 2929 Arch Street, Suite 1703, Philadelphia, PA 19104-2870. The cost for this space is being borne by an affiliate of our sponsor, without cost to us.
 
We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
 
Employees
 
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our affairs but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period varies based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We have registered our units, common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain consolidated financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. The public may read and copy materials we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You may obtain information about the operations of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.
 
We are required to evaluate and report on our internal control procedures as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, although if our non-convertible debt issued within a three year period or revenues exceeds $1 billion, or if the market value of our common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of our second fiscal quarter, we would cease to be an “emerging growth company” as of the following fiscal year.
