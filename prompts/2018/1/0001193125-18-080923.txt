--------+----------

Company Overview 
 We are a consumer-centric, food- and agriculture-focused company. By combining our leading gene-editing technology and technical expertise with our innovative commercial strategy, we are pioneering a paradigm shift to deliver healthier food ingredients for consumers and agriculturally advantageous traits for farmers. We are developing and creating specialty food ingredients, such as healthier oils and high fiber wheat, and food crops with desirable traits, such as herbicide tolerance. While the traits that enable these characteristics may occur naturally and randomly through evolutionor under a controlled environment through traditional agricultural technologiesthose processes are imprecise and take many years, if not decades. Our technology enables us to precisely and specifically edit a plant genome to elicit the desired traits and characteristics, resulting in a final product that has no foreign DNA. We believe the precision, specificity, cost effectiveness and development speed of our gene-editing technologies will enable us to provide meaningful disruption to the food and agriculture industries. 
 Our first product candidate, which we expect to be commercialized by the end of 2018, is a high oleic soybean designed to produce a healthier oil that has increased heat stability with zero trans fats. Among our other product candidates are high fiber wheat and herbicide tolerant wheat. We are developing a high fiber wheat to create flour with up to three times more dietary fiber than standard white flour while maintaining the same flavor and convenience of use. Our high fiber wheat may provide benefits associated with a high fiber diet, including reduced risk of coronary heart disease. Our herbicide tolerant wheat is designed to provide farmers with better weed control options to increase yields. We believe each of these three product candidates addresses a multibillion dollar market opportunity. 
 As awareness of these diet-related health issues grows, consumers have emphasized a healthier lifestyle and a desire for nutritionally rich foods that are better tasting, less processed and more convenient. This trend is leading to an increase in the demand for higher valued, premium segments of the food industry, such as higher fiber, reduced gluten and reduced fat products. As a result of these trends, food companies are looking for specialty ingredients and solutions that can help them satisfy their customers evolving needs and drive growth in market share and new value added products. 
 While food companies are focused on these trends, we believe the legacy agriculture companies have overlooked societys food-related issues and are not properly equipped with a business model to address health-driven consumer food trends. These legacy agriculture companies have historically focused on increasing yields and volumeto address population growthwhile increasing profit margins and market share by reducing input costs. They have been burdened by high research and development costs and a high degree of commoditization in their deep, farmer-focused supply chains. Industry sources indicate it can take an average of approximately 13 years and costs more than $130 million to generate a desired trait through traditional trait-development methods. In contrast, the food industry has seen new entrants growing aggressively and taking market share through premium segment product offerings from existing players, who are facing stagnating growth and divestitures in their core businesses. These factors have resulted in a disconnect between the legacy agriculture industry players current products and the consumers food-related health demands. 
 We believe that our proprietary gene-editing technologies and innovative commercial strategy will allow us to bridge the divide between evolving consumer preferences and the historical approach by the large legacy companies in the agriculture supply chain. 
 Using our proprietary technologies and expertise, we edit the genome of food crops by using our molecular scissors to precisely cut DNA in a single plant cell, use the plants natural repair machinery to make our desired edit and finally regenerate the single cell into a full plant. We believe we are able to develop targeted traits

  some of which would be nearly impossible to develop using traditional trait-development methodsquicker, more efficiently and more cost effectively than traditional trait-development methods. Our technology positions us to assess the probability of success early on in the research and development process, potentially eliminating expensive late stage failures and allowing for a larger breadth of products to be developed. We have a strong track record with respect to our technologies and expertise as we have successfully edited more than 20 unique genes in 6 plant species since our inception in 2010. 
 Our commercial strategy is centered on two core elements: developing healthier specialty food ingredients to enable the food industry to address evolving consumer trends and developing agriculturally advantageous traits, such as herbicide tolerance, for farmers. This will involve developing and leveraging our supply chain to effectively bring our consumer- and farmer-centric products to the marketplace. For our consumer-centric products, we intend to repurpose and leverage existing supply chain capacity by contracting, tolling or partnering with players in the existing supply chain, such as seed production companies, farmers, crushers, refiners or millers, which we expect will allow us to apply our resources to maximizing innovation and product development while minimizing our capital expenditures and overhead. For our farmer-centric products, we intend to broadly out-license our products to the seed industry. 
 We believe that we are able to identify a consumer or farmer need and develop a product from concept to fork or concept to field in approximately three to six years by utilizing our proprietary technologies and expertise and leveraging our innovative supply chain. We have an extensive product pipeline, as set forth in the table below, that is intended to address the potential market opportunities we have identified to date. 
 

We categorize our stages of pre-commercial development from Phase I to Phase III. Prior to entering Phase I, in Discovery, we identify genes of interest. In Phase I, we edit the identified genes of interest, target 
 
2 


  edits we desire to make, and produce an initial seed that contains the desired edit. Phase II is trait validation, where we perform small-scale and large-scale tests to confirm phenotype and ingredient functionality. In this phase we also perform replicated, multi-location field testing, after confirming that the product is not a regulated article by the USDA. In Phase III, we develop the first commercial-scale pilot production, begin to build out the supply chain and inventory and perform customer testing prior to commercialization. 
 While we intend to initially deploy our commercial strategy in North America with respect to our current product candidates, we also see many avenues of potential future growth beyond North America. In particular, over time we may explore opportunities to apply our commercial strategy elsewhere around the world and leverage our North American products and footprint to target geographies where there are unmet consumer or farmer needs. We also intend to explore the ability to add value through our existing product candidates once they are commercialized by combining traits in the same crop, which may allow us to create products with additional benefits without adding significant cost. In the near term, we are planning an expansion of our campus to enhance our gene-editing automation processes and develop a high-throughput discovery platform to identify new growth opportunities. We believe this high-throughput platform will allow us to discover more products, make more complex edits and enable us to drive product innovation at a significantly faster rate. We believe our expanded campus will be the only concept to fork facility of its kind, containing gene-editing labs, greenhouses, fields and a commercial kitchen to develop, test and showcase products. We believe all of these steps will enable us to remain at the forefront of food and agriculture innovation. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed 35 employees, of whom approximately 65.7% are involved in research and development and 9 hold a Ph.D. degree. Our multidisciplinary team includes experts in biology, chemistry, plant genetics, agronomics and other related fields. Several members of our executive team previously worked at industry-leading technology and agricultural companies, such as Monsanto Company, Syngenta AG and Cargill, Inc. As pioneers in the field of gene editing for plant sciences, members of our management team have invented TALEN, one of the premier gene-editing tools. 
 Calyxt was founded in 2010 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Cellectis, a leading gene-editing company with a focus on the development of immuno-oncology therapeutics. 
 The Evolution of the Food and Agriculture Industries 
 The Food Industry is Struggling to Find Solutions to Address Many of Societys Food-Related Issues 
 The United States is experiencing a dramatic increase in the prevalence of food-related health issues. In addition to being an underlying cause of some of the most prevalent diseases in western society, an unhealthy diet is a contributor to three of the ten leading causes of death: heart disease, diabetes and stroke. 
 As a result of the increase in food-related health issues, consumers have developed an increasingly heightened awareness of the role that dietary habits play in long-term wellness. This trend is especially prevalent in wealthier, developed nations where consumers have greater access to information that is helping to shift their consumption habits. 
 Regulatory agencies are playing a larger role in monitoring which food ingredients reach consumers. Beginning in 2018, the FDA will ban partially hydrogenated oils in foods, the primary artificial source of trans fat in processed foods. A recent study showed that New York State counties that implemented a ban on trans fats experienced an approximately 6% decline in hospitalizations for heart attacks and strokes as compared to New York State counties that did not. Additionally, following the passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, the USDA gained significant oversight of the federal school lunch program and holds the authority to set new, healthier standards for food sold in U.S. schools. These healthier food mandates include minimum serving requirements for fiber, fruits and vegetables and maximum allowable content standards for fat, sugar and sodium. 
 With todays consumers increasingly conscious and interested in the food they eat, buying habits have been creating dynamic shifts in the grocery aisle. The market has shifted from a focus on diet foods to a focus on 
 
3 


  real food as a way to maintain health. Yet it is sometimes difficult for customers to find healthy alternatives without compromising taste or convenience. Consumers now view foodparticularly food with health benefitsas the key to good health. More foods are being launched that go beyond basic nutrition to support health, digestive health, and higher energy levels. Locally sourced foods with a direct-to-consumer model are becoming more attractive, the demand for transparency in food sourcing, production and labeling is gaining traction, and consumers are discovering novel, foreign ingredients. We believe that as consumers continue the shift from a traditional production-driven food culture to a modern demand-driven food culture, they will continue to press companies and retailers for more information and accountability about how ingredients are sourced and processed, how real their food products are, and how responsive they are to consumers desire for choice and customization. 
 As consumers seek healthier and more nutritious food options, the health and wellness food sector has benefitted. Healthier food options are capturing an increasing share of the consumer wallet. As conventional multi-outlet channels and food processors try to capitalize on the fact that a significant percentage of North American consumers are willing to pay a premium for healthy and nutritious foods, their ability to quickly adapt to changing consumer demands is hampered by commoditized business models and supply chains. 
 The impact of changing consumer preferences is increasingly evident as market share and sales shifts towards smaller consumer packaged goods companies. These changes in consumer preferences benefit small and medium-sized companies with above-average growth and slowing the growth of the largest food and beverages companies. 
 As a result of the consumers rising demand for healthier food and the inability of traditional outlets and food processors to satisfy this demand, we believe that an opportunity exists for us to provide our innovative solutions for our customers and food industry. 
 The Agricultural Industry has Overlooked Societys Food-Related Issues 
 The agriculture industry has historically been burdened by high infrastructure costs in a market that has focused on price and market share resulting in commoditization. A highly segmented supply chain has also resulted in the legacy agriculture companies focusing on increasing margins and market share through increased yields and consolidation, and on passing along maximum value to the growers, thereby keeping pace with the growing demand for food globally. Over the past few decades the agriculture industry has seen a consolidation of over 200 seed companies, leaving the industry with only a handful of large, dominant players such as Bayer AG, Monsanto Co., DowDuPont Inc., AgReliant and Syngenta AG, which together accounted for approximately 78.1% of the U.S. seed sales for soybeans and 83.9% for corn in 20162017. In addition, development at these legacy agriculture companies has been significantly limited by time and cost constraints. According to industry estimates, genetic modification, a primary method of these companies to improve crops, requires an average of approximately 13 years and costs more than $130 million to progress a new crop from the discovery stage through commercialization. These innovations have primarily achieved increases in yields and food production volumes through the creation of herbicide tolerance and insect resistance, using genetically modified traits that in many cases contain bacterial DNA. We believe these industry dynamics explain the inability for the agricultural industry to evolve to a consumer- and farmer-focused approach, and thereby effectively meet their demands as societal trends shift and provide new market opportunities. 
Traditional Trait-Development Techniques 
 In addition to these market dynamics, innovation within the industry has been slow given the limitations of traditional trait-development techniques. While plant breeders have been crossbreeding varieties and selecting advantageous traits for thousands of years, the modern agriculture industry has relied primarily on two methods of crop improvement: 

 | Genetic Modificationthis involves the use of genetic technologies to randomly insert foreign genetic material, such as bacterial derived genes, into a plants genome for the development of seeds in which
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
4 


 
the inserted genes express specific traits. Historically, genetic modification techniques have been focused on mitigating negative yield impacts related to biotic causes, such as insect protection and herbicide tolerance traits.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The development process for genetically modified seeds involves: 
 

 | identifying genes, many times outside the plant kingdom, that may include desirable traits;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | randomly inserting the extracted genetic material into seeds, and delivering transgenic products that contain foreign DNA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | spending years testing, growing and confirming these random genetic modifications did not cause unintended consequences;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | working with global regulatory bodies to approve the above; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | working with an agricultural supply chain to ensure broad adoption of the new trait in varieties across multiple countries, justifying the high development costs this process requires.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The use of genetically modified crops has continued to face challenges due to various factors, including: 
 

 | high development costs and a lengthy development process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | a significant regulatory burden associated with obtaining marketing approval; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prevalence of durability issues such as weed resistance to chemistries used in herbicide tolerant crops and the evolution of insect resistance to toxins produced by genetically engineered crops with insecticidal traits.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Chemical Mutagenesisthis process involves the induction of mutagenesis in plants using agents and chemicals. Chemical mutagenesis creates non-specific mutations throughout the whole plant genome. As a result, mutagenesis techniques have proven to be slow, random and have not yielded disruptive agricultural improvements. The major limitations of mutagenesis include:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | off-target effects that can induce unwanted mutations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | lengthy development process of up to ten years or longer necessary to identify the desired mutations, remove the unwanted mutations and breed the new mutations into commercial seeds; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | applicability is limited to certain types of mutations that do not require precision or complexity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While these primary methods for addressing the agricultural challenges will continue to be applied, we believe these approaches can no longer effectively meet societal demands for innovative solutions demanded by the consumer and the farmer. 
 Calyxts Solution: Bridging the Divide Between Evolving Consumer Preferences and the Agriculture Industry 
 We believe that our proprietary technologies and commercial strategy will allow us to bridge the divide between evolving consumer preferences and the historical approach by the legacy companies in the food and agriculture industries. 
Our Technologies 
 Using our proprietary technologies and expertise, we edit the genome of food crops by using our molecular scissors to precisely cut DNA in a single plant cell, use the plants natural repair machinery to make our desired 
 
5 


  edit and finally regenerate the single cell into a full plant. We are able to develop targeted traitssome of which would be nearly impossible to develop using traditional trait-development methodsquicker, more efficiently and more cost effectively than would be possible using traditional trait-development methods. Our technology also puts us in a position to assess the probability of success early on in the research and development process, potentially eliminating excess cost associated with traditional trait-development methods and further reducing the risk of our product development process. 
 We believe we are disrupting the agriculture and food industry by utilizing our proprietary gene-editing expertise to prototype and develop traits at a fraction of the cost while simultaneously reducing the time to market. We believe our trait development process makes it possible to commercialize a product in three to six years, which would make it possible to effectively respond to evolving consumer preferences and farmer needs. 
 We are poised to become a leader in agriculture innovation through the use of gene editing. Our scientists have developed certain critical elements enabling us to make precise edits to DNA in living plant cells, including the use of reagents referred to as sequence-specific nucleases and the delivery methods of those reagents to plant cells. Our proprietary gene-editing platform relies on our capacity to custom design DNA-sequence specific cutting enzymes, or nucleases, for any chosen gene we need to edit and our capability to introduce such custom-made nucleases into the living plant cells we want to edit. Our platform relies on precisely chosen protein families that can specifically recognize unique DNA sequences and can be tailored to target such sequences in any chosen gene or genetic region. 
 Our proprietary technologies and intellectual property portfolio enable us to edit the plant genome by knocking out genes or creating precise gene edits. We take advantage of our knowledge about plant gene function to create novel genetic variation that results in traits of value. In all applications, a feature that distinguishes our products from those created through genetic modification is that our crop varieties lack foreign DNA. As such, for each of the six product candidates we have submitted to date, the USDA has confirmed that the products are not regulated articles, which represents regulatory cost savings for the development of these products. 
 We believe a vast number of favorable traits can be created by editing the genes of the plants or by inserting genes that occur within the same plant species. To date, we have not targeted the development of any products that would require foreign DNA in the final product, and we prefer to focus on finding natural traits existing within a plant species that can be elicited in our products. Where no naturally occurring trait exists within the plant species, we may not be able to create the desired trait without inserting foreign DNA. We believe there are a sufficient number of naturally occurring plant traits to allow us to continue to grow and expand our product pipeline for the foreseeable future. 
 Our Commercial Strategy 
 Our commercial strategy is centered on two core elements: 
 

 | Developing healthier specialty food ingredients for the food industry to benefit consumersWe intend to disrupt the food industry by continuing to identify market opportunities to help food manufacturers provide consumers with healthier and better tasting foods without sacrificing convenience or quality. Given trends in consumer preferences, we envision selling specialty ingredients such as healthier oils, high fiber flours and ingredients with reduced allergen and carcinogen content to the food industry.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Developing herbicide tolerance and other agriculturally advantageous traits for farmersWe intend to disrupt the agriculture industry by developing agriculturally advantageous traits that have a broad appeal to farmers and the seed companies that sell to farmers. For example, we are developing a herbicide tolerant wheat product that is designed to be resistant to multiple herbicide chemistries currently in the market. Because these traits have broad applicability, we believe it is important to get these traits into as many seed varieties and acres as possible, similar to what has occurred in other
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

major row crops such as corn, soybean and cotton. Our strategy is to invent and develop these agriculturally advantageous traits for farmers and broadly out-license them to the seed industry, with the potential to collect license fees and royalties in return. We believe our two-pronged strategy will disrupt the traditional food and agriculture industries by aligning the needs of the consumer, farmer and the food and agriculture value chains. We intend to repurpose and leverage existing supply chain capacity by contracting, tolling or partnering with players in the existing supply chain, which will allow us to apply our resources to maximizing innovation and product development while minimizing our capital expenditures and overhead. As we continue to streamline our supply chain, we expect to enter into additional contracts and strategic partnerships within the various participants and members of the value chain, in an effort to maintain control of the process and help ensure product quality, manage cyclical demand changes and capture value.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe our product candidates will benefit from being grown, processed and stored utilizing the same existing third-party infrastructure and standard industry practices that are currently used in the non-GMO products in the industry. Our intent is to outsource to third parties, such as seed production companies, farmers under identity preservation contracts and soybean crushers or wheat millers, for the production and processing of our consumer-focused products. Given that our strategy is to outsource these processes, we do not anticipate using proceeds to build or purchase processing or farming assets. Once we establish a supply chain for our first consumer-focused product in soybeans and wheat, we anticipate that future products within the same crop will benefit from utilizing the same supply chain. 
 Farmers are an essential component of our business model as they produce and prepare crops for processing. Within the traditional agriculture industry supply chain, farmers sell to elevators or processors who operate a high volume/low margin business to store crops and convert them into consumer and industrial products. Our strategy is to partner with farmers to grow premium products and have them allocate some of their land to grow our crops and, in turn, we will then buy back the crops produced by the farmers. We can then contract with processors to create our specialty food ingredients, which we will market directly to food manufacturers. We can also take our product and negotiate prices with food manufacturers and capture the incremental value without substantial capital outlays using these closed-loop contracts. Due to our partnership-oriented, vertically-integrated supply chain, we believe we can create and retain more value for ourselves that we can share with our farmers and processers, creating a supply chain that is a favorable for all participants involved. 
 Soybean crushers that manage existing crushing and refining infrastructure in the United States have small margins and compete largely in commoditized low margin markets. We intend to sign tolling agreements, which are common in our industry, to hire the crusher and refiner to transform our grain into meal for animal feed and oil for human consumption. We believe this will enable us to focus our investment on building inventory and commercial activity while leveraging the existing third-party infrastructure and knowledge regarding processing and crushing in the soybean industry. We intend to replicate this model for our consumer-oriented wheat products. 
 The following chart shows our plans for commercializing our consumer-focused product candidates: 
 


We have made substantial progress in our supply chain execution. We currently have established relationships with multiple seed production partners, crop farmers and crushers, in addition to our internal capabilities. We believe that we can extract meaningful value from each of our relevant supply chains in a similar manner and we expect to establish similar relationships across the value chain with our wheat and canola product candidates.

 Our Product Pipeline and Commercial Opportunity 
 High Oleic Soybean (Consumer Trait)a Premium Oil Market Commercial Opportunity 
 Soybean oil has historically been partially hydrogenated to enhance its oxidative stability in order to increase shelf life and improve frying characteristics. This process, however, creates trans-unsaturated fatty acids, or trans fats, which have been demonstrated to raise low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL), both of which contribute to cardiovascular disease. The discovery that dietary trans fats increase the risk of several health issues led the FDA to rule in 2003 that manufacturers be required to include trans fat content information on the Nutrition Facts label of foods. In 2015, the FDA took a further step and banned the use of partially hydrogenated oils, the primary dietary source of artificial trans fat in processed foods, by all food manufacturers beginning in 2018. After the FDAs 2003 ruling, commodity soybean oilwhich leads to high trans fats in foodslost significant market share to other vegetable oils, such as palm oil and canola oil. 
 Monounsaturated fats, such as oleic acid, have been linked to reducing LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raising HDL cholesterols. Diets rich in monounsaturated acids are associated with lower fat mass and decreased blood pressure. High levels of oleic acids can be found in olive, canola, sunflower and safflower oils. The following chart shows the oil composition in our soybean oil compared to these and certain other oils: 
 


We developed a soybean trait that has produced oils with a fatty acid profile that contains 80% oleic acid, 20% less saturated fatty acids compared to commodity soybean oil and zero transfats, as shown in the chart below.

 Oil created from our high oleic soybean product candidate has multiple desirable characteristics as an ingredient for the food industry. The high level of oleic acid in our soybean oil enhances oxidative stability more than fivefold when compared to commodity oil. This eliminates the need for partial hydrogenation, and thus no trans fats are produced during oil production. Furthermore, our high oleic soybean oil offers additional potential benefits, including reduced saturated fats, a threefold increase in fry-life, and reduced polymerization upon frying at high temperatures. Soybean oil is also neutral in flavor, odorless and colorless, and is therefore highly desired as a food ingredient because it has limited impact on the sensory characteristics of the final food product. 
 Our high oleic soybean product candidate was created using our TALEN gene-editing technology. We designed TALEN to specifically target two fatty acid desaturase genes (designated FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B). These genes convert oleic acid (a mono-unsaturated fatty acid) to linoleic acid (a polyunsaturated fat). By specifically inactivating both the FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B genes by removing DNA with TALEN, oleic acid accumulates in the seedincreasing from about 20% to 80%. By key measures, including yield, our high oleic soybean variety performs comparably to its unedited counterpart. Further, our improved soybean variety does not contain any foreign DNA. Because our technology is so precise and we target genes with well known functions in the plant, we have not, to date, detected any other changes as a result of the gene-editing process or undesired effects in our product. 
 In mid-2015, we received a letter from the USDA indicating that our high oleic soybean variety is not a regulated article under the Plant Protection Act. This allowed us to test the performance of our soybean variety in the field. In November 2015, we announced the completion of the second year of multi-location field trials in Minnesota and South Dakota. The agronomic and yield performance of our high oleic soybeans is on par with the non-GMO variety used to create this product. In 2016, 45,000 bushels of soybean seeds were produced by our farmers and we established supply chain partnerships. 
 Our soybean product candidate is in Phase III of our development process, and we are making preparations to create the capacity to crush on a commercial scale, which will enable product testing by potential food company customers. During the third quarter of 2017, we completed the harvest of our high oleic soybean and produced more high-quality seeds than needed to meet our commercialization target date. We are currently completing our commercialization plan and anticipate commercialization by the end of 2018. The interim critical milestones to complete in 2018 to achieve that goal include the following: 
 

 | building up our commercial supply chain for seed, grain and oil;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | creating relationships with customers, and encouraging them to start testing oil created from our soybean product candidate;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | signing tolling agreements with one or more crushers; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | building up the commercial grain inventory toward the end of the 2018 crop year in order to generate 2019 oil and meal sales.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, our high oleic soybean product candidate can be stacked with other soybean traits. For example, we intend to combine our high oleic acid trait with a trait that reduces linoleic acid, which would further improve the quality of our oil for frying. We are also developing an improved protein composition trait, which is in the Discovery phase of our development process. We believe this trait will increase the value of the soybean meal. Soybean meal is an important source of dietary protein for animals, and our product may have a better balance of amino acids for animal nutrition. These output traits that affect oil and protein quality will be combined with traits of value to the farmer. Among these are herbicide and drought tolerance and traits that confer improved yield. Thus, we have established a pipeline in which additional traits can be stacked with our initial products to increase their commercial value over time. 
 In December 2017, we executed an agreement with FBN to expand the distribution and grower base of our identity-preserved high oleic soybeans. FBN will distribute our high oleic soybean seeds to growers in its 
 
9 


  network and register farmers for our program which allows them to enter into contracts for growing our premium products. This relationship will help develop a dedicated, high-quality grower base and bolster our supply chain operations in the upper Midwest. 
 Premium Oil Market Opportunity 
 According to industry sources, the vegetable oil market in North America is estimated at 40.7 billion pounds per year. Certain premium priced oils such as canola, sunflower, corn, cotton and others represent approximately 34% of this market, or approximately 14 billion pounds per year. We believe this market has grown by a 6.7% compound annualized growth rate over the trailing fifteen years. Data from the USDA suggests that the average price of various premium oils over the 10-year period ended 2016 was approximately $0.56 per pound versus soybean oil that we estimate currently sells in a range of approximately $0.33-$0.39 per pound. Based on these estimates, the premium oil market segment could potentially generate approximately $8 billion in annual revenue. Assuming the market grows at a 5% CAGR, which assumes 2% growth for inflation and 3% population growth, we believe this market opportunity could grow to approximately $13 billion in the next ten years. In addition, in the United States, according to a report by Qualisoy, high oleic soybean acreage and oil production is expected to more than double year upon year, resulting in 9.3 billion pounds of available soybean oil within the next decade. Accordingly, we believe the oil generated from our soybean product candidate targets a potential multi-billion dollar market. 
Vertically Integrated Soybean Franchise, Supply Chain and Business Model 
 We intend to pursue a vertically integrated business model for our soybean product candidate that we believe will provide three potential revenue opportunities: 
 

 | seed sales to farmers that are part of what is called the identity-preserved supply chain, which entails entering into a contract with the farmer, who, in return for a premium, produces and stores our soybeans while maintaining the quality and purity of our product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | oil sales to food companies; and
--+---------------------------------


 | meal sales to animal feed companies.
--+-------------------------------------

 The following chart shows a high level indicative approach to our business model within the supply chain: 
 


Soybean Germplasm (Seeds)Soybeans are a crop that is photoperiod sensitive, meaning the crop is sensitive to the length of the day. Plant breeders have developed soybean varieties that are adapted to distinct 
 
10 


  latitudes and agroclimatic conditionswhich are referred to as maturity groups. Different growing regions in the United States require different maturity groups. For example, the northern United States requires soybeans in the 1.5- 2.2 maturity group ranges, with farmers typically planting a few varieties within this range to diversify their risk. 
 We have in-licensed over thirty non-genetically modified soybean varieties with commercial rights. We intend to initially introduce our high oleic soybean product candidate in the northern United States on one variety within a particular maturity group range and over time expand to additional varieties to farmers in the same region to provide farmers with the ability to diversify their risk. We expect to continue this expansion over time by adding regions in other maturity groups and varieties. Over the next five to ten years we envision expanding our germplasm portfolio to early, middle and late maturity groups. We believe this strategy will enable us to expand our supply chain through additional crushing plants within target growing regions and at the same time lower potential premiums and production costs as we introduce into the supply chain additional varieties that meet the diversity of seed variety that farmers need to mitigate their risk. 
 Crusher operators are generally divided into two categoriescrushers owned and operated by large companies in the industry and crushers that are independently operated. Each group generally follows a different business strategy. Large crushers typically focus on maximizing utilization and production, whereas the independently operated crushers typically focus on maximizing profitability by specialization and production focus. Within our target regions, we believe there are many independent crushers that process soybean and that are underutilized. We expect this to provide us with a meaningful opportunity to leverage their services in our business model. 
 Farmers 
 We plan to initially focus our supply chain strategy on contracting with farmers within a 50-100 mile area from certain predetermined crushing plants with which we are forming commercial tolling relationships. This will allow these farmers and growers to deliver their grain to these crushing plants in a cost-effective manner to avoid high transportation costs. Over time, we foresee supplying farmers with seeds in multiple states near multiple crushing plants with which we have contracted. We believe that we can generate a successful supply chain by contracting with fewer than 2,000 farmers. 
 There are a number of key metrics by which we will measure our success in the established supply chain, including the number of farmers using our seeds to grow high oleic soybeans, the number of acres planted with our seeds, the number of farmers that we need to contract with in order to add an incremental crushing plant to the supply chain and the retention rate of how many farmers choose to grow our soybeans year after year. We also anticipate farmers continuing to grow multiple varieties from multiple seed companies, which means we may initially represent a small percentage of a particular growers soybean acreage. Over time, we plan to seek to increase that percentage and, as our product offering expands, become one of the partners of choice for that farmers soybean seed needs. 
 Soybean Meal Sales to Animal Food CompaniesAnother potential opportunity for our high oleic soybean is for consumption in soybean meal. Approximately 97% of the soybean meal consumption is in the animal nutrition industry, with the industry experiencing increased demand for differentiated and non-GMO soybean meal. As a result, we believe the soybean meal industry provides us another competitive opportunity as we establish our commercial strategy. 
 Soybean Oil CustomersGiven the characteristics of our soybean oilneutral taste, heat stability and fatty acid profile similar to olive oilwe believe our oil presents a competitive alternative to existing premium oils in multiple food application categories. 
 Additional Soybean Growth OpportunitiesWe intend to initially focus commercialization of our soybean product candidate in North America. However, over time, we foresee a number of expansion opportunities given

  the global nature of soybean uses, including extensive import and exports of soybean co-products such as meal and oils. Some of these expansion opportunities may include: 
 

 | Oil Exports: As global regulatory frameworks continue to evolve for gene-edited products, we believe we will have the opportunity to export our soybean oil to other markets, which in turn we expect will create the opportunity for additional market expansion and increased premiums.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Global Launches of High Oleic Soybeans: Soybeans are grown in other countries such as Brazil and Argentina. We therefore believe that we have the potential to expand our supply chain and business relationships to other countries, providing additional global opportunities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expand Product Offering in Existing Supply Chain: Once a supply chain is established, we believe we will have the potential to leverage the same acres, meal and oil sales to create additional value through increased quality, such as improved protein contents, or farmer-focused traits such as herbicide tolerance, improved yield and drought stress tolerance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expansion of Seed Sales: We believe that once we establish a supply chain in soybeans through commercial relationships with farmers, we may be able to expand our product offerings to these farmers.

High Fiber Wheat (Consumer Trait) 
 Fiber is the indigestible portion of food that is essential for healthy digestion. Research has shown that fiber may play a large role in maintaining bowel health, lowering cholesterol, stabilizing blood glucose levels and controlling weight gain. A high fiber diet has the potential to lower the rate of glucose entry into circulation, thus decreasing the risk of food-related chronic diseases, such as coronary artery disease and diabetes. The average American adult consumes approximately 15-18 grams of fiber daily, only half of the amount recommended by the U.S. Department of Healths dietary guidelines based on the average caloric intake. In recent years, the awareness of the health benefits of high fiber diets has increased. This has translated to a strong growth in demand for high fiber food products, with 38% of grocery shoppers now seeking high fiber foods. 
 We are developing high fiber wheat traits that could be used to produce white flour with up to three times more dietary fiber than standard white flour. We anticipate that by altering the proportion of certain slower digested carbohydrates in the wheat grain, we will increase dietary fiber. This would allow consumers to reach their daily value of fiber without changing their existing food preferences. These high fiber wheat product candidates will not contain any foreign DNA. 
 We believe our high fiber wheat flour will be incorporated into many food productsfrom pasta to bread. Whereas a single serving of whole wheat flour can provide 49% of an individuals daily fiber needs, a single serving of our high fiber flour may provide up to 100% of the recommended daily requirement thereby allowing food manufacturers to make high fiber products sought after by many consumers. 
 This product candidate is currently in Phase I of our development process and may launch as early as 2020  2021. The gene-edited wheat line has been identified and grown and the fiber levels are under examination in grain derived from greenhouse grown plants. 
 In addition to our high fiber wheat product candidate, we are also developing other consumer traits in our wheat pipeline, including a reduced gluten product candidate. 
 High Fiber Wheat Market Opportunity 
 According to industry sources, the wheat market in North America was estimated at 108 million tons in 2017 with approximately 43% produced for human consumption in the United States. Humans consume approximately 650 million hundredweight, or cwt, of wheat flour in the United States, including an estimated 91 million cwt of premium wheat flour. Assuming an average price of approximately $15 per cwt we believe the premium wheat market could represent a potential multi-billion dollar market opportunity 
 
12 


 High Fiber Wheat Germplasm (Seeds) 
 The wheat flour market in the United States consists of six classes, which are designated by color, hardness and growing season: hard red winter, hard red spring, soft red winter, soft white, hard white and durum. 
 The wheat classes grown by a particular farmer depend on geographic location and the germplasm offerings in the different classes of wheat. The classes pose different quality and functionality characteristics, and growing wheat of multiple classes diversifies harvest risk. 
 We plan to expand our product offerings into potentially all classes of wheat with an emphasis on those that provide superior functionality. We will then selectively in-license and acquire third-party genetics to build germplasm platform in potentially all classes of wheat. These additional product offerings will impact our regional expansion of production as well as market opportunities. 
 Flour 
 Miller operators fall into one of two categoriesmillers owned and operated by large companies in the industry and millers that are independently operated. Each group generally follows a different business strategy. Large millers typically focus on maximizing utilization, blending and economies of scale, whereas independently operated millers typically focus on maximizing profitability by specialization and production focus. We believe there are many independent millers that process flour that are underutilized and eager to work with specialty products. We expect this to provide us with a meaningful opportunity to leverage their services in our business model. We expect to commence commercialization of our wheat product, once developed, using two to four millers, and to expand that number as commercialization progresses. 
High Fiber Wheat Customers 
 The market for wheat-based products is diverse and, in the United States, includes fresh bread and rolls, snack bars and granola bars, pastries and doughnuts, frozen pizza, bakery snacks and Mexican foods. As a result, we believe there are multiple opportunities to supply our high fiber wheat to food producers. 
Additional High Fiber Wheat Opportunities 
 We intend to initially focus commercialization of our high fiber wheat product candidate in North America. However, over time, we foresee a number of expansion opportunities. Some of these expansion opportunities may include: 

 | Global expansion: We believe there would be potential in being able to export our high fiber wheat to other countries with conducive regulatory frameworks with respect to our products. We also believe that we will be able to grow high fiber wheat in other countries given the extensive amount of wheat grown outside of the North American market. We believe both of these opportunities create the potential for increased premiums and market penetration.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cross selling: Once we have established an initial relationship with a food industry customer, we believe there is potential opportunity to cross sell products to the customer. For example, the customer may also have a demand for our high oleic soybean or another product as the customers needs evolve.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Trait stacking: Another potential opportunity for us is using trait stacking. For example, we may be able to add characteristics to our high fiber wheat, such as reduced gluten or a more favorable carbohydrate profile. Alternatively, we may be able to add herbicide tolerance to our high fiber wheat. In each case, we would expect the additional trait to enhance the value of our products on a per unit basis and further drive demand.

 Herbicide Tolerant Wheat (Farmer Trait) 
 Weed control is one of the greatest challenges farmers face in producing crops. Weeds compete not only with crops for water, nutrients, sunlight and space, but also harbor insect and disease pests, clog irrigation and drainage systems, undermine crop quality, and deposit weed seeds into crop harvests. Poorly controlled weeds significantly increase farmers cost while reducing crop yield and quality. With the constant need to increase yields, herbicides are an important component of commercial food production and account for 70% of all agricultural chemical use. 
 Herbicide tolerance is a plants ability to withstand a particular chemical herbicide. Herbicide tolerance traits in crops can provide additional crop protection chemistry alternatives to control weeds and increase crop yields. Weed resistance is a growing problem in the United States and other countries in the world. As weeds develop resistance to herbicides they become more difficult to control which can reduce yields and the quality of crops. The use of different chemistries has been an important tool to control herbicide resistant weeds. For example, Glyphosate tolerant weeds are controlled with other herbicide chemistries effective in grasses. Certain cropssuch as wheat and soybeansmay not be tolerant to such chemistries, rendering this option non-viable for over-the-top applications. 
 Herbicide tolerant traits may offer farmers a vital tool in managing weeds effectively during crop production. The deployment of herbicide tolerant traits in wheat significantly lags other major crops and wheat production is constantly faced with yield-robbing weeds that can result in lower yield and higher dockage costs at the elevator. In the United States, nearly 90% of major row crops, including corn and soybeans, contain at least one herbicide tolerant trait. In contrast, no broad acre GMO herbicide tolerant trait has been developed for wheat, largely due to the complexity of the wheat genome. Without effective control, weeds can lower winter wheat yield by up to 23% on average worldwide, and in turn significantly decreases profitability potential. 
 Wheat Herbicide Tolerant Trait Opportunities 
 We are pioneering the development of herbicide tolerant traits in wheat without the use of foreign DNA, built using our TALEN gene-editing technology. Herbicides act by inhibiting the activity of certain plant-encoded proteins that promote plant growth. We aim to achieve herbicide tolerance by specifically making a subtle repair to prevent herbicides from being able to recognize and block functions of these proteins, such that the edited plant survives the application of the herbicide. Our product candidate will contain no foreign DNA. We believe this solution, if successfully developed and commercialized, will have the potential to increase the farmers yield and revenue. Accordingly, we believe our herbicide tolerant trait would have broad appeal and applicability into the 76 million acres of wheat that are grown in North America each year and potentially into the over 500 million acres grown worldwide. One industry source has suggested that there can be up to $71 per acre of loss for wheat due to weeds. Given the amount of wheat acreage in North America, products with herbicide tolerant traits represent a potential multi-billion dollar industry. 
 In September 2017, we successfully advanced our herbicide tolerant wheat program from the Discovery phase into Phase I development. In addition to herbicide tolerance, we are developing traits that are advantageous to the farmer including our variety of wheat that confers resistance to a fungal pathogen, namely powdery mildew. Powdery mildew resistant wheat advanced to Phase II in 2017 after successfully conducting the first field trial to assess agronomic and trait performance of the powdery mildew resistance trait line. We believe powdery mildew resistance may increase yield and reduce the need for the use of costly fungicides. 
 Building Up a Licensing Franchise and Supply Chain 
 We intend to develop our herbicide tolerant wheat technology and plan for initial commercialization in North America in the second half of the coming decade. Under this proposed model, we anticipate that we would establish licensing relationships with seed company customers (and public seed institutions) to enable conversion 
 
14 


  of elite wheat lines from multiple classes. These seed institutions would then sell seed containing our herbicide tolerant technologies either directly to farmers or through seed distributors. We would seek to receive royalty payments from these seed institutions. 
 Additional Licensing Growth Opportunities 
 We believe herbicide tolerant wheat represents the first broad licensing opportunity for a large acre trait for us in a major row crop. Additional licensing opportunities may include: 

 | Herbicide tolerant wheat being developed by us that will enable the application of two different types of chemistries currently available in the market (off patent chemistries). We could pursue a strategy to collaborate with strategic partners, exclusively or on a non-exclusive basis to register the application of chemistries on its herbicide tolerant wheat and seek additional revenue opportunities from such chemistries.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We could combine our herbicide tolerance technology in wheat with our high fiber wheat products under identity preservation, creating potential synergies between both products being sold on the same acreage.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Over 500 million acres are cultivated globally, and we could replicate our business model and deploy herbicide tolerant technologies in wheat in other world regions beyond North America.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Development and out-licensing of additional farmer traits in wheat such as disease resistance, additional herbicide tolerance products, improved yield products and other agronomic characteristics.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Similar or alternative herbicide tolerant technologies could be developed by Calyxt in other crops such as soybeans and canola, expanding the herbicide tolerance franchise across multiple crops, first in North America and then globally.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved Oil Composition Canola (Consumer Trait) 
 Our improved oil composition canola is our first canola product candidate. The development of this first canola product expands our improved oils franchise, in line with our mission to create healthier specialty ingredients and become a preferred partner of the food industry. In September 2017, we successfully advanced our improved oil composition canola program from discovery stage into Phase I development. 
Other Products in Our Development Pipeline 
 Our extensive product pipeline includes a variety of consumer- and farmer-centric traits for soybean, wheat, canola, alfalfa and potato. We will conduct further development programs to build upon our current pipeline, which currently includes improved oil composition canola, herbicide tolerant canola, improved quality alfalfa and herbicide tolerant alfalfa, late blight resistant potato, cold storable / reduced browning potato, improved protein composition soybean, drought tolerant soybean, herbicide tolerant soybean and improved yield soybean. In the future, we anticipate expanding our product pipeline to include other food crops. As of December 31, 2017, Calyxt had a total of nine product candidates in Phase I or higher across its five crops, which is reflective of our rapidly advancing product pipeline. 
 We plan to develop gene-editing automation processes that will enable us to implement a high throughput discovery platform to identify new growth opportunities. This high-throughput platform is intended to allow us to discover more gene traits and make more complex edits, enabling us to drive innovation at a significantly faster rate. We believe all of these steps will enable us to remain at the forefront of food and agriculture innovation. 
 In addition, during the third quarter of 2017, the USDA designated our alfalfa product, developed in collaboration with S&W Seed Company, as a non-regulated article under Am I Regulated? Process by Biotechnology Regulatory Services of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), an agency of the USDA.

 Technology and Process Overview 
 Calyxt is a Pioneer in Plant Gene Editing 
 Gene editing is a technological leapfrog that makes it possible to overcome many of the limitations of traditional trait-development techniques. Gene editing creates novel traits by making minor DNA sequence edits to plant genomes. These edits occur in a precise manner and at high efficiency, providing accelerated development and commercialization timelines and potentially lower regulatory hurdles. 
 The following chart depicts our development process: 
 


Step 1: We begin by identifying the gene target and the edit we would like to introduce into the plant genome. We do not have an in-house gene discovery platform. Rather, we supplement our own scientific knowledge and expertise with the efforts of universities, non-profit organizations, government agencies and gene discovery biotech companies to identify genes, which when altered, express desired crop traits. Some of the information on gene targets is in the public domain, and in other instances, we may engage in intellectual property licensing agreements. We believe there are scientific teams around the world continually identifying new gene targets, providing new opportunities for us to expand our product pipeline. We are typically able to assess gene targets and the types of edits to be introduced in several weeks. 
 Step 2: We create TALEN (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases) to specifically recognize the DNA target we seek to edit in the plant genome. TALEN were invented by our scientists and are one of the most effective reagents for gene editing. Two TALEN are used to recognize a given target, each of which recognizes 15-20 bases of the genetic code. A 30 base DNA sequence target occurs, on average, once every quintillion bases. Thus it is relatively easy to design TALEN to recognize unique sites in complex genomes. We have unparalleled expertise in TALEN design, and we have an automated TALEN assembly pipeline that allows us to make thousands of TALEN per weekfar more than what is needed for product development. 
 Step 3: We deliver our TALEN and other reagents as necessary to achieve the desired gene editing outcome to plant cells in a process known as transformation. We rely on three methods of transformationagrobacterium, particle bombardment and protoplastto deliver reagents to plant cells to achieve targeted edits at high efficiency. 
 Step 4: Gene editing typically occurs within a few hours after reagent delivery. 
 
16 


 Step 5: We place the edited cells in culture and allow them to grow and divide. The cells form a mass of unorganized tissue called a calli. Calli are produced for most plants cells we edit, and the callus stage can last from several weeks to several months. 
 Step 6: Once calli are obtained, we induce them to differentiate leaf and root tissues through the application of plant hormones. Shoots regenerate first and then roots, ultimately resulting in a plantlet. Depending on the plant species, this step can take from a few to several months. 
 Step 7: We screen the resulting plantlets to identify those with the desired gene edit. We have an automated pipeline to prepare and analyze DNA from plantlets to identify those that have the desired editing outcome. 
 Once the steps in the chart above are completed, we continue on to Phase II our development process by moving plants with edited genes to soil and growing them in the greenhouse to test for the intended trait and to produce more seed. This step is often the most time-consuming, and is constrained by biology; that is, it takes time for a plant to mature, flower and produce seed. Once we validate the trait in the greenhouse, we advance the edited plants to field trials. We carry out the field trials at multiple locations over multiple growing seasons. In some instances, we carry out field trials in the Southern hemisphere to capture two growing seasons in a given calendar year. 
 Gene Editing with TALEN 
 TALEN enable genome editing through a simple two-step processfirst by recognizing a specific DNA sequence, and then by precisely inducing a controlled DNA double-strand break. TALEN protein structure comprises a DNA-recognition domain and DNA-cleaving domain. DNA-recognition is achieved by individual repeat domains (depicted in the figure below as an array of spheres); each domain recognizes a specific nucleotide (depicted in the figure below as grey boxes). By rearranging central repeat domains, TALEN can be designed to target nearly any DNA sequence. DNA-cleavage is achieved by a nuclease that is fused to the DNA-recognition domain (depicted in the figure below as large half spheres). The nucleases must interact to cleave DNA, and cleavage occurs only after two TALEN precisely recognize a target DNA sequence. The requirement for two nucleases to interact minimizes cleavage at unintended sites due to binding of a single TALEN. 
 The following figure depicts the process of making gene edits using TALEN: 
 


A precisely placed double-strand DNA break is the key to unlocking gene editing. This break can be the substrate for a wide range of outcomes, from single nucleotide deletions, to large DNA insertions. Left alone, a DNA break will result in removal of nucleotides (through a process called non-homologous end-joining). This removal of nucleotides, if placed appropriately, can result in gene inactivation or a gene knock-out. Our high oleic soybean variety, for example, was achieved by gene knock-out. By precisely removing DNA, we inactivated two FAD2 genes, which resulted in the accumulation of oleic acid in the seed. 
 
17 


 If a user-supplied DNA fragment with a similar sequence to the TALEN binding site is provided at the time of the DNA break, then novel information in the user-supplied DNA is copied into the plant genome (through a process called homologous recombination). The information that is incorporated can be a single base change that repairs or edits the target gene to improve its function. For example, we believe herbicide tolerance can be achieved in many plant species by specifically making a subtle repair to prevent herbicides from being able to recognize and block functions of certain plant-encoded proteins that promote plant growth. Alternatively, it is possible to incorporate or knock-in one or more transgenes to create a new trait. At present, we are focused on using gene knock-outs and gene repair to create new traits. Other major agricultural biotechnology companies, which commercialize GMOs, are interested in targeted knock-in approaches. Gene editing and gene insertion through homologous recombination are collectively referred to as gene targeting. 
 Tissue Transformation Systems 
 Key to achieving a gene-edited plant is the ability to deliver TALEN to plant cells (a process referred to as transformation). Our scientists have proficiency using the three main methods of transforming plant cellsagrobacterium, particle bombardment and protoplast transformation. Agrobacterium is a soil bacterium that naturally delivers DNA to plant cells. This method can be used to deliver our TALEN; it can also be used to deliver templates to copy information to the break site. Particle bombardment uses DNA-coated gold or tungsten particles to deliver DNA to plant cells. The particles are shot at plant tissue at high velocity, and the DNA is either transiently expressed or integrated into the host genome. Protoplasts are plant cells lacking a cell wall. Our TALEN reagents can be directly delivered to protoplasts at high efficiency (between 50% and 90% transformation frequencies). Further, we have shown that purified TALEN proteins can be delivered to plant protoplasts to achieve gene editing, thereby obviating the need to use nucleic acids. Over the past six years our scientists have developed the expertise and know-how to deploy these methods in a variety of plant species. 
 We believe that our ability to select the appropriate transformation method, our capabilities to use these technologies, as well as our innovative solutions to achieve increased efficiency, creates both a competitive advantage and a barrier to entry. Our technology enables us to precisely and specifically elicit the desired traits with the desired characteristics in a matter of months. For example, in order to develop our high-oleic soybean oil, we designed TALEN to specifically target two fatty acid desaturase genes (designated FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B). These genes convert oleic acid (a mono-unsaturated fatty acid) to linoleic acid (a polyunsaturated fat). By inactivating both the FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B genes with TALEN, oleic acid accumulates in the seedincreasing from about 20% to 80%, which improves its characteristics for frying and is healthier for the consumer. 
 The plant transformation and regeneration steps described above are inherently scalable, and we envision that through the use of robotics, it will be possible to generate thousands of plantlets with a desirable gene edit. By implementing a platform that creates multiple plantlets with the same gene edit, we believe we will be able to greatly accelerate product commercialization. For example, if we are interested in developing wheat flour with a healthier carbohydrate composition, we can harvest enough seed from our population of edited plantlets to produce enough flour to test for functionality and ensure it has the properties desired for our customers. This eliminates the time needed to amplify enough seed over multiple generations from one or a few edited plants. 
 Key Advantages of TALEN Over Other Gene-Editing Technologies 
 In addition to TALEN, we are aware of three other classes of nucleases that enable gene editing, including meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases and CRISPR/Cas9. Despite the availability of other gene-editing platforms, we currently rely on TALEN because of the following benefits: 

 | Intellectual propertyWe have a strong intellectual property position with respect to TALEN technology and its use to make our product candidates. We have actively sought to protect our proprietary technologies and product candidates through the licensing of a portfolio of approximately 89 issued patents and 178 pending patent applications, as of December 31, 2017.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
18 


 
 | SpecificityTALEN may be designed to limit its DNA cleavage to the desired sequence and to avoid cutting elsewhere in the genome. This parameter is essential as plant genomes are highly complex; for example, the wheat genome comprises 17 billion bases.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | PrecisionIt is possible to design a TALEN that will cleave at any selected region in any gene. For example, there are four related FAD genes in the soybean genome. Our TALEN edited only the two genes that produce fatty acids in the seed; no edits were introduced into the other related genes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | EfficiencyA large percentage of cells treated by TALEN bear the desired gene edit. Because of TALEN efficiency, only a handful of plants have to be regenerated to recover those with edits in our target gene. For example, three of 19 transgenic soybean lines expressing the FAD2 TALEN transmitted heritable edits to the next generation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ValidationWe have a strong track record with respect to our technologies and expertise as we have successfully edited more than 20 unique genes in 6 plant species since our inception in 2010.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Ease of useWe have extensive expertise in the design and assembly of TALEN and can generate thousands of TALEN per week.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Comparison of Crop Development ProcessesTraditional vs. Calyxt 
 Our solution for agriculture biotechnology can provide significant speed and cost advantages as compared to the traditional trait-development methods employed by the current agriculture industry companies. Through our accelerated development process, we believe we are capable of commercializing our product portfolio significantly quicker and at reduced cost. 
Traditional Agricultural GMO Development Process: 
 We provide an overview of the development process involved in GMO trait commercialization, which is currently employed by the agricultural industry. This process typically requires an average of approximately 13 years and costs more than $130 million to develop a new trait:

 | DiscoveryThe screening and identification of potential traits of interest using foreign DNA which many times is from outside the plant kingdom. This process requires the expertise in genetics, molecular biology and bioinformatics/genomics approaches to identify target genes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase I (Proof of Concept)At this stage of development, tests are performed on a variety of constructs based on lead candidate genes. This is undertaken to achieve the optimal expression of gene in order to obtain the desired trait.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
19 


 
 | Phase II (Early Development)Plants with optimized genetic constructs are chosen and evaluated in greenhouse and field trials. This involves upwards of tens of thousands of plants being grown and evaluated.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase III (Advanced Development)Large scale field trials are conducted to measure trait expression and crop yield.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase IV (Pre-Launch)Build up seed inventory for commercial launch and regulatory studies to test the safety of the crop.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calyxts Accelerated Development Process: 
 We can assess the viability of a trait in less than two years and commercialize it in as short as six years with a significantly reduced development cost. 

 | Discovery (Several Months)The preliminary screening and identification of genes with the potential to deliver a trait of interest. We do not spend significant resources on the screening and identification of genes in plants that will lead to beneficial traits. Rather, we supplement our own scientific knowledge and expertise with the efforts of universities, non-profit organizations, government agencies and gene discovery biotech companies to identify genes, which when altered, express desired crop traits.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase I: Product Transformation & Event Selection (1-2 Years)The process to make our product, in which we leverage our gene-editing platform and expertise to induce the expression of a desired trait. We have proficiency in three different tissue transformation systemsagrobacterium, particle bombardment, and direct DNA delivery to protoplastswhich allows us to edit the genome in nearly all major crops. Once a product is created we grow seed in our greenhouse to initiate testing. At the end of Phase I, we submit a petition to the USDA to confirm the product candidate is a non-regulated article.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase II: Trait Validation (1-2 Years)After obtaining USDA confirmation, trait validation is conducted in small and large scale field trials. Small scale trials take place in a limited number of locations, where we test our products in the field and increase seed production. Larger scale field trials occur across multiple field locations and years and help us ensure our field performance across multiple conditions. At this stage we also test the specialty food ingredients produced from these plants for unique healthier properties. At the end of Phase II, we expect to be able to assess the technical viability of a trait. We can then decide whether to further invest in the product and continue to develop the asset or dispose of the asset with minimal development costs, allowing us to continue to innovate at a rapid pace.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase III: Pre-Commercial (1-3 Years)This phase is the first commercial scale production and provides us the opportunity to build seed and product inventory prior to commercialization. During this period we also establish our grower supply chains and customer relationships in preparation for commercialization.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | CommercialWhen a product is ready to be commercialized, we plan to utilize our innovative commercial strategy to leverage existing supply chains to ensure product quality, manage cyclical demand changes and capture value. Depending on what supply chain relationships may exist at the time when a product candidate is ready to be commercialized, we believe we may be able to leverage our existing supply chain relationships to lower commercialization costs and time to market. We plan to continue to build out our germplasm during commercialization to enhance our seed capability and regional footprint.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Opportunities 
 Wethrough our license agreement with Cellectishave access to intellectual property that broadly covers the use of engineered nucleases for plant gene editing. This intellectual property covers methods to edit plant 
 
20 


  genes using chimeric restriction endonucleases, which include TALEN, CRISPR/Cas9, zinc finger nucleases, and some types of meganucleases. The granted claims cover methods of introducing chromosomal edits through non-homologous end-joining to create gene knock-outs, as well as methods of introducing chromosomal edits by homologous recombination to produce precise gene edits or gene knock-ins. We believe this umbrella intellectual property applies broadly across gene editing in plants and makes us a key player in the gene editing intellectual property space. 
 Making precise edits through gene targeting is technically challenging, as frequencies of gene editing or DNA insertion are significantly lower than frequencies of gene knock-outs. Under our license agreement with Cellectis, we have exclusive sublicense rights (subject to existing non-exclusive sublicenses to third parties) to intellectual property exclusively licensed to Cellectis from the University of Minnesota in the field of researching, developing and commercializing agricultural and food products, including traits, seeds, and feed and food ingredients (excluding any application in connection with animals or animal cells). These patent applications cover the use of DNA replicons for gene editing. The replicons carry DNA sequences encoding TALEN as well as a DNA template to copy precise edits into the plant genome. When introduced into plant cells by any of the tissue transformation systems described below, the replicons amplify to a high copy number. This allows us to achieve gene editing at frequencies up to 12-fold higher than the use of traditional methods. The replicon technology, combined with our transformation platforms, expand the versatility of the TALEN technology for generating products. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property and proprietary protection for our product candidates and technology related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, licensing and filing United States and certain foreign patent applications related to our technology, products and product candidates, and improvements that are important to the development of our business, where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets to develop and maintain our proprietary position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and contractors. 
 Notwithstanding these efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have licensed or filed or may license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we have licensed or patents that may be licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and technology. Moreover, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see Risk FactorsRisks Related to Intellectual Property. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we have licensed approximately 18 U.S. patents, 44 U.S. patent applications, 71 foreign patents, and 134 foreign patent applications. Within this portfolio, approximately 192 patents and patent applications relate to the genetic editing of plants using TALEN technology, 131 patents and patent applications relate to the genetic editing of plants using meganuclease technology, 90 patents and patent applications relate to the genetic editing of plants using CRISPR technology, and 56 patents and patent applications relate to specific plant traits. 
 The issued patents in our portfolio consist of approximately 6 Cellectis-owned and 12 other in-licensed U.S. patents, 20 Cellectis-owned and 36 other in-licensed European patents, and 4 Cellectis-owned and 11 other 
 
21 


  in-licensed patents in other jurisdictions, including Japan, China, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mexico, Israel and Canada. The pending patent applications in our portfolio consist of approximately 40 Cellectis-owned and 4 other in-licensed U.S. patent applications, 21 Cellectis-owned and 5 other in-licensed European patent applications, 82 Cellectis-owned and 26 other in-licensed patent applications in other jurisdictions, including Japan, China, Australia, India, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Hong Kong, Singapore, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand and Canada, and 7 Cellectis-owned and 2 other in-licensed Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications. 
 Individual patent terms extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which patent applications are filed, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the first non-provisional application to which priority is claimed. Under certain circumstances, a patent term can be extended. For example, in the United States, a patents term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in reviewing and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. The issued patents that we have licensed will expire on dates ranging from 2020 to 2033. If patents are issued on the pending patent applications that we have licensed, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2023 to 2037. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 License Agreement with Cellectis 
 We are party to a license agreement with Cellectis, pursuant to which we have been granted an exclusive, worldwide license (subject to existing licenses granted by Cellectis to third parties) to use, commercialize and exploit certain intellectual property in the field of researching, developing and commercializing agricultural and food products, including traits, seeds, and feed and food ingredients (excluding any application in connection with animals and animal cells), except that such license is non-exclusive in such field for any activities relating to researching, developing or commercializing certain modified or mutated I-CreI homing endonucleases. We have also been granted a non-exclusive license to use the TALEN® trademark in connection with our exploitation of licensed products under the agreement. Any improvements we make to the licensed intellectual property is owned by us but licensed back to Cellectis on an exclusive basis for any use outside of our exclusive agricultural field of use. The exclusivity of our license agreement with Cellectis is subject to existing non-exclusive licenses granted to third parties in the field of research. 
 In consideration for the license from Cellectis, we are required to pay to Cellectis, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, a royalty of 3% of net sales of any products that are covered by the patents licensed from Cellectis. In addition, we are required to pay Cellectis 30% of revenue we receive for sublicensing our rights under the agreement to third parties. Our payment obligations to Cellectis will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the patents licensed to us by Cellectis. 
 Under our license agreement with Cellectis, and as between the parties, Cellectis has the first right to control the prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of the licensed intellectual property and we will have the right to step in and assume such control with respect to the patents owned by Cellectis and exclusively licensed to us under the agreement if Cellectis elects to not prosecute, maintain, defend or enforce such patents. In certain circumstances, if Cellectis elects to abandon any patents owned by Cellectis and exclusively licensed to us under the agreement, we have the right to assume ownership of such patents. In addition, some of the intellectual property that is licensed to us by Cellectis consists of a sublicense of intellectual property originally licensed to Cellectis by the University of Minnesota to exploit such intellectual property in our exclusive agricultural field of use. Therefore, as to such sublicensed intellectual property, our license from Cellectis is subject to the terms and conditions of the license agreement between the University of Minnesota and Cellectis, and to the extent our 
 
22 


  activities under such sublicense violate any terms and conditions of the license agreement between Cellectis and the University of Minnesota, we are responsible for any damages that Cellectis may incur. In addition, we are required to reimburse Cellectis for any and all payments made by Cellectis to the University of Minnesota pursuant to the license agreement between the University of Minnesota and Cellectis to the extent that any such payments are required to be made as a result of our applicable activities. Under the license agreement between Cellectis and the University of Minnesota, the University of Minnesota has the first right to control the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed intellectual property. 
 Our license agreement with Cellectis is perpetual. However, it may be terminated at any time upon the mutual written agreement of both parties, either partys uncured material breach of the agreement, or upon certain bankruptcy and insolvency related events. 
 License Agreement from Regents of the University of MinnesotaTALEN 
 In January 2011, Cellectis entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Minnesota, which was amended in 2012, 2014 and 2015. Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, Cellectis and its affiliates were granted an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license, under certain patents and patent applications owned by the University of Minnesota, to make, use, sell, import and otherwise dispose of products covered by the licensed patents, in all fields of use. These licensed patents relate to TALEN molecules and their use in gene editing. 
 Pursuant to the agreement, with respect to the agricultural field, Cellectis is required to pay to the University of Minnesota a low six digit annual fee per year, as well as a low five digit commercialization fee for every seed variety containing new traits developed using the licensed technology. Cellectis is also required to pay the University of Minnesota, in the aggregate, up to a low seven digit amount of milestone payments based on the net sales of licensed products in the agricultural field. Cellectis must also pay the University of Minnesota certain patent-related expenses for prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents. 
 The agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the licensed patents. The University of Minnesota may terminate the agreement upon advance written notice in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of Cellectis, and immediately upon written notice in the event that Cellectis challenges the validity or enforceability of any licensed patent in a court or other applicable authority. Cellectis and the University of Minnesota may terminate the agreement by written notice in the event of the other partys breach that has not been cured within a specified number of days after receiving notice of such breach. 
 License Agreement from Regents of the University of MinnesotaCRISPR 
 In December 2014, we entered into an exclusive license with the University of Minnesota, pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under a specified patent application and any patents that issue therefrom owned by the University of Minnesota relating to the use of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to make use, and commercialize products covered by the licensed patents in any field of use. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed technology and to manufacture, offer to sell, and sell licensed products as soon as practicable and to maximize sales. We must also achieve certain sales- and patent-related milestones. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we paid the University of Minnesota an upfront license fee payment in the amount of $130,000 in connection with entering into the agreement. We are also required to pay the University of Minnesota a tiered annual fee that increases from $20,000 to $225,000 based on the occurrence of certain specified events, including the grant of a sublicense to a third party, as well as patent-related expenses incurred under the agreement in prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents. We are also required to pay the University of Minnesota a certain percentage of all revenues received by us under sublicenses. If we undergo a change of control and wish to assign all of our rights and duties under the agreement, we must pay the University of Minnesota a specified transfer fee. 
 
23 


 Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue in effect until no licensed patent is active and until no licensed patent application is pending. The University of Minnesota may terminate the agreement for our uncured breach of the agreement upon 90 days prior written notice, or 60 days prior written notice if the breach relates to our payment obligations under the agreement. The University of Minnesota may also terminate the agreement, upon 10 days prior written notice, if we file for bankruptcy or become insolvent. The University of Minnesota may also immediately terminate the agreement if we or our agents or representatives commences or maintains an action in any court or before any governmental agency asserting or alleging the invalidity or unenforceability of the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the agreement for The University of Minnesotas uncured breach of the agreement upon 90 days prior written notice. We may also terminate the agreement at any time upon 60 days prior written notice. 
 License Agreement from Plant Bioscience Limited 
 In April 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Plant Bioscience Limited, or PBL, pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive, worldwide license to use and exploit certain gene-editing technologies related to wheat with endogenous resistance to powdery mildew, and to provide commercial development and technical services to third parties. The technology licensed to us was originally exclusively licensed to PBL by the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, or IGDB, which holds certain rights to which our exclusive license from PBL is subject. Pursuant to the agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain milestones in a specified development and commercial program, and to exploit the license so as to maximize the sublicensing of the licensed technology and the development and commercial use of the licensed products. 
 The agreement will expire on the later of the tenth anniversary of the date that sales of the licensed products first occurred or the last expiration of a valid claim of a licensed patent. We may terminate the agreement at any time for any reason by giving PBL written notice. PBL may terminate the agreement upon our material breach of the agreement that has not been cured within a specified number of days after receiving notice of such breach. The agreement will also automatically terminate if we become insolvent or bankrupt. 
 Commercial License Agreement with Two Blades Foundation 
 In December 2014, we entered into a commercial license agreement with Two Blades Foundation relating to TAL nuclease technologies, which was amended in 2016. Pursuant to the agreement, we granted Two Blades Foundation a non-exclusive license to TALEN technology for not-for-profit uses within the field of plants genetically engineered by TAL nuclease, including use in Two Blades Foundations humanitarian efforts to support subsistence farming, and for certain commercial applications related to Two Blades Foundations plant disease resistance programs. The intellectual property licensed to Two Blades Foundation was originally licensed to Cellectis by the University of Minnesota. In addition, pursuant to the agreement and subject to certain restrictions, we received a non-exclusive license under Two Blades Foundations TAL Code technology related to nucleases for commercial uses of TAL nucleases in certain specified crop plants. 
 The agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the licensed patents under the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party, or immediately upon written notice in the event that the other party, or its sublicensees or subcontractors challenges the validity or enforceability of any licensed patent in a court or other applicable authority. Either party may terminate the agreement by written notice in the event of the other partys breach that has not been cured within a specified number of days after receiving notice of such breach. In the event of termination of license agreement between the University of Minnesota and Cellectis with respect to the TALEN technology, our license from Two Blades Foundation will terminate. 
 Trademarks 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had two pending trademark applications in the United States.

 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 In the United States, the FDA and the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service, or FSIS, are primarily responsible for overseeing food regulation and safety, although as many as fifteen federal agencies also play a role in U.S. food regulation, including several other agencies within USDA. 
 USDA has regulatory jurisdiction over transgenic crops through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS. Under the Plant Protection Act, USDA requires anyone who wishes to import, transport interstate, or plant a regulated article to apply for a permit or notify APHIS that the introduction will be made. Regulated articles are defined as any organism which has been altered or produced through genetic engineering  which USDA determines is a plant pest or has reason to believe is a plant pest. The petition process can be a multi-year process that varies based on a number of factors, including APHIS familiarity with similar products, the type and scope of the environmental review conducted, and the number and types of public comments received. APHIS conducts a comprehensive science-based review of the petition to assess, among other things, plant pest risk, environmental considerations pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, or NEPA, and any potential impact on endangered species. If, upon the completion of the review, APHIS grants the petition, the product is no longer deemed a regulated article and the petitioner may commercialize the product, subject to any conditions set forth in the decision. If APHIS does not determine the product to be non-regulated, the product may be subject to extensive regulation, including permitting requirements for import, handling, interstate movement, and release into the environment, and inspections. 
 We have submitted petitions to APHIS for six of our product candidates to date: high oleic soybeans, high oleic/low linoleic soybeans, cold storable potatoes, reduced browning potatoes, powdery mildew resistant wheat, and improved quality alfalfa. We have received confirmation from APHIS for all six product candidates that APHIS does not consider such product candidate to be a regulated article under the Plant Protection Act. There can be no guarantee of the timing or success in obtaining nonregulated status from APHIS for our other crops or that the governing regulations will not change. Government regulations, regulatory systems, and the politics that influence them vary widely among jurisdictions and change often. 
 The FDA has jurisdiction to regulate more than 80 percent of the U.S. food supply. It derives its regulatory power from the FDCA, which has been amended over time by several subsequent laws. The FDAs oversight of food safety and security is primarily carried out by its Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. To execute its responsibilities, the FDA employs a team of more than 900 investigators and 450 analysts in the foods program who conduct inspections and collect and analyze product samples. The FDA typically does not perform pre-market inspection for foods. The FDA also regulates ingredients, packaging, and labeling of foods, including nutrition and health claims and the nutrition facts panel. Foods are typically not subject to premarket review and approval requirements, with limited exceptions. 
 For its part, the FDA regulates foods made with GMOs under its 1992 Statement of Policy: Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties. Under this policy, the FDA regulates foods derived from genetically modified plant varieties consistent with the framework for non-genetically modified foods. Under Section 409 of the FDCA, any substance that is reasonably expected to become a component of food is considered a food additive that is subject to premarket approval by the FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe, or GRAS. Companies are responsible for making an initial determination of whether a food substance falls under an existing food additive regulation, requires a new food additive petition, or is GRAS. A company may market a new food ingredient based on its independent determination that the substance is GRAS; however, the FDA can disagree and take enforcement action. The FDA offers a voluntary consultation process to determine whether foods derived from genetically modified plant varieties will be subject to these more stringent regulatory requirements. In most cases, however, foods derived from genetically modified plant varieties are not subjected to premarket review and approval processes. 
 
25 


 The FDA does not currently require manufacturers to label foods made with GMOs as such, but permits voluntary labeling pursuant to a 2001 guidance document. This policy has been the subject of pressure from consumer groups and there can be no guaranty that it will not change in the future. 
 Competition 
 The market for agricultural biotechnology products is highly competitive, and we face significant direct and indirect competition in several aspects of our business. Competition for improving plant genetics comes from conventional and advanced plant breeding techniques, as well as from the development of genetically modified traits. Other potentially competitive sources of improvement in crop yields include improvements in crop protection chemicals, fertilizer formulations, farm mechanization, other biotechnology, and information management. Programs to improve genetics and chemistry are generally concentrated within a relatively small number of large companies, while non-genetic approaches are underway with broader set of companies. Additionally, competition for providing more nutritious ingredients for food companies come from chemical-based ingredients, additives and substitutes, which are developed by various companies. 
 In general, we believe that our direct competitors generally fall into the following categories: 
 

 | Large Agricultural Biotechnology, Seed, and Chemical CompaniesOnly a limited number of companies have been actively involved in new trait discovery, development, and commercialization: BASF SE, Bayer AG, Monsanto Co., Syngenta AG, Takii & Company, LTD and DowDuPont Inc. Many of these companies have substantially larger budgets for gene discovery, research, development, and product commercialization than we do. Some of these companies also have substantial resources and experience managing the regulatory process for new genetically modified seed traits. Each of Monsanto, Syngenta, DowDuPont and Bayer also has significant chemical crop protection background and businesses. The trait pipelines of these companies are heavily weighted toward biotic stress traits, although they also have significant programs aimed at development of abiotic stress traits, and would compete with our farmer-centric agriculturally advantageous trait products. While these companies have internal programs that may compete with our own, they also seek new traits externally and, as such, some of them have been, and may in the future be, our partners.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Specialty Food Ingredient CompaniesCompanies focused on providing solutions to the food industry through chemical, synthetic, or other methods. These companies include International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Givaudan, Kerry Group plc, CSM N.V., FMC Corporation, CP Kelco, Novozymes, Ingredion Incorporated and Royal DSM N.V. These companies develop products that include chemical modification of food ingredients to achieve functional performance, such as chemical additives for food products. Such products currently do, and may in the future, compete with our consumer-centric food ingredient products. While these companies may produce products that directly compete with our own, some may in the future be our partners in developing healthier food ingredients for consumers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also believe that we may face indirect competition from trait research and development companies as well as agricultural research universities and institutions. Given the global importance of agriculture, there are a number of companies, research universities and institutions that specialize in research and development of agricultural yield and product quality traits. Companies such as Evogene Ltd., Ceres, Inc., and Keygene N.V., among others, are competitors in our field but typically focus on a limited number of traits, and do not generally have the product development, gene-editing technologies and regulatory infrastructure necessary to bring traits to market. Therefore, they typically outlicense trait technologies to large industry players with in-house development and regulatory capabilities at a relatively early stage of development. Most publicly funded research is focused on basic research programs that aim to understand basic biological processes and does not necessarily engage in further development and commercialization of discovered traits. While these programs are potentially competitive with us, we view them primarily as sources of innovation that fit with our business model. 
 
26 


 Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their R&D or collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, testing and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the plant science, specialty food ingredient and agricultural biotechnology, seed and chemical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through R&D and collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products faster, with lower research costs or with more desirable traits than we can.
