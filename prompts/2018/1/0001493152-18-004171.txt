Item 1. Business 
Introduction 
 
Jensyn Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on October 8, 2014 as a blank check company whose objective is to acquire, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, with one or more target businesses (a “Business Combination”). At December 31, 2017, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity through December 31, 2017 relates to the Company’s formation, the public offering described below, and search for an acquisition target. On November 3, 2017, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with BAE Energy Management, LLC and its owners, Victor Ferreira and Karen Ferreira. See “Proposed Business Combination” below.
Company History 
 
On March 7, 2016, we consummated our initial public offering (the “Public Offering”) of 3,900,000 units (“Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock, one right (“Right”) to purchase one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon consummation of an initial business combination (a “Business Combination”) and one warrant (“Warrant”) to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per full share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $39,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the Public Offering, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 275,000 Units to Jensyn Capital, LLC, an entity controlled by our insiders, and 19,500 Units to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, the representative of the underwriters of the Public Offering (“Chardan”), at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,945,000. The Units issued to Jensyn Capital, LLC and Chardan (the “Private Units”) consist of one share of Common Stock (“Private Shares”), one Right (“Private Right”) to purchase one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon consummation of a Business Combination and one Warrant (“Private Warrant”) to purchase one-half of one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per full share.
 
A total of $40,365,000 of the net proceeds from the Public Offering and the Private Placement were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the “Trust Account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay the Company’s franchise and income taxes, none of the funds held in the Trust Account will be released until the earlier of the completion of a Business Combination or the redemption of 100% of the Public Shares if the Company is unable to consummate a Business Combination within the required timeframe.
 
Under the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we had until the 18 month anniversary of our Public Offering to complete our initial Business Combination, subject to our right to extend such date by two additional three month periods by the deposit of an additional $200,000 into the trust account with respect to each three month period. On each of September 6, 2017 and December 6, 2017, Jensyn Capital, LLC, a company controlled by our initial stockholders, deposited a $200,000 extension fee in the Trust Account. In connection with each of these transactions, we issued unsecured promissory notes to Jensyn Capital, LLC which bear interest at a rate of 8% per annum and become due upon the completion of our initial business combination.
 
On March 5, 2018, our stockholders approved an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which extended the date by which we must complete our initial business combination to June 5, 2018. Stockholders holding an aggregate of 1,825,506 shares of common stock exercised their right to convert their shares into cash in connection with the extension. In addition, Jensyn Capital, LLC contributed an additional $.09 in the trust account for each public share that was not converted, leaving approximately $22,030,102 of cash in trust after giving effect to the conversions and the deposit. The deposit increased funds available in Trust Account for the conversion of shares in connection with a Business Combination or a liquidation from approximately $10.53 per share on March 5, 2018 to approximately $10.62 per share as of such date.

Proposed Business Combination
 
On November 3, 2017, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with BAE Energy Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“BAE”) and its owners, Victor Ferreira and Karen Ferreira (the “Existing Members”).
 
BAE is the parent company of Big Apple Energy and Vantage Commodities Financial Services. Big Apple Energy is an energy marketing aggregator and service provider within the retail energy sector. Vantage Commodities Financial Services is an innovative financing provider to small and medium energy service companies.
 
The material terms of the Purchase Agreement and the proposed business combination with BAE (the “BAE Business Combination”) are summarized below.
 
We will make a capital contribution to BAE of the funds in the Trust Account established at the time that we completed our Public Offering, less the amount needed to satisfy certain of our pre-closing obligations and amounts required to be paid to our public stockholders who elect to have their shares converted for cash as described below.
 
Upon the closing (the “Closing”) of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, we will own approximately 45% of BAE’s outstanding membership units (3,621,317 units) and the Existing Members will own approximately 55% of the outstanding membership units (4,400,000 units), subject to adjustment based upon BAE’s net working capital and indebtedness at Closing, the amount of transaction expenses incurred by BAE and the Existing Members, and the amount of the capital contribution that we make to BAE.
 
The Existing Members will be issued an additional 300,000 membership units in BAE (“BAE Units”) at Closing if the average volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of our common stock is between $12.00 and $13.00 per share during the ten trading days before the Closing, and 600,000 membership units if the average VWAP of our common stock during such ten trading day period is $13 or more per share.
 
If the adjustments contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, other than the VWAP-based adjustment, would result in the Existing Members of BAE owning less than a 51% interest in BAE after the Closing, then the amount of our capital contribution to BAE will be reduced so that the Existing Members will retain a 51% interest in BAE. The amount by which our capital contribution to BAE is reduced will be distributed post-closing to holders of our registered common stock as of the Closing.

The Existing Members of BAE will have the right to receive up to 2,000,000 additional units in BAE based upon the trading price of our common stock and the amount of dividends paid to the holders of our common stock during the 36 month period following the closing of the Business Combination. The Existing Members will be entitled to receive approximately 666,666 units in BAE for each of the three 12 month periods following the closing if the average closing price of our common stock exceeds the specified stock price target during any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period during each such 12 month period, or if the dividends paid during the period with the respect to our common stock exceed a specified cumulative dividend target. The stock price and dividend targets for such periods are outlined in the table below.
 

PERIOD | First 12 Months | | Second 12 Months | | | Third 12 Months 
-----------------------------+---------------------+-------+----------------------+---+-------+--------------------
STOCK PRICE | $ | 12.60 | | $ | 15.10 | | $ | 18.14
DIVIDENDS PAID PER SHARE | $ | 1.20 | | $ | 1.44 | | $ | 1.73 

 
The Existing Members initially will not receive a direct ownership interest in our company but will have the right to exchange their membership units in BAE for an equal number of shares of our common stock.
 
The Existing Members will be entitled to receive 50% of the proceeds that we receive from the exercise of warrants outstanding at the time of the closing of the BAE Business Combination.
 
At the time that we seek approval of the BAE Business Combination from our stockholders, we will offer our public shareholders the opportunity to convert their shares for cash upon the closing of the Business Combination in an amount equal to their pro rata share of the funds held in the Trust Account that holds the proceeds of our Public Offering as provided by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
 
The closing of the BAE Business Combination is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of our stockholders, our capital contribution to BAE being at least $15,000,000 and the receipt of required consents.
 
The senior management of BAE, including Victor Ferreira, its CEO, will replace our existing management team following the closing of the Business Combination. In addition, it is anticipated that at the time that we seek approval of the Business Combination by our stockholders, our stockholders will be asked to elect a new Board of Directors. The nominees are expected to be seven individuals designated by BAE, and none of such nominees will be an existing member of our Board of Directors.
 
We have filed a preliminary proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to a special meeting of stockholders to approve the BAE Business Combination.
 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 
General 
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business until we complete a Business Combination. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of the Public Offering and the Private Placement, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting our initial Business Combination. At this time we are not pursuing any Business Combination other than the BAE Business Combination. As a result of our limited resources, we expect to effect only a single Business Combination.
Fair Market Value of Target Business 
 
Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, our initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the funds in the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriter’s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial Business Combination. We believe that the BAE Business Combination meets this requirement. If we pursue a Business Combination other than the BAE Business Combination, we may structure a Business Combination with one or more target businesses whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the Trust Account balance. We may structure a Business Combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise owns or acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. We will not initially issue any shares of our capital stock in the BAE Business Combination; however, the Existing Members of BAE will have a right to exchange their Units on a one-for-one basis for shares of our common stock representing at least 51% of the shares of common stock outstanding after giving effect to such exchange.

Stockholder Approval of Business Combination 
 
In connection with the proposed BAE Business Combination, we will seek stockholder approval of the BAE Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders (but not our insiders, officers or directors) may seek to convert their shares of Common Stock, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination, into a portion of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account.
 
We will consummate our initial Business Combination only if public stockholders do not exercise conversion rights in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and a majority of our outstanding public shares of Common Stock are voted in favor of the business combination. As a result, we estimate that if stockholders owning approximately 36% or more of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Public Offering that remain outstanding exercise conversion rights, the BAE Business Combination will not be consummated. If we pursue a Business Combination other than the BAE Business Combination, the actual percentage will only be able to be determined once a target business is located and we can assess all of the assets and liabilities of the combined company (which would include the fee payable to Chardan in an amount equal to 2.0% of the total gross proceeds raised in the Public Offering as described elsewhere in this Annual Report, any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates in connection with certain activities on our behalf, such as identifying and investigating possible business targets and Business Combinations that have not been repaid at that time, as well as any other liabilities of ours and the liabilities of the target business) upon consummation of the proposed Business Combination, subject to the requirement that we must have at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets upon closing of such Business Combination. As a result, the actual percentages of shares that can be converted may be significantly lower than our estimates. We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial Business Combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the Trust Account upon consummation of such initial Business Combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial Business Combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Alternatively, we may not be able to consummate a Business Combination unless the number of shares of Common Stock seeking conversion rights is significantly less than the 36% indicated above. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial Business Combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait until after June 5, 2018 in order to be able to receive a portion of the Trust Account.
 
Our insiders, officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of Common Stock owned by them in favor of any proposed Business Combination, (2) not to convert any shares of Common Stock into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial Business Combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-Business Combination activity or (3) not sell any shares of Common Stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial Business Combination.
 
None of our officers, directors, insiders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase Units or shares of Common Stock in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed Business Combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed Business Combination, our officers, directors, insiders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, insiders or their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of Common Stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.
 
Conversion Rights 
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial Business Combination, including the BAE Business Combination, any public stockholder, whether voting for or against such proposed Business Combination, will be entitled to demand that his or her shares of Common Stock be converted for a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (approximately $10.63 per share as of March 29, 2018), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes. Alternatively, if we pursue a Business Combination other than the BAE Business Combination, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our Common Stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of his or hers, or any other person with whom he or she is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to 20% or more of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Public Offering. Such a public stockholder would still be entitled to vote against a proposed Business Combination with respect to all shares of Common Stock owned by him or her, or his or her affiliates. We believe this restriction will prevent stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares before the vote held to approve a proposed Business Combination and attempt to use the conversion right as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then current market price. By limiting a stockholder’s ability to convert no more than 20% of the shares of Common Stock sold in the Public Offering, we believe we have limited the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block a transaction which is favored by our other public stockholders.
 
None of our insiders, officers or directors will have the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial Business Combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-Business Combination activity with respect to any shares of Common Stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to the Offering or purchased by them in the Offering or in the aftermarket.
 
We may also require public stockholders who wish to convert, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent at any time through the vote on the business combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to stockholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement through the vote on the Business Combination to deliver his or her shares if he or she wishes to seek to exercise his or her conversion rights. Under Delaware law and our bylaws, we are required to provide at least 10 days advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a public stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders to deliver their shares prior to the vote on the business combination in order to exercise conversion rights. This is because a holder would need to deliver shares to exercise conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders to deliver their shares prior to the vote on the proposed Business Combination and the proposed Business Combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. Traditionally, in order to perfect conversion rights in connection with a blank check company’s business combination, the company would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her conversion rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the conversion price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the conversion rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become a “continuing” right surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a holder’s election to convert his or her shares is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed Business Combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his or her certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the proposed Business Combination not to elect to exercise such rights, he or she may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.

Liquidation if No Business Combination 
 
If we do not complete a Business Combination by June 5, 2018, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. At such time, the Rights and Warrants will expire, holders of Rights and Warrants will receive nothing upon a liquidation with respect to such Rights and Warrants, respectively, and the Rights and Warrants will be worthless. If we do not complete a Business Combination within the required time period, only holders of shares issued in our Public Offering will be entitled to receive redemption proceeds from the Trust Account, and it is likely that shares initially issued in private transactions will be worthless.
Competition 
 
If we succeed in completing a Business Combination with BAE, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from its competitors. We cannot assure you that if the BAE Business Combination is completed, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively. Information regarding BAE’s competition will be contained in the proxy statement mailed to stockholders in connection with the BAE Business Combination. Prior to completing a Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could complete a Business Combination with utilizing the net proceeds of the Public Offering, our ability to compete in completing a Business Combination with certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our obligation to convert shares of Common Stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination; 
● | our outstanding Rights, Warrants and unit purchase options, and the potential future dilution they represent; 
● | our obligation to ensure that if we enter into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in which we will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of the Common Stock will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into Common Stock basis (for instance, if the Business Combination would result in each share of Common Stock outstanding being exchanged for two shares of Common Stock, each right would result in the holder receiving two-tenths (2/10) of a share of Common Stock upon consummation of such Business Combination); 
● | our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commission to Chardan upon consummation of our initial Business Combination; 


6
-


● | our obligation to either repay or issue Private Units upon conversion of up to $1,700,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our obligation to register the resale of the shares of our Common Stock held by our insiders and their transferees (the “Insider Shares”), as well as the Private Units (and underlying securities) and any shares issued to our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and 
● | the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a Business Combination. 

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial Business Combination. In addition, if the Business Combination with BAE is not completed, it is unlikely that we will have sufficient time to negotiate and complete another Business Combination by June 5, 2018. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a Business Combination.
 
Facilities 
 
We currently maintain our principal executive offices at 800 West Main Street, Suite 204, Freehold, New Jersey 07728. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per-month fee (subject to deferral as described herein) payable to Jensyn Integration Services, LLC, a company controlled by our insiders, for office space, utilities and secretarial services. Our agreement with Jensyn Integration Services, LLC provides that commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and until we consummate a Business Combination, such office space, as well as utilities and secretarial services, will be made available to us as may be required from time to time. We believe that the fee charged by Jensyn Integration Services, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our current operations.
Employees 
 
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the Business Combination and the stage of the Business Combination process the Company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to consummate our initial Business Combination has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the Business Combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote an average of approximately 10 hours per week to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to consummation of our initial Business Combination.
