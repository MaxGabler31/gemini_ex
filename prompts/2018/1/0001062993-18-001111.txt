 Item 1. Business
INTRODUCTION 
 SunOpta, a corporation organized under the laws of Canada in 1973, is a leading global company operating businesses focused on a healthy products portfolio that promotes sustainable well-being. We are focused on sourcing non-genetically modified (non-GMO) and organic ingredients and manufacturing healthy food and beverage products. We operate an integrated field-to-table business model leveraging our global ingredient sourcing platform to process and market non-GMO and organic ingredients for retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice operators. We also manufacture packaged products focused on the high growth healthy beverages, healthy fruit and healthy snacks categories for our retail, foodservice and branded food customers. We believe we are a North American market leader in non-dairy organic aseptic beverages, premium refrigerated private label orange juice, individually quick frozen (IQF) organic fruit, healthy premium fruit snacks, and the global sourcing and supply of non-GMO and organic raw materials and ingredients. Our scalable global sourcing platform makes us one of the leading suppliers of non-GMO and organic raw materials and ingredients in the food industry, and provides us leading insights into emerging food and beverage trends. Our product portfolio is strategically aligned with the fast-growing consumer demand for high quality, healthy non-GMO and organic food and beverage products.
 Our vertically integrated business model makes us a preferred partner to our retail (e.g., grocery, mass, club, natural and specialty chains), foodservice and branded food customers. We deliver a diverse, innovative portfolio of high quality, food and beverage products supported by our global sourcing platform, scalable operating footprint, manufacturing expertise and commitment to innovation. This platform enables us to consistently supply our customers with a broad range of non-GMO and organic ingredients as well as high quality healthy food and beverage products that cater to the evolving demands of todays consumers. As a leading supplier of non-GMO and organic ingredients to the food industry, we leverage our insights into emerging consumer tastes and preferences to develop innovative new food and beverage products. 
 Our Product Portfolio
 Our diverse consumer products portfolio utilizes non-GMO and organic raw materials and ingredients that are sourced primarily by our vertically integrated global ingredients capabilities, and consists of three main commercial platforms:

 | Healthy Beverages  We offer a full line of aseptic beverages, including non-dairy beverages (including almond, soy, coconut, rice and others), broths, teas and nutritional beverages. We also offer refrigerated premium juices, shelf-stable juices and functional waters. We believe we are the leading North American provider of non-dairy organic aseptic beverages and premium refrigerated private label organic orange juice. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Healthy Fruit  We offer IQF fruit for retail (e.g., strawberries, blueberries, mango, pineapple, blends and other berries and fruit), IQF and bulk frozen fruit for foodservice (e.g., purées, fruit cups and smoothies), and custom fruit preparations for industrial use. We believe we are the leading North American provider of private label non-GMO and organic IQF fruit. 
 | Healthy Snacks  We offer fruit snacks (including bars, twists, ropes and bite-sized varieties) and roasted grain and seed snacks. We believe we are a leading North American provider of premium healthy fruit snacks. During 2017, we exited our flexible resealable pouch and nutrition bar product lines and operations, which were formerly part of the Healthy Snacks platform. 

 Our global ingredients platform is focused on the procurement and sale of non-GMO and organic grains and seeds (including ancient grains and seeds), fruits, vegetables, sweeteners, coffees, nuts and other products as ingredients in both raw material and processed ingredient forms. In addition to supplying ingredients for our own healthy food and beverage product portfolio, we are a leading supplier of raw materials and processed ingredients to a number of global food manufacturers and foodservice operators. Our vertically integrated model allows us to leverage our scalable and diverse supply of high quality non-GMO and organic ingredients, adding value to a product at multiple stages of the supply chain and delivering comprehensive non-GMO and organic food ingredients and packaged goods solutions to our customers evolving demands. This model allows us to generate additional revenue from our global ingredients customers by providing them with high quality healthy food and beverage products.
 Using our vertically integrated business model, we process non-GMO and organic food ingredients into consumer-packaged products. Our food ingredients are converted from raw materials, and our raw materials are sourced from approximately 5,000 suppliers encompassing approximately 10,000 growers in over 65 countries. Our employees and assets, which include 22 processing and packaging facilities, are principally located in North America and Europe with smaller sourcing and processing operations in Africa and China. Our operations and capabilities provide the flexibility to modify our product portfolio to adapt to the changing consumer needs for non-GMO and organic food and beverage products. As a general principle, we do not own or operate our own farms, retail stores, or extensively market our own consumer brands.

Our commitment and proactive approach to new product development and innovation drives our ability to introduce new higher margin food and beverage products to the market. The resources of our advanced innovation center in Edina, Minnesota, support our product development activities, with a dedicated team of food scientists, engineers and technicians, who proactively engage customers in creating and developing new products. Our innovation platform supports our leadership position in non-GMO and organic food and strengthens our relationships with our retail, foodservice and contract manufacturing customers. 
 Value Creation Plan 
 On October 7, 2016, we entered into a strategic partnership with Oaktree Capital Management L.P., a private equity investor (together with its affiliates, Oaktree). On October 7, 2016, Oaktree invested $85.0 million through the purchase of cumulative, non-participating Series A Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock) of our wholly-owned subsidiary, SunOpta Foods Inc. (SunOpta Foods).
 Following the strategic partnership, with the assistance of Oaktree, we conducted a thorough review of our operations, management and governance, with the objective of maximizing our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. As a product of this review our management and the Board of Directors developed a Value Creation Plan built on four pillars: portfolio optimization, operational excellence, go-to-market effectiveness and process sustainability. The Value Creation Plan is a broad-based initiative focused on increasing shareholder value through strategic investments made in the people and assets of the Company to deliver sustained profitable growth. We expect the Value Creation Plan to be implemented in phases, and span several years. 
 As part of the first phase of the Value Creation Plan, we are targeting implementation of $30 million of productivity-driven annualized enhancements of adjusted EBITDA, in the first phase of the plan, to be implemented over 2017 and 2018. During fiscal 2017, these adjusted EBITDA benefits were offset by expenses associated with the Value Creation Plan, including structural investments made in the areas of quality, sales, marketing, operations and engineering resources, as well as non-structural third-party consulting support, severance, and recruiting costs. The plan also calls for increased investment in capital upgrades at several manufacturing facilities to enhance food safety and manufacturing efficiencies. Over time, these investments are expected to yield additional improvement in adjusted EBITDA beyond the $30 million of initial productivity-driven savings. During 2017, we progressed against each of the four pillars of the Value Creation Plan and we believe we are on track to achieve targeted productivity enhancements, while continuing to make the necessary structural investments we believe will accelerate growth and drive long-term value. Progress on each of the four pillars of the Value Creation Plan is highlighted below: 
 Portfolio Optimization 
 The focus of the portfolio optimization pillar is to simplify the business, investing where structural advantages exist, while exiting businesses or product lines where we are not effectively positioned. Highlights include: 

 | Expansion project to add incremental freezing capacity, storage, and retail bagging capabilities to our Mexican frozen fruit facility (which we now wholly-own, following our acquistion of remaining non-controlling interests in July 2017). This project should enable diversification of the fruit varieties sourced from Mexico, and is expected to drive incremental cost savings, in addition to enhanced profitability from retail bagging capabilities. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Expansion project to add a second roasting and processing line at the our organic cocoa facility in the Netherlands. This expansion is expected to approximately double processing capacity in addition to adding new capabilities, all in support of increased demand and future growth opportunities in cocoa. 
 | Addition of a new oil processing line at our Bulgarian sunflower facility, which is expected to drive incremental margins through growth and production efficiency. 


SUNOPTA INC. | 6 | December 30, 2017 10-K 
-------------+---+-----------------------------


 | Investment into our roasted snacks capabilities at our Crookston, Minnesota, facility, which also involves the planned closure of our Wahpeton, North Dakota, roasting facility. This expansion is expected to be operational in the third quarter of 2018, which will support further growth of a variety of roasted grains and seeds. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Discontinuation of flexible resealable pouch and nutrition bar product lines and operations in the fourth quarter of 2017, and related closure of our Carson City, Nevada, nutrition bar processing facility. 
 | Consolidation of certain soy and specialty grain volume and closure of a grain-handling facility in Moorhead, Minnesota, in the third quarter of 2017, to enhance facility utilization and reduce operating costs. 
 | Closure of our San Bernardino, California, juice facility in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
 | Consolidation of our ingredients processing operations in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the related closure of a soy extraction facility located in Heuvelton, New York. 

 Since the initiation of the Value Creation Plan, we have implemented portfolio changes that are expected to yield approximately $7.9 million of annualized adjusted EBITDA benefits.
 Operational Excellence 
 The focus of the operational excellence pillar is to ensure food quality and safety, coupled with improved operational performance and efficiency. We expect these efforts to generate productivity improvements and cost savings in manufacturing, procurement and logistics. Highlights include: 

 | Advances in food safety and quality efforts across the entire manufacturing footprint. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Rollout of a new continuous improvement methodology (SunOpta 360) across our network of aseptic beverage facilities, which is helping to drive an expected 20% improvement in output from existing aseptic lines in 2018, in addition to enhanced production capabilities that will add new value-added non-dairy alternatives. 
 | Actions taken to right-size the incoming 2018 fruit crop, in connection with the implementation of new sales and operations planning (S&OP) tools within Consumer Products, which is expected to reduce storage costs and lower working capital, and operationally better prepare our frozen fruit operations for the start of the upcoming fruit season. 
 | Incremental counter-seasonal harvest opportunities enabled by the expansion of the Mexican fruit processing operations, allowing procurement to leverage lower cost sourcing alternatives. 
 | Continued identification and implementation of productivity initiatives focusing on manufacturing efficiencies, purchasing synergies and effective supply chain management. 
 | Working capital optimization efforts leading to a significant year-over-year improvement in operating cash flows. 

 Since the initiation of the Value Creation Plan, we have implemented process improvements and cost savings that are expected to yield approximately $6.9 million of annualized adjusted EBITDA benefits. 
 Go-To-Market Effectiveness 
 The focus of the go-to-market effectiveness pillar is to optimize customer and product mix in existing sales channels, and identify and penetrate new high-potential sales channels. We expect efforts under this pillar to improve revenue growth and profitability over time. Highlights include: 
 
 | Continued growth of the pipeline of commercial opportunities across all consumer product platforms, with a growing diversity of opportunities across categories and channels where we are currently under-represented. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Filling of the new position of Chief Customer Officer for Consumer Products, as well as hiring a new head of marketing. 
 | Addition of new commercial talent in the areas of sales, marketing, and research and development, which has furthered the development of control branded products that are expected to enhance access to the foodservice channel. 
 | Creation of a new foodservice distribution network, leveraging third parties, which will support our plan to grow and diversify penetration into the foodservice channel. 


SUNOPTA INC. | 7 | December 30, 2017 10-K 
-------------+---+-----------------------------


In 2017, we have implemented go-to-market improvements through strategic pricing actions expected to yield approximately $1.2 million of annualized adjusted EBITDA benefits. In 2018, efforts under the go-to-market pillar are focused on driving incremental sales volume.
 Process Sustainability 
 The focus of the process sustainability pillar is to ensure we have the infrastructure, systems and skills to sustain the business improvements and value captured from the Value Creation Plan. Broadening the skillset and experience of our leadership team is a critical component to the process sustainability pillar of the Value Creation Plan. Highlights include:

 | Filling the positions of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Information Officer, Chief Quality Officer, Senior Vice President of Operations and Engineering, and Senior Vice President of Supply Chain, as well as the appointment of a new General Manager to lead our Healthy Fruit platform. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Additional hiring of other management-level positions in the areas of sales, marketing, customer service, engineering, operations, quality, and other functional support services. 
 | Progress on an enterprise resource planning implementation project at the Mexican frozen fruit facility, with expectation that the new system to be operational during the second quarter of 2018. 
 | Restructuring of S&OP process and tools in the frozen fruit operations, which is expected to drive greater discipline and accuracy into the fruit pack plan, ensuring grower commitments are aligned with commercial demand. 
 | Addition of experienced plant and quality assurance managers in several facilities. 
 | Continued focus on customer service and working capital levels as S&OP processes and support systems are refined. 
 | Under new leadership, shifting the focus of the internal audit function towards value-added business process improvements that are designed to support and ensure we sustain improvements made as part of the Value Creation Plan. 

 In 2018, it is expected that the majority of future adjusted EBITDA benefits achieved under the Value Creation Plan will be focused on the operational excellence and go-to-market effectiveness pillars. 
 The statements we make in this Form 10-K about the expected results of the Value Creation Plan, including the timing for completion of measures undertaken, expected improvements in earnings, adjusted EBITDA, working capital efficiencies, expected cash flows, and expected costs, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K are based on certain factors and assumptions regarding expected growth, results of operations, performance, and business prospects and opportunities. While we consider these assumptions to be reasonable, based on information currently available, they may prove to be incorrect. Forward-looking statements are also subject to certain factors, including risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we currently expect. These factors are more fully described in the Risk Factors section at Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measures that management uses when assessing the performance of our operations. See footnote (3) to the Consolidated Results of Operations for Fiscal Years 2017 and 2016 table in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations at Item 7 of this Form 10-K for a discussion on the use of this non-GAAP measure and for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA from loss from continuing operations, which we consider to be the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.

 Global Ingredients 
 Operations and Product offeringsGlobal Ingredients
Global Ingredients aggregates our North American and international raw material sourcing and supply operating segments focused on the procurement, processing and sale of specialty and organic grains, seeds, fruits, grain- and cocoa-based ingredients, and other commodities, which are used primarily in applications serving the natural and organic food industry. Its operations are centered in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Edina, Minnesota; and Scotts Valley, California. 
 Global Ingredients sources raw materials, ingredients and certain grain-based food products from approximately 65 countries around the world, which include: 
 
 | Organic fruit- and vegetable-based raw materials and ingredients, sweeteners, cocoa, coffees, ancient grains, nuts, seeds and pulses and other organic food products. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Identity preserved (IP), non-GMO and organic seeds and grains including soy, corn and sunflower for food applications, with control maintained at every stage of production, from seed selection and growing through storage, processing and transportation. 
 | Seed- and grain-based animal feed and pet food products that originate from select organic and non-GMO soy, corn, sunflower and other commodities. 

 Global Ingredients also engages in processing and contract manufacturing services that include: 
 
 | Seed and grain conditioning services for soy, corn and sunflower. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Grain milling for corn, with various granulations and batch sizing. 
 | Coffee and sesame seed processing. 
 | Dry and oil roasting and packaging, including in-shell sunflower and sunflower kernels, corn, soy- and legume- based snacks. 
 | Liquid (concentrates and oil) and dried format seed, grain and cocoa based ingredients utilizing non-GMO and organic soy, corn, sunflower, rice, and cocoa. 
 | Specialty and organic functional ingredients, including maltodextrins, tack blends, flavor enhancing products, including snack coatings, cheese powders and flavor systems. 

 CompetitionGlobal Ingredients 
 Food ingredients are considered niche items often sourced, developed or processed for specific customers or industry segments. Global Ingredients competes with large seed, grain, raw material and specialty ingredient suppliers for customers and competes with other companies active in the international commercial seed, grain and raw material procurement market for supply. Its non-GMO and organic specialty products compete in the smaller niche commercial non-GMO and organic seed, grain and raw material markets. Key to competing in these markets is access to transportation, supply and relationships with producers. Competitors include major food companies with food ingredient divisions, other food ingredient and sourcing companies, and consumer food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food ingredients. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources, as well as production and marketing capabilities that are greater than our own. 
 
SUNOPTA INC. | 10 | December 30, 2017 10-K 
-------------+----+-----------------------------


The international organic food industry is very competitive due primarily to the limited worldwide supply of organic raw materials. Global Ingredients competes with worldwide brokers, traders and food processors for the limited supply of organic raw material ingredients. In many cases, it will enter into exclusive arrangements with growers and/or processors of key strategic commodities to control the reliability of its supply chain.
Distribution, Marketing, and SalesGlobal Ingredients
 As a leading provider of IP, non-GMO and organic, grains, seeds, grain- and cocoa-based ingredients, and other raw materials, Global Ingredients has well established sales and marketing capabilities, including technically oriented sales teams strategically located close to specific geographic sourcing and/or sales regions. Its specialty grains, seeds and other raw materials and ingredients are sold to food manufacturers and producers worldwide, including some of the largest U.S. consumer-packaged food companies. In addition, in our estimation, it maintains one of the largest organic raw material ingredient sourcing and supply networks in the world, working closely to develop and manage global organic supply and link these supplies with diverse customer needs. It also provides procurement and ingredient processing support to the Consumer Products operating segment.
 No customers accounted for more than 10% of revenues from our Global Ingredients segment in 2017.
 SuppliersGlobal Ingredients 
 Global Ingredients has an extensive established IP, organic soy, corn and sunflower grower network in North America, with many relationships existing for over 25 years. It also has a network of growers in Europe, South America, Africa and Asia. Because weather conditions and other factors can limit the availability of raw materials in a specific geography, it continues to focus on expanding production and sourcing capabilities to other parts of the world to ensure supply in years when local production is below normal levels. By diversifying supply, it also has the ability to divert available product based on market demand and customer requirements in order to maximize return.
 Organic raw material ingredient suppliers include growers, processors and traders of organic fruit- and vegetable-based ingredients, sweeteners and other food products. The diversity of our supplier base helps to ensure continual supply by providing contra-seasonal solutions to mitigate crop and quality risks. Organic food suppliers are required to meet stringent organic certification requirements equivalent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Organic Program, European Union (EU) standards, or others. 
 Consumer Products 
 Operations and Product OfferingsConsumer Products 
 Consumer Products provides healthy and organic food products that are primarily consumer-packaged to retailers, foodservice distributors and major global food manufacturers with a variety of branded and private label products. Consumer Products packaged food products are categorized into the following three main commercial platforms: 

 | Healthy Beverages
--+------------------


 | Aseptic beverages including almond, soy, coconut, rice and other non-dairy beverages, as well as adjacent categories such as broths, teas and nutritional beverages. Specializing in aseptic product offerings, Consumer Products produces a variety of pack sizes, including multi-serve and single-serve formats, all shelf stable with long shelf lives. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Organic and conventional beverage products, including shelf stable and refrigerated juices, specialty beverages, and functional waters. Consumer Products partners with third-party fillers to provide extended shelf life refrigerated packaging formats to its customers. 


SUNOPTA INC. | 11 | December 30, 2017 10-K
-------------+----+-----------------------


 | Our Healthy Beverage platform operates from an east to west network of three facilities, as well as co- manufacturing relationships that allow us to minimize distribution costs for our customers, maintain redundant back-up plans, and offer reliable, year-round programs. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Healthy Fruit
--+--------------


 | IQF natural and organic frozen fruits and vegetables, including strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, mango, peppers, broccoli, blends and many other items. Consumer Products produces a variety of packaging formats, including tubs, stand-up pouches, cups and polybags to address the needs of its retail and foodservice customers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Specialty fruit toppings and bases, which are custom formulated to provide unique flavor and texture profiles for a wide range of specialized applications. Applications include fruit bases for yogurts, ice creams, cheeses, smoothies, shakes, frozen desserts, bakery fillings, health bars, various beverages, dressings, marinades, dips and sauces, and fruit toppings for foodservice applications. 
 | Our frozen fruit operations consist of five facilities that extend from central Mexico to California, as well as a production facility in Kansas. Strategically our north to south footprint on the west coast allows us to maximize access to supply of fruit over the course of the full growing season, while our operation in the Midwest serves as a lower-cost launching pad to deliver product to the east coast. Our fruit ingredient operations are located in California. 


 | Healthy Snacks
--+---------------


 | Natural and organic fruit-based snacks in bar, twist, rope and bite size shapes, with the ability to add a variety of ingredients. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Our healthy snack platform maintains bi-coastal production which helps to minimize delivery costs to our customers. 

 CompetitionConsumer Products 
 Consumer Products healthy beverage and healthy snack offerings compete with major food manufacturing companies, as well as a number of other regional manufacturers. Its healthy fruit offerings face competition from both branded and private label fruit providers. It faces competition when securing fruit and vegetable raw materials; however, due to the location of its processing facilities, it is able to source these raw materials from a number of growing regions and suppliers. Integrated sourcing through Global Ingredients, which supplies a number of core raw materials, combined with in-house processing and packaging capabilities, provides Consumer Products with a low-cost advantage over many of its competitors. 
 Distribution, Marketing and SalesConsumer Products 
 Consumer Products supplies the private-label retail market, including large retailers and club stores, branded food companies, food manufacturers, foodservice distributors, quick service and casual dining restaurants located principally in North America. In addition, it markets branded food products under SunOpta-controlled brands, including Sunrich® Naturals and Pure Nature. Consumer Products generally conducts its business with customers on the basis of purchase orders and price quotations, without other formal agreements related to minimum or maximum supplies or pricing. 
 In 2017, Costco Wholesale, Starbucks Corporation and Walmart Inc. accounted for approximately 17%, 15% and 11%, respectively, of revenues from our Consumer Products operating segment and approximately 10%, 9% and 6%, of our consolidated revenues, respectively. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of revenues from our Consumer Products operating segment in 2017.
 SuppliersConsumer Products 
 Consumer Products raw materials are subject to the availability of fruit and vegetable supply, which is based on conditions that are beyond our control. Fresh and frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables are sourced directly from a large number of suppliers throughout the U.S., Mexico and globally, or through Global Ingredients. We believe our scale and location close to growing areas makes Consumer Products an attractive customer for fruit growers.
 
SUNOPTA INC. | 12 | December 30, 2017 10-K
-------------+----+-----------------------


Consumer Products also relies on its packaging suppliers to ensure delivery of often unique, portable, and convenient consumer packaging formats. In our aseptic packaging facilities, we specialize in the use of Tetra Pak equipment in a variety of pack sizes and also offer a variety of opening types and extended shelf life (ESL) options. Consumer Products also partners with third party fillers to provide ESL and refrigerated packaging formats to its customers. 
 Corporate Services 
 Our corporate headquarters is located in Mississauga, Ontario. In addition, centralized information technology, human resources, operations, research and development, legal and financial shared services groups are located in Edina, Minnesota. Employees of Corporate Services provide support services across the organization including management, finance, legal, operations, business development, information technology, research and development, human resources and administrative functions.
REGULATION 
 We are subject to a wide range of governmental regulations and policies in various countries and regions where we operate, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, throughout the rest of the EU, China and Ethiopia. Outside of the U.S., regulations concerning the sale or characterization of food ingredients vary substantially from country to country, and we take appropriate steps to comply with such regulations. These laws, regulations and policies are implemented, as applicable in each jurisdiction, on the national, federal, state, provincial and local levels. For example, we are affected by laws and regulations related to: seed, fertilizer and pesticides; the purchasing, harvesting, transportation and warehousing of grain and other products; the processing, packaging and sale of food, including wholesale operations; and product labeling and marketing, food safety and food defense. We are also affected by government-sponsored price supports, acreage set aside programs and a number of environmental regulations.
 U.S. Regulations 
 Our activities in the U.S. are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the USDA, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the Departments of Commerce and Labor, as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies. Various state and local agencies also regulate our activities. 
 USDA National Organic Program and Similar Regulations 
 We currently manufacture and distribute a number of organic products that are subject to the standards set forth in the Organic Foods Production Act and the regulations adopted thereunder by the National Organic Standards Board. In addition, our organic products may be subject to various state regulations. We believe that we are in material compliance with the organic regulations applicable to our business, and we maintain an organic testing and verification process. Generally, organic food products are produced using: 

 | agricultural management practices intended to promote and enhance ecosystem health; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | no genetically engineered seeds or crops, sewage sludge, long-lasting pesticides, herbicides or fungicides; and 
 | food processing practices intended to protect the integrity of the organic product and disallow irradiation, genetically modified organisms or synthetic preservatives. 

 After becoming certified, organic operations must retain records concerning the production, harvesting, and handling of agricultural products that are to be sold as organic for a period of five years. Any organic operation found to be in violation of the USDA organic regulations is subject to enforcement actions, which can include financial penalties or suspension or revocation of their organic certificate.

Food Safety, Labeling and Packaging Regulations 
 As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA and the FTC. This regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the U.S.
 State and local statutes and regulations may impose additional food safety, labeling, and packaging requirements. For instance, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (commonly referred to as Proposition 65) requires, with a few exceptions, that a specific warning appear on any consumer product sold in California that contains a substance, above certain levels, listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. We believe we are in material compliance with state and local statutes and regulations as they apply to our business. 
Environmental Regulations 
 We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state and local environmental regulations. Some of the key environmental regulations in the U.S. include, but are not limited to, the following: 

 | Air quality regulations  air quality is regulated by the EPA and certain city/state air pollution control groups. Emission reports are filed annually. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Waste treatment/disposal regulations  solid waste is either disposed of by a third-party or, in some cases, we have a permit to haul and apply the sludge to land. Agreements exist with local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified levels of Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and other constituents. This can require weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection. 
 | Sewer regulations  we have agreements with the local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified limits of BOD and TSS. This requires weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection. 
 | Hazardous chemicals regulations  Various reports are filed with local city/state emergency response agencies to identify potential hazardous chemicals being used in our facilities. 
 | Storm water  all facilities are inspected annually and must comply with an approved storm water plan to protect water supplies. 

Employee Safety Regulations 
 We are subject to certain safety regulations, including OSHA regulations. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations applicable to our business. 
 Canadian and Other Non-U.S. Regulations 
 Outside of the U.S., regulations concerning the sale or characterization of food ingredients vary substantially from country to country, and we take appropriate steps to comply with such regulations.
 In Canada, the sale of food is currently regulated under various federal and provincial laws, principally the federal Food and Drugs Act (FADA), Canada Agricultural Products Act (CAPA), and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA), along with their supporting regulations. Some of the key Canadian regulatory instruments include but are not limited to the following: 
 
 | Food and Drug Regulations (under the FADA)  food and drugs are subject to specific regulatory requirements, including composition (such as food additives, fortification, and food standards), packaging, labeling, advertising and marketing, and licensing requirements. New requirements regarding nutrition and ingredient labeling and food color were introduced on December 14, 2016. To the extent the new labeling requirements apply to products manufactured and sold by the Company, we will have a five-year transitional period to adopt them. Amendments dealing with food colour specifications and the removal of synthetic colour certification requirements came into effect immediately. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Organic Products Regulations, 2009 (OPR) (under the CAPA)  the OPR require mandatory certification to the revised national organic standard for agricultural products that are to be represented as organic in international and inter- provincial trade, or that bear the federal organic agricultural product legend (or federal logo). Except for certain exceptions and conditions, a U.S.-Canada Organic Equivalence Arrangement is currently in place whereby agricultural products produced and processed in conformity with the USDA National Organic Program are considered to be equivalent to the requirements of the OPR. 


SUNOPTA INC. | 14 | December 30, 2017 10-K
-------------+----+-----------------------


 | Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA)  the CCPSA provides oversight and regulation of consumer products with respect to manufacturers, importers, and retailers. It includes, without limitation, the ability to require product recalls, mandatory incident reporting, document retention requirements, increased fines and penalties, and packaging and labeling requirements. While the CCPSA does not apply to food, it does apply to its packaging with respect to safety. It is possible that there will be amendments introduced to the FADA, to capture the essence of the regulatory oversight found in the CCPSA. We have no way of anticipating if and when that may occur. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act (CPLA)  the CPLA and its supporting regulations outline requirements for packaging and labeling of products, including food products. The CPLA sets out labeling requirements relating to the description of the product, net quantity and dealer information, as well as packaging standards. The CPLA also includes a prohibition against false or misleading labeling. 
 | Canada Food Inspection Agency Act (CFIAA)  the CFIAA grants power to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (the CFIA), which is tasked with the administration and enforcement of certain Canadian food legislation. By virtue of the CFIAA and CAPA, the CFIA has the power to inspect and, if deemed necessary, recall certain products, including fresh fruit and vegetables, processed foods and organic foods, if the Minister believes that such products pose a risk to the public, animal or plant health. 
 | Processed Products Regulations (PPR) (under the CAPA)  the PPR regulates the grading, packing and marking of processed products that are produced in Canada for inter-provincial or export trade or imported into Canada. Under the PPR, processed food products are those that are prepared to assure preservation of the food product in transport, distribution and storage. The PPR establishes requirements with respect to the content, preparation, packing and marking of processed food products. 

 In January, 2017, the Government of Canada published the second version of its proposed Safe Food for Canadians Regulations (SFCR) under the authority of the Safe Food for Canadians Act (SFCA). Publication of the SFCR was accompanied by a 90-day public consultation period that ended on April 21, 2017. In January, 2018, the CFIA published a report summarizing submissions received pursuant to the proposed SFCR. The final regulations are expected to be published in the spring of 2018. If and when they become effective, the SFCR will consolidate 13 existing Canadian regulations and the food labeling provisions of the CPLA, and thereby establish a comprehensive set of regulations which govern all food sectors subject to CFIAA oversight, including federally registered sectors and food that is destined for import, export or interprovincial trade. Principal elements of the SCFR which are likely to impact the Company include licensing requirements for the import, export and interprovincial trade of food, traceability requirements, reporting requirements and timelines, preventative controls, an export certificate request process, prescribed container sizes and weights for certain products, labeling regulations and standards of identity and expansion of organic certification to service providers and additional products. The licensing requirements will be immediate for sectors such as meat, eggs and other previously federally registered sectors and up to three years for other sectors. 
 We are subject to Dutch and European Commission (EC) regulations and policies. Our European subsidiary, The Organic Corporation (TOC), is involved in the sourcing, supplying, processing, marketing, selling and distribution of organic food products and, as such, is subject to standards for production, labeling and inspection of organic products contained in EC Regulation 2092/91 (and its subsequent amendments). TOC is certified by Skal, the inspection body for the production (trading and selling) of organic products in the Netherlands. Products certified as organic by an EU-recognized inspection body, such as Skal, can be marketed within the entire EU. In addition, under the terms of an equivalency arrangement between the U.S. and the EU, organic operations certified to the USDA organic or EU organic standards may be labeled and sold as organic in both the U.S. and EU. 
 TOC is also affected by general food legislation both at EU and Dutch level relating to product safety and hygiene, among others. TOC is BRC Agents and Brokers certified in the Netherlands and manages a fully computerized system that manages the traceability of each product. In addition, TOC also considers and abides by EU and local legislation with regard to packaging and packaging waste. TOC is also subject to the regulations and policies of the countries outside of the EU in which it operates, including China and Ethiopia.

Our frozen fruit processing facility in Mexico is subject to Mexican regulations, including regulations regarding processing, packaging and sales of food products, labor relations and profit-sharing with employees. 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 Research and development and new product, process and packaging innovation are key priorities of our Company and initiatives are focused on continuous improvement of our existing product portfolios and continuing efforts to improve production process to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, as well as the development of innovative new products. Innovation is a key pillar for us and a necessity in the natural and organic foods categories. We believe our commitment and proactive approach to new product development and innovation is important to our ability to introduce new higher-margin food and beverage products to the market. 
 Our innovation center located in Edina, Minnesota, supports our product development team of highly trained and experienced food scientists and technologists that are dedicated to the research and development of new product offerings, as well as addressing product development opportunities for our customers. These opportunities include new and custom formulations, innovations in packaging formats, and new production processes and applications. Applications and technical support provided to our customers include all aspects of product development from concept to commercial launch, as well as ongoing manufacturing and processing support.
 We continue to develop new products to maximize the capabilities of our aseptic packaging facilities, including the development of non-dairy-based beverages that address the growing consumer demand for beverages that satisfy allergy concerns and provide a unique nutritional profile, as well as broths, teas and nutritional beverages. In addition, we continue to develop new fruit-based beverages, and fruit- and grain-based snacks, as well as innovative fruit ingredient systems for the dairy, foodservice and beverage industries. We are also continually looking to develop new value-added products for our customers that leverage our global sourcing platform.
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 The nature of a number of our products and processes requires that we create and maintain patents, trade secrets and trademarks. Our policy is to protect our technology, brands and trade names by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology relating to the development of our business in the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions, registering trademarks in the U.S., Canada and selected foreign jurisdictions where we sell products, and maintenance of confidentiality agreements with outside parties and employees. 
 Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our products, trade names and technology under U.S. and international patent laws and other intellectual property laws. We believe that we own or have sufficient rights to use all of the proprietary technology, information and trademarks necessary to manufacture and market our products; however, there is always a risk that patent applications relating to our products or technologies will not result in patents being issued, or, if issued, will be later challenged by a third party, or that current or additional patents will not afford protection against competitors with similar technology.
 We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how and confidentiality agreements to protect certain technologies and processes. Even with these steps taken, our outside partners and contract manufacturers could gain access to our proprietary technology and confidential information. All employees are required to adhere to internal policies, which are intended to further protect our technologies, processes and trade secrets. 
 PROPERTIES 
 We operate 22 processing facilities in seven U.S. states, as well as Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, and Ethiopia. In addition, we also own and lease a number of office and distribution locations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Europe, Ethiopia and China, and lease and utilize public warehouses to satisfy our storage needs. We also lease farmland that we sublease to fruit growers. For more details see Item 2. Properties, included elsewhere in this report. 
ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS 
 We believe that, with respect to both our operations and real property, we are in material compliance with environmental laws at all of our locations.

EMPLOYEES 
 As at December 30, 2017, we had a total of approximately 1,800 full-time employees (December 31, 2016  2,000). We also employ up to 1,700 seasonal employees in the U.S. and Mexico during peak fruit seasons each year. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages, slowdowns or other serious labor problems that have materially impeded our business operations. 
AVAILABLE INFORMATION 
 Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), are available free of charge on our website at www.sunopta.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such information electronically with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and applicable Canadian Securities Administrators (the CSA).
 Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below and elsewhere in this report. We believe the most significant of these risks and uncertainties are described below, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and our shareholders may lose all or part of their investment. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all possible risks or uncertainties applicable to our business. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report and in the other documents that we file from time to time with the SEC and the CSA.
Risks Related to Our Value Creation Plan, Significant Investors and Shareholder Activism 
 The implementation of our Value Creation Plan could pose a number of risks that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations 
 Following our strategic partnership with Oaktree, we conducted a thorough review of our operations, management and governance, with the objective of maximizing our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. As a product of this review, our management and the Board developed a Value Creation Plan built on four pillars: portfolio optimization, operational excellence, go-to-market effectiveness and process sustainability. The Value Creation Plan is a broad-based initiative focused on increasing shareholder value through strategic investments made to the people and assets of the Company to deliver sustained profitable growth. We expect the Value Creation Plan to be implemented in phases, and span several years. In connection with the Value Creation Plan, we are implementing a number of operational actions to improve our profitability and streamline our operations for long-term success. These actions may include rationalization or consolidation of certain of our operations or facilities, reinvestment in certain of our operations or facilities, investments in personnel, processes and tools, as well as other cost saving initiatives. These actions could consume capital resources and could also give rise to impairment and other restructuring charges that would be both cash and non-cash in nature, and these charges could be material.
 The implementation of the Value Creation Plan could have a material impact on our operations, strategy, governance, management and future prospects. For example, in 2016, we announced the closures of our San Bernardino, California, juice facility and Heuvelton, New York, soy extraction facility, resulting in impairment charges amounting to $13.2 million. Similarly, in 2017, we announced the exits from flexible resealable pouch and nutrition bar product lines and operations, as well as the consolidation of our roasted snack operations, resulting in impairment charges of $18.2 million relating to these assets. Certain actions that we take may lead to additional write-downs of assets and/or charges in future periods. In addition, we cannot predict whether the actions we take will achieve our goals of improving our profitability and financial performance and delivering long-term value to our shareholders. The ongoing implementation of our Value Creation Plan could expose us to a number of other risks, including the following:
 
 | distraction of management; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | difficulties in hiring, retaining and motivating key personnel as a result of uncertainty generated by the review and the implementation of any resulting recommendations; 


SUNOPTA INC. | 17 | December 30, 2017 10-K
-------------+----+-----------------------


 | difficulties in maintaining relationships or arrangements with customers, suppliers and other third parties; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | increases in general and administrative expenses associated with the need to retain and compensate business and recruiting consultants and other advisors. 

 The occurrence of any one or more of the above risks could have an adverse impact on our business, financial results, liquidity and financial condition.
 Our significant investors may have interests that conflict with those of our debtholders and other stakeholders 
 As at December 30, 2017, Oaktree held a 19.8% voting interest in the Company through its holdings of 11,333,333 special voting shares and 8,092,699 common shares of the Company. Oaktree has also nominated two members of the Board and is entitled to designate two nominees for election to the Board so long as it beneficially owns or controls at least 11.1% of SunOpta Inc.s common stock on an as-exchanged basis. If Oaktree beneficially owns or controls less than 11.1% but more than 5% of SunOpta Inc.s common stock on an as-exchanged basis, it will be entitled to designate one nominee. In addition, Engaged Capital has nominated one member of our Board.
 Oaktree is assisting us with our efforts to improve our operations, management and governance. Oaktrees objectives and perspectives as an equity investor in SunOpta may not always be aligned with those of other stakeholders, including our debtholders and smaller shareholders. 
 The interests of Oaktree and Engaged Capital, as well as their affiliates, may differ from the interests of our other stakeholders in material respects. For example, our large investors and their affiliates may have an interest in directly or indirectly pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their other equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to us, including risks to our liquidity and financial condition. Our large investors and their affiliates are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. They may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. 
 A concentration of ownership within our large investors could potentially be disadvantageous to, or conflict with, interests of our debtholders or smaller shareholders. In addition, if any significant shareholder were to sell or otherwise transfer all or a large percentage of its holdings, we could find it difficult to raise capital, if needed, through the sale of additional equity securities. 
 Our business could be negatively impacted as a result of shareholder activism or an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest 
 In recent years, proxy contests and other forms of shareholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies. If a proxy contest or an unsolicited takeover proposal was made with respect to us, we could incur significant costs in defending the Company, which would have an adverse effect on our financial results. Shareholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction and operations of the Company. Such proposals may disrupt our business and divert the attention of our management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. 
 Risks Related to Our Business
 Product liability suits, recalls and threatened market withdrawals, could have a material adverse effect on our business
 Many of our products are susceptible to harmful bacteria, and the sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury or illness to consumers. Such injuries may result from inadvertent mislabeling, tampering by unauthorized third parties, faulty packaging materials, product contamination, or spoilage. Under certain circumstances, we or our customers may be required to recall or withdraw products, which may lead to a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or result of operations. Our customers may also voluntarily recall or withdraw a product we manufactured or packaged, even without consulting us, which could increase our potential liability and costs and result in lost sales. A product recall or withdrawal could result in significant losses due to the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. In addition, a recall or withdrawal may cause us to lose future revenues from, or relationships with, one or more material customers, and the impact of the recall or withdrawal could affect our customersâ willingness to continue to purchase related or unrelated products from us, or could otherwise hinder our ability to grow our business with those customers. We could also be forced to temporarily close one or more production facilities. 

SUNOPTA INC. | 18 | December 30, 2017 10-K
-------------+----+-----------------------


For example, on May 3, 2016, we announced a voluntary recall of certain sunflower kernel products that have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes bacteria, and a number of our customers initiated recalls of their products that contain the affected sunflower kernels as an ingredient or component. Additionally, we ceased production at our roasting facilities for the period from April 21, 2016 until on or about May 15, 2016, while we put in place corrective and preventive actions. While we have recognized estimated losses of $47.5 million related to this recall, we may need to revise our estimates to be materially larger as we continue to work with our customers to substantiate the claims received to date and any additional claims that may be received. Consequently, we may not be able to determine the full extent of the losses related to the recall for some time and certain factors impacting these losses, such as our customers processes for developing their claims, the timing of submission of any such claims, and the terms of our customers insurance policies and related coverage, which are beyond our control. Revisions of our estimated losses and costs may occur at any time as we continue this process. 
 We have general liability and product recall insurance policies with aggregate limits of $47.0 million under which we expect to recover the sunflower kernel recall-related costs, less applicable deductibles. As at December 30, 2017, we had recognized recoveries up to the limit of the coverage available under our insurance policies. Consequently, to the extent any losses are excluded under the insurance policies or additional losses are recognized related to existing or new claims, these excluded or excess losses will be recognized as a charge to future earnings.
 Even if a situation does not necessitate a recall or market withdrawal, product liability claims might be asserted against us. If a product recall or withdrawal were to lead to a decline in sales of a similar or related product sold by a customer or other third party, that party could also initiate litigation against us. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities and those of our co-packers comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, if the consumption of any of our products causes, or is alleged to have caused, a health-related illness in the future, we may become subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or physical harm could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and consumers and our corporate and brand image. 
 Moreover, future claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. Further, we may incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage. A product liability judgment against us or a further product recall could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Food safety concerns and instances of food-borne illnesses caused by third parties could harm our business 
 Our internal processes and training may not be fully effective in preventing contamination of food products that could lead to food-borne illnesses. We rely on third-party suppliers and distributors, which increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents (such as e. coli, salmonella or listeria) could occur outside of our control and at multiple locations. If consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products or organic products generally, even in the absence of a recall or a product liability case, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Instances of food-borne illnesses, whether real or perceived, and whether or not traceable to our operations or a result of our actions or omissions, could cause negative publicity about us or the products we serve, which could adversely affect sales. Food safety concerns and instances of food-borne illnesses and injuries caused by contaminated products sold by third parties could cause customers to shift their preferences, even if no food-borne illnesses or injuries are traced to our products. As a result, our sales may decline. Loss of customers as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could harm our business.
 Litigation and regulatory enforcement concerning marketing and labeling of food products could adversely affect our business and reputation 
 The marketing and labeling of any food product in recent years has brought increased risk that consumers will bring class action lawsuits and that the FTC and/or state attorneys general will bring legal action concerning the truth and accuracy of the marketing and labeling of the product. Examples of causes of action that may be asserted in a consumer class action lawsuit include fraud, unfair trade practices, and breach of state consumer protection statutes (such as Proposition 65 in California). The FTC and/or state attorneys general may bring legal action that seeks removal of a product from the marketplace, and impose fines and penalties. Even when not merited, class claims, action by the FTC or state attorneys general enforcement actions can be expensive to defend and adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and consumers and our corporate and brand image, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to significant food and health regulations 
 We are affected by a wide range of governmental regulations in Canada, the U.S., Mexico and several countries in Europe, among others. These laws and regulations are implemented at the national level (including, among others, federal laws and regulation in Canada and the U.S.) and by local subdivisions (including, among others, state laws in the U.S. and provincial laws in Canada). We are also subject to regulations of the EU and the regulatory authority of regulatory agencies in several different countries. Examples of regulatory agencies influencing our operations include: the USDA, the FDA, the DHS, the EPA, the CFIA, and Skal, among others.
 Examples of laws and regulations that affect us include laws and regulations applicable to:
 
 | the use of seed, fertilizer and pesticides; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | the purchasing, harvesting, transportation and warehousing of seeds, grain and other products; 
 | the processing and sale of food, including wholesale operations; and 
 | the product labeling and marketing of food and food products, food safety and food defense. 

 These laws and regulations affect various aspects of our business. For example, certain food ingredient products manufactured by SunOpta may require pre-market approval by the FDA that the ingredient is generally recognized as safe, or GRAS. We believe that most food ingredients for which we have commercial rights are GRAS. However, this status cannot be determined until actual formulations and uses are finalized. As a result, we may be adversely impacted if the FDA determines that our food ingredient products do not meet the criteria for GRAS.
 In addition, certain USDA regulations set forth the minimum standards producers must meet in order to have their products labeled as certified organic, and we currently manufacture a number of organic products that are covered by these regulations. While we believe our products and our supply chain are in compliance with these regulations, changes to food regulations may increase our costs to remain in compliance. We could lose our organic certification if a facility becomes contaminated with non-organic materials or if we do not use raw materials that are certified organic. The loss of our organic certifications could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Our business is subject to the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA). PACA regulates fair trade standards in the fresh produce industry and governs our purchases of fresh produce and sales of frozen produce. We source fresh produce under licenses issued by the USDA, as required by PACA. Our failure to comply with the PACA requirements could, among other things, result in civil penalties, suspension or revocation of our licenses to sell produce and in certain cases, criminal prosecution, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Changes in any government laws and regulations applicable to our operations could increase our compliance costs, negatively affect our ability to sell certain products or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, while we believe we are in material compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations, we cannot assure you that we have been, or will at all times be, in compliance with all food production and health requirements, or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these requirements. Our failure to comply with any laws, regulations or policies applicable to our business could result in fines, lawsuits, enforcement actions, penalties or loss in the ability to sell certain products, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may require additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
 We have grown via a combination of internal growth and acquisitions requiring available financial resources. Our ability to raise capital, through equity or debt financing, is directly related to our ability to both continue to grow and improve returns from our operations. Debt or equity financing may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all. In addition, any future equity financing would dilute our current shareholders and may result in a decrease in our share price if we are unable to realize adequate returns. We will not be able to continue to fund internal growth and/or acquire complementary businesses within the natural and organic food industries without continued access to capital resources.

-------------+----+-----------------------


Impairment charges in goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
 As a result of business acquisitions, a significant portion of our total assets is comprised of intangible assets and goodwill. We are required to perform impairment tests of our goodwill and other intangible assets annually, or at any time when events occur that could affect the value of these assets. We may engage in additional acquisitions, which could result in our recognition of additional intangible assets and goodwill. If the financial performance of the acquired businesses is not as strong as we anticipate, we could be required to record significant impairments to intangible assets and/or goodwill, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 For example, in 2017, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $115.0 million related to the Healthy Fruit reporting unit of the Consumer Products operating segment, and, in 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $17.5 million related to the Sunflower reporting unit of the Raw Material Sourcing and Supply operating segment. 

 We operate in a highly competitive industry
 We operate businesses in highly competitive product and geographic markets in the U.S., Canada, Europe and various other international markets. We compete with various U.S. and international commercial grain procurement marketers, major companies with food ingredient divisions, other food ingredient companies, trading companies, and consumer-packaged food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food ingredients and other food companies involved in natural and organic foods. These competitors may have financial resources and staff larger than ours and may be able to benefit from economies of scale, pricing advantages and greater resources to launch new products that compete with our offerings. We have little control over and cannot otherwise affect these competitive factors. If we are unable to effectively respond to these competitive factors or if the competition in any of our product markets results in price reductions or decreased demand for our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
 Our customers generally are not obligated to continue purchasing products from us 
 Many of our customers buy from us under purchase orders, and we generally do not have long-term agreements with or commitments from these customers for the purchase of products. We cannot provide assurance that our customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our existing customer base. Decreases in our customers sales volumes or orders for products supplied by us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Loss of a key customer could materially reduce revenues and earnings 
 Our relationships with our key customers are critical to the success of our business and our results of operations. Our three largest customers accounted for approximately 24% of revenues for the year ended December 30, 2017. The loss, decrease or cancellation of business with any of our large customers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Consumer preferences for natural and organic food products are difficult to predict and may change 
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability and our customers ability to offer products that anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and appeal to their preferences on a timely and affordable basis. A significant shift in consumer demand away from our products or products that utilize our integrated foods platform, or a failure to maintain our current market position, could reduce our sales and harm our business. Consumer trends change based on a number of factors, including nutritional values, a change in consumer preferences or general economic conditions. Additionally, there is a growing focus among some consumers to buy local food products in an attempt to reduce the carbon footprint associated with transporting food products from longer distances, which could result in a decrease in the demand for food products and ingredients that we import from other countries or transport from remote processing locations or growing regions. Further, failures by us or our competitors to deliver quality products could erode consumer trust in the organic certification of foods. These changes could lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price decreases, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If we do not manage our supply chain effectively, our operating results may be adversely affected 
 Our supply chain is complex. We rely on suppliers for our raw materials and for the manufacturing, processing, packaging and distribution of many of our products. The inability of any of these suppliers to deliver or perform for us in a timely or cost-effective manner could cause our operating costs to rise and our margins to fall. Many of our products are perishable and require timely processing and transportation to our customers. Additionally, many of our products can only be stored for a limited amount of time before they spoil and cannot be sold. We must continuously monitor our inventory and product mix against forecasted demand or risk having inadequate supplies to meet consumer demand as well as having too much inventory that may reach its expiration date. If we are unable to manage our supply chain efficiently and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand, our operating costs could increase and our margins could fall, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Some of our operations are subject to seasonal supply fluctuations. For example, we purchase strawberries and other fruit from farmers during the peak California growing season, which occurs during the first two quarters of the year. As a result, our costs may be higher during these periods. We may not be successful in counteracting or smoothing out the effects of seasonality, and we expect that certain parts of our operations will continue to remain subject to significant seasonality.
 Part of our supply source also depends in part on a seasonal temporary workforce comprised primarily of migrant workers. Changes in immigration laws or policies that discourage migration to the U.S. and political or other events (such as war, terrorism or health emergencies) that make it more difficult for individuals to immigrate to or migrate throughout the U.S. could adversely affect the migrant worker population and reduce the workforce available for farms and production facilities in the U.S. Additionally, increased competition from other industries for migrant workers could increase our costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Volatility in the prices of raw materials and energy could increase our cost of sales and reduce our gross margins 
 Raw materials represent a significant portion of our cost of sales. Our cost to purchase services and materials, such as grains, fruits and other commodities, processing aids, and natural gas, can fluctuate depending on many factors, including weather patterns, economic and political conditions and pricing volatility. In addition, we must compete for limited supplies of these raw materials and services with competitors having greater resources than us. If our cost of materials and services increases due to any of the above factors, we may not be able to pass along the increased costs to our customers.
 We enter into a number of exchange-traded commodity futures and options contracts to partially hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on transactions to the extent considered practicable for minimizing risk from market price fluctuations. Futures contracts used for hedging purposes are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges. Our inventories, however, may not be completely hedged, due in part to our assessment of exposure from expected price fluctuations and an inability to hedge a number of raw materials.
 Exchange purchase and sales contracts may expose us to risks that a counterparty to a transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligation. We may be unable to hedge 100% of the price risk of each transaction due to timing and availability of hedge contracts and third-party credit risk. In addition, we have a risk of loss from hedge activity if a grower does not deliver the commodity as scheduled. We also monitor the prices of natural gas and from time to time lock in a percentage of our natural gas needs based on current prices and expected trends.
 An increase in our cost of sales resulting from an increase in the price of raw materials and energy could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our future results of operations may be adversely affected by the availability of organic and non-GMO ingredients 
 Our ability to ensure a continuing supply of organic and non-GMO ingredients at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control, such as the number and size of farms that grow organic and non-GMO crops, climate conditions, changes in national and world economic conditions, currency fluctuations and forecasting adequate need of seasonal ingredients. 
 The organic and non-GMO ingredients that we use in the production of our products (including, among others, fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains) are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, water scarcity, temperature extremes, frosts, earthquakes and pestilences. Natural disasters and adverse weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change) can lower crop yields and reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of organic or non-GMO ingredients or increase the prices of organic or non-GMO ingredients. If our supplies of organic or non-GMO ingredients are reduced, we may not be able to find enough supplemental supply sources on favorable terms, if at all, which could impact our ability to supply product to our customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could impose costs on our business 
 Our various food products, from seeds and grains to ingredients, fruits, vegetables and other inputs, are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including windstorms, hurricanes, floods, droughts, fires, temperature extremes and earthquakes, some of which are common but difficult to predict, as well as crop disease and infestation. Severe weather conditions may occur with higher frequency or may be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions could reduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Adverse weather conditions or natural disasters may adversely affect our supply of one or more food products or prevent or impair our ability to ship products as planned. These factors can increase costs, decrease our sales volumes and revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 A significant portion of our fruit supply is sourced from California, which experienced severe drought conditions between fall 2011 and fall 2015 due to extremely low levels of rainfall. Such conditions resulted in lost crops as well as increased water costs for growers in California. In particular, we depend on growers in California for strawberries. In January 2014, a drought state of emergency was declared in California and, among other actions, legislation was passed requiring monitoring of groundwater pumping, which limits the amount of groundwater for which farmers can drill. Strawberry growers are largely dependent on well water, and diminishing groundwater resources could lead to a reduced strawberry supply. In April 2015, statewide mandatory water conservation measures were imposed in California, including increased water use reporting by agricultural water users, enhancing the states ability to enforce against diversions and unreasonable use of water in an effort to curtail wasteful water practices in agricultural fields. Precipitation returned to more normal levels in 2016 and early 2017, and the drought emergency was lifted in April 2017. However, drought conditions are a recurring feature of Californias climate, and existing and future water conservation laws could negatively impact the agricultural industry in California and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 An interruption at one or more of our manufacturing facilities could negatively affect our business, and our business continuity plan may prove inadequate 
 We own or lease, manage and operate a number of manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage and office facilities. We may be unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of disasters, epidemics, business interruptions or other similar events. Some of our inventory and manufacturing facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather, and the production of certain of our products is concentrated in a few geographic areas. In addition, we store chemicals used in the equipment for quick freezing of fruit or used for cooling processes during ingredient processing, and our storage of these chemicals could lead to risk of leaks, explosions or other events. Although we have a business continuity plan, we cannot provide assurance that our business continuity plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue. Our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing. In the event that a natural disaster, or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of any of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time, or if harsh weather or epidemics prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to maintain our labor force at one or more of our facilities, we could experience delays in production or delivery of our products, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business 
 In the normal course of business, we rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. For example, our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs. Information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between, and storage of personal data of, our personnel, customers, consumers and suppliers depends on information technology. Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, as a result of updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, and other security issues. These events could compromise our confidential information, impede or interrupt our business operations, and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, litigation and reputational damage.

Our reputation and our relationships with customers, consumers and suppliers would be harmed if our systems are accessed by unauthorized persons 
 We maintain certain personal data, including personal data regarding our personnel, customers, consumers and suppliers. This data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. If a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm. While we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology, they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. Any data breach or other access of our systems by unauthorized persons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Changes in laws and regulations of privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business
We are subject to data privacy and protection laws and regulations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage and use of proprietary information and personally-identifying information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and data privacy varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is constantly evolving and increasingly demanding. The restrictions imposed by such laws continue to develop and may require us to incur substantial costs, adopt additional compliance measures, such as notification requirements and corrective actions in the event of a security breach, and/or change our current or planned business models. We are already subject to strict data privacy laws in the European Union and other jurisdictions governing the collection, transmission, storage and use of employee data and personally-identifying information. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), coming into effect in Europe in May 2018, creates a range of new compliance obligations and increases financial penalties for non-compliance and extends the scope of the European Union data protection law to all companies processing data of European Union residents, regardless of the companys location. The GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Such regulations increase our compliance and administrative burden significantly. While we have developed and are executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and do not currently foresee significant obstacles that would prevent timely compliance, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect implementation. 
 If our current security measures and data protection policies and controls are found to be non-compliant with relevant laws or regulations in any jurisdiction where we conduct business, we may be subject to penalties and fines, and may need to expend significant resources to implement additional data protection measures. In addition, we may be required to modify the features and functionality of our system offerings in a way that is less attractive to customers. 
 If we lose the services of our key management, our business could suffer 
 Our prospects depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our key executives, and our continued growth depends on our ability to identify, recruit and retain key management personnel. We are also dependent on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate our personnel. We do not typically carry key person life insurance on our executive officers. If we lose the services of our key management or fail to identify, recruit and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted.
 If we face labor shortages or increased labor costs, our results of operations and our growth could be adversely affected 
 Labor is a significant component of the cost of operating our business. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors, such as employment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and governmental labor and employment requirements. In the event of increasing wage rates, if we fail to increase our wages competitively, the quality of our workforce could decline, while increasing our wages could cause our earnings to decrease. If we face labor shortages or increased labor costs because of increased competition for employees from our competitors and other industries, higher employee-turnover rates, unionization of farm workers or increases in the federal- or state-mandated minimum wage, change in exempt and non-exempt status, or other employee benefits costs (including costs associated with health insurance coverage or workers compensation insurance), our operating expenses could increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Technological innovation by our competitors could make our food products less competitive
 Our competitors include major food ingredient and consumer-packaged food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food and food ingredients. Many of these companies are engaged in the development of food ingredients and other packaged food products and frequently introduce new products into the market. Existing products or products under development by our competitors could prove to be more effective or less costly than our products, which could have a material adverse effect on the competitiveness of our products and our business. 
 We rely on protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights
 Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies. Our policy is to protect our technology by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology relating to the development of our business in the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions.
 Our trademarks and brand names are registered in the U.S., Canada and other jurisdictions. We intend to keep these filings current and seek protection for new trademarks to the extent consistent with business needs. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how and confidentiality agreements to protect certain of the technologies and processes that we use.
 The failure of any patents, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights to provide protection to our technologies would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, which could result in lower sales or gross margins. 
 Changes in laws or regulations governing foreign trade or taxation could adversely affect our business 
 Changes in governmental laws or regulations affecting foreign trade or taxation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations, may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or those of our customers or suppliers. Such changes could increase the costs of doing business for the Company, our customers, or suppliers, or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. 
 The current President of the United States has expressed an intention to change existing trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Any changes to NAFTA could impact our Mexican and Canadian operations. Changes in U.S. political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade with countries where we or our customers operate, in particular Canada, Mexico and Europe, could adversely affect our operating results and our business. 
 Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The U.S. recently enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. In addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. 
 Our operations are influenced by agricultural policies 
 We are affected by governmental agricultural policies such as price supports and acreage set aside programs and these types of policies may affect our business. The production levels, markets and prices of the grains and other raw products that we use in our business are materially affected by government programs, which include acreage control and price support programs of the USDA. Revisions in these and other comparable programs, in the U.S. and elsewhere, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations. 
 We are subject to substantial environmental regulation and policies 
 We are, and expect to continue to be, subject to substantial federal, state, provincial and local environmental regulation. Some of the key environmental regulations to which we are subject include air quality regulations of the EPA and certain city, state and provincial air pollution control groups, waste treatment/disposal regulations, sewer regulations under agreements with local city sewer districts, regulations governing hazardous substances, storm water regulations and bioterrorism regulations. For a more detailed summary of the environmental regulations and policies to which we are subject, see Item 1. BusinessRegulation of this report. Our business also requires that we have certain permits from various state, provincial and local authorities related to air quality, storm water discharge, solid waste, land spreading and hazardous waste.

In the event that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of potentially hazardous materials in certain of our businesses were to fail, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any such liability could exceed our resources. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future. In addition, changes to environmental regulations may require us to modify our existing plant and processing facilities and could significantly increase the cost of those operations.
 The foregoing environmental regulations, as well as others common to the industries in which we participate, can present delays and costs that can adversely affect business development and growth. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any changes to current regulations may impact the development, manufacturing and marketing of our products, and may have a negative impact on our future results. 
 Climate change laws could have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
 Legislative and regulatory authorities in the U.S., Canada and internationally will likely continue to consider numerous measures related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. In order to produce, manufacture and distribute our products, we and our suppliers use fuels, electricity and various other inputs that result in the release of greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns about the environmental impacts of greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change may result in environmental taxes, charges, regulatory schemes, assessments or penalties, which could restrict or negatively impact our operations, as well as those of our suppliers, who would likely pass all or a portion of their costs along to us. We may not be able to pass any resulting cost increases along to our customers. Any laws or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change laws enacted by the U.S., Canada or any other international jurisdiction where we conduct business could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity 
 We are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as our non-U.S.-based operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes and we also sell product in currencies that are different from the currency used to purchase materials, or process finished goods. We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a significant portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates. We are exposed to price fluctuations on a number of commodities as we hold inventory and enter into transactions to buy and sell products in a number of markets. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures about these risks can be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this report. As a result of these exposures, fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodities could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
 Our international operations expose us to additional risks 
 We source our products from numerous suppliers and growers from around the world. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, we have processing, packaging and warehousing facilities in Mexico, Europe, Africa and Asia. Our international operations and customers expose us to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:
 
 | exposure to local economic conditions, expropriation and nationalization, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; 
 | investment restrictions or requirements; 
 | export and import restrictions; 
 | compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; 
 | compliance with export controls and economic sanctions laws; 


SUNOPTA INC. | 27 | December 30, 2017 10-K
-------------+----+-----------------------


 | increases in working capital requirements related to long supply chains; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | disruptions in our supply chain from unforeseen events, such as natural disasters, terrorism and political and civil unrest. 

 For example, we have significant operations in Mexico, including a facility in the State of Michoacán, near areas where there have been incidents of unrest, which may heighten the risks of our international operations described above.
 As we continue to expand our business globally, we may have difficulty anticipating and effectively managing these and other risks that our international operations may face, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any acquisition of businesses with operations outside of the U.S. and Canada may exacerbate this risk.
 A significant portion of our assets and certain of our executive officers and directors are located outside of the U.S.; it may be difficult to effect service of process and enforce legal judgments upon us and certain of our executive officers and directors
 A significant portion of our assets and certain of our executive officers and directors are located outside of the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the U.S. and enforce judgment of a U.S. court obtained against us or our executive officers and directors. Particularly, our stakeholders may not be able to:
 
 | effect service of process within the U.S. on us or certain of our executive officers and directors; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against us or certain of our executive officers and directors based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws; 
 | enforce, in a court outside of the U.S., judgments of U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws; or 
 | bring an original action in a court outside of the U.S. to enforce liabilities against us or any of our executive officers and directors based upon the U.S. federal securities laws. 

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 
 Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 
 Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including, without limitation, impairing our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other general corporate purposes. In addition, we will have to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal, premium (if any) and interest on our indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes. If we do not generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Our level of indebtedness will also make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions, and may compromise our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures as compared to our competitors. 
 Our debt and equity agreements restrict how we may operate our business, and our business may be materially and adversely affected if these restrictions prevent us from implementing our business plan 
 The agreements governing our debt and preferred equity instruments contain restrictive covenants that limit the discretion of our management with respect to certain business matters. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to obtain additional debt financing, to create other liens, to complete a merger, amalgamation or consolidation, to make certain distributions or make certain payments, investments and guarantees and to sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets. These restrictions may hinder our ability to execute on our growth strategy or prevent us from implementing parts of our business plan.

Our business may be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to renew the Global Credit Facility and/or refinance our senior secured second lien notes
The Global Credit Facility matures on February 10, 2021. We may not be able to renew this facility to the same level or size, or on terms as favorable as at present. A reduced facility may impact our ability to finance our business, requiring us to scale back our operations and our use of working capital. Alternatively, obtaining credit on less favorable terms would have a direct impact on our profitability and operating flexibility. Our senior secured second lien notes mature on October 9, 2022. Our ability to refinance these notes upon maturity will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. As a result, we may not be able to obtain refinancing at commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Alternatively, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments, or seeking to raise additional capital. 
 Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to meet the financial covenants of the Global Credit Facility
Our ability to comply with the financial covenants under the Global Credit Facility agreement will depend on the success of our businesses, our operating results, and our ability to achieve our financial forecasts. Various risks uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the financial covenants and terms of the Global Credit Facility agreement. Failure to comply with our financial covenants and other terms could result in an event of default and the acceleration of amounts owing under this agreement, unless we are able to negotiate a waiver. The lenders could condition any such waiver on an amendment to the agreement on terms (including, but not limited to, the payment of consent fees) that may be unfavorable to us. If we are unable to negotiate a covenant waiver or replace or refinance the Global Credit Facility agreement on favorable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely impacted. 
 Risks Related to Business Acquisitions and Divestures 
 We may not be able to effectively manage our growth and integrate acquired companies 
 From time to time we may pursue acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our overall growth strategy. In October 2015, for example, we completed the acquisition of Sunrise Holdings (Delaware), Inc., which was the largest acquisition in the history of our company. Our ability to effectively integrate past or future business acquisitions, including our ability to realize potentially available marketing opportunities and cost savings in a timely and efficient manner will have a direct impact on our future results. We may encounter problems in connection with the integration of any new businesses, such as challenges relating to the following:

 | integration of an acquired companys products into our product mix; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | the amount of cost savings that may be realized as a result of integrating an acquired product or business; 
 | unanticipated quality and production issues with acquired products; 
 | adverse effects on business relationships with suppliers and customers; 
 | diversion of management attention; 
 | integrating acquired operations that have management teams and company cultures that differ from our own; 
 | difficulty with personnel and loss of key employees; 
 | implementation of an integrated enterprise-wide accounting and information system and consolidation of back office accounting; 
 | compatibility of financial control and information systems; 
 | exchange rate risk with respect to acquisitions outside the U.S.; 


SUNOPTA INC. | 29 | December 30, 2017 10-K
-------------+----+-----------------------


 | potential for patent and trademark claims or other litigation against or involving the acquired company; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | integration of businesses that operate in new geographic areas, including difficulties in identifying and gaining access to customers in new markets; and 
 | in the case of foreign acquisitions, uncertainty regarding foreign laws and regulations and difficulty integrating operations and systems as a result of cultural, systems and operational differences. 

 If we experience any of these problems in the integration of acquisitions, they could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We may not have accurately estimated the benefits or synergies to be realized from business acquisitions 
 Our expected benefits and synergies from acquired businesses may not be realized if our cash flow estimates associated with the assets of those businesses are materially inaccurate or if we fail to identify operating problems or liabilities prior to acquisition. We perform inspections of the assets to be acquired, which we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. However, the accuracy of our assessments of the assets and our estimates are inherently uncertain. There could also be environmental or other problems that were not discovered in the course of our due diligence and inspections. If problems or risks are identified after the closing of an acquisition, there may be limited recourse against the former owners.
 Business acquisitions may expose us to unknown liabilities 
 When we acquire a business, we often assume or otherwise become subject to liabilities of acquired businesses, including contingent liabilities that may depend on the outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or other events. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities that are unknown to us or that cannot be quantified at the time of the acquisition. If we become subject to significant liabilities or other obligations as a result of an acquisition, our business could be materially affected. Moreover, to the extent we have contractual rights to indemnification against losses and liabilities of businesses we acquire, the amount of indemnification available could be limited and may not be sufficient to cover the actual losses we suffer.
 Business acquisitions could result in unexpected disruptions of our business 
 In response to an acquisition, the customers may cease or reduce their business with the combined company, which could negatively affect our business. Similarly, current or prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. This may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management, marketing and technical personnel. In addition, the diversion of the attention of our respective management teams away from day-to-day operations during the pendency of the business acquisition could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. 
 The possible future divestiture of businesses could impact our profitability
 We may, from time to time, divest businesses that are no longer a strategic fit or no longer meet our growth or profitability targets. Our profitability may be impacted by gains or losses on the sales of such businesses, or lost operating income or cash flows from such businesses. Additionally, we may be required to record asset impairment or restructuring charges related to divested businesses, or indemnify buyers for liabilities, which may reduce our profitability and cash flows. For example, in 2017 and 2016, we recognized asset impairment and facility closure costs of $33.3 million, as well as related employee termination costs of $8.4 million, in connection with portfolio optimization measures taken under the Value Creation Plan, including the exits from flexible resealable pouch and nutrition bar product lines and operations. We may also not be able to negotiate such divestitures on terms acceptable to us. Such potential divestitures will require management resources and may divert managements attention from our day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in divesting such businesses, our business could be harmed. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Shares 
 Our operating results and share price are subject to significant volatility 
 Our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to:
 
 | changes in our customers and/or their demand;
--+----------------------------------------------


SUNOPTA INC. | 30 | December 30, 2017 10-K

 | managements ability to execute our business strategies focused on improved operating earnings; 
 | organizational and personnel changes; 
 | interruption in operations at our facilities; 
 | product recalls or market withdrawals; 
 | legal and administrative cases (whether civil, such as environmental or product related, or criminal), settlements, judgments and investigations; 
 | foreign currency fluctuations; 
 | supply shortages or commodity price fluctuations; and 
 | general economic conditions. 

 In addition, our share price may be highly volatile compared to larger public companies. Certain announcements could have a significant effect on our share price, including announcements regarding:
 
 | fluctuations in financial performance from period to period; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | mergers, acquisitions and/or divestitures, either by us or key competitors; 
 | changes in key personnel; 
 | strategic partnerships or arrangements; 
 | litigation and governmental inquiries; 
 | changes in governmental regulation and policy; 
 | patents or proprietary rights; 
 | changes in consumer preferences and demand; 
 | new financings; and 
 | general market conditions. 

 Higher volatility increases the chance of larger than normal price swings which reduces predictability in the price of our common shares and could impair investment decisions. In addition, price and volume trading volatility in the stock markets can have a substantial effect on our share price, frequently for reasons other than our operating performance. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
 Periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a companys securities, is often followed by securities class action litigation alleging material misstatements or omissions in disclosures provided to shareholders. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources.
 Our debt instruments restrict, and our future debt instruments may restrict, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, and we do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future; therefore, our shareholders may not be able to receive a return on their common shares until their shares are sold 
 We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common shares. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future because, among other reasons, we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth of our business. In addition, the covenants included in our debt instruments, and the covenants to be included in our future debt instruments may restrict our ability to receive cash from our subsidiaries and pay dividends on our common shares. The future payment of dividends will be dependent on factors such as these covenant restrictions, cash on hand, or achieving and maintaining profitability, the financial requirements to fund growth, our general financial condition and other factors the Board may consider appropriate in the circumstances. Until we pay dividends, which we may never do, our shareholders will not receive a return on their common shares until their shares are sold.

The future issuance of additional common shares in connection with the exchange of convertible preferred stock, exercise of stock options, participation in our employee stock purchase plan and issuance of additional securities could dilute the value of our common shares 
 We have unlimited common shares authorized but unissued. Our articles of amalgamation authorize us to issue these common shares, and we may also issue options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to common shares for consideration and on terms and conditions established by the Board in its sole discretion.
 The exchange of outstanding convertible preferred stock, exercise of stock-based awards, participation in our employee stock purchase plan, and issuance of additional securities in connection with acquisitions or otherwise could result in dilution in the value of our common shares and the voting power represented thereby. Furthermore, to the extent common shares are issued pursuant to the exchange of outstanding convertible preferred stock, exercise of stock-based awards, participation in our employee stock purchase plan and issuance of additional securities, our share price may decrease due to the additional amount of common shares available in the market. The subsequent sales of these shares could encourage short sales by our shareholders and others, which could place further downward pressure on our share price. Moreover, the holders of our stock options may hedge their positions in our common shares by short selling our common shares, which could further adversely affect our stock price.
 If securities or industry research analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common shares, our share price and trading volume could decline
 The trading market for our common shares relies in part on the research and reports that securities and industry research analysts publish about us, our industry, our competitors and our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. Our share price and trading volumes could decline if one or more securities or industry analysts downgrade our common shares, issue unfavorable commentary about us, our industry or our business, cease to cover our Company or fail to regularly publish reports about us, our industry or our business.
