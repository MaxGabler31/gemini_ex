General 
 
Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Provectus” or “the Company”) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a new class of drugs based on halogenated xanthenes, such as Rose Bengal (4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-2’,4’,5’,7’-tetraiodofluorescein). Intralesional PV-10, the first small molecule oncolytic immunotherapy, which can induce immunogenic cell death, is undergoing clinical study for adult solid tumor cancers, like melanoma and gastrointestinal (“GI”) cancers, and preclinical study for pediatric cancers. Topical PH-10 is undergoing clinical study for inflammatory dermatoses, like psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. For psoriasis, pathways significantly improved include published psoriasis transcriptomes and cellular responses mediated by IL-17, IL-22, and interferons.
 
Our approach to drug development comprises two related, complementary, clinical development program paths based on the features of our investigational drugs and their clinically rational applicability to different patient populations. In solid tumor cancers for adults, for example, we believe PV-10 has important implications as a single agent for earlier states of disease (i.e., locally advanced disease, or Stage III or earlier), while the combination of PV-10 with other classes of therapy or therapeutic agent (e.g., chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy) is more appropriate for more advanced disease states (i.e., widely metastatic disease, or Stage IV).


The table below sets forth our progress in developing our two investigational drug candidates and for the indications shown:

Oncology (PV-10)
 
We are developing PV-10, an injectable formulation of rose bengal disodium (Rose Bengal), for direct injection into tumors as an investigational oncolytic immunotherapy, where it may (a) destroy injected tumors (“oncolytic”) and (b) elicit an anti-tumor immune response via the adaptive immune system (“immunotherapy”).
Locally Advanced and Widely Metastatic Melanoma
 
Our pivotal Phase 3 randomized controlled trial of intralesional PV-10 as single-agent treatment for locally advanced cutaneous melanoma (Stage IIIB-IV M1a), compared to standard therapy (i.e., investigator’s choice of intralesional oncolytic viral therapy or systemic chemotherapy), opened to enrollment in 2015. During 2017, we recruited patients at trial sites in the U.S., Italy, and Germany, By the end of 2017, we had regulatory approval to open sites in France and Mexico, and also were in the process of opening sites there. The primary outcome measure of the study is progression-free survival assessed every 12 weeks for up to 18 months. Secondary outcome measures include complete response rate and its duration, and overall survival, all also assessed every 12 weeks up to 18 months. For those patients with more advanced melanoma that is not fully accessible to injection (Stage IV M1a-c), we are assessing PV-10 in combination with checkpoint inhibitor KEYTRUDA in a Phase 1b/2 clinical study. This study is the result of mechanism of action work on PV-10 showing that it may be complementary to checkpoint inhibition. Preliminary data from the Phase 1b study portion were reported at the Society for Melanoma Research annual meeting in Brisbane, Australia in October 2017. The data demonstrated no compounding of safety risk for the combination (the Phase 1b primary endpoint) and likely synergy of efficacy (the Phase 1b secondary endpoint).
 
Mechanism of action and other work previously reported by our research collaborators at Moffitt Cancer Center, in Tampa, Florida (Toomey et al., PLOS ONE 2013: 8(7); e68561, Liu et al., Oncotarget 2016; 7: 37893, and Pilon-Thomas et al., Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer 2016; 4(Suppl 1): 73) and reported in February 2017 by our research collaborators at the University of Illinois at Chicago (Qin et al., Cell Death and Disease 2017; 8: e2584) indicate that PV-10 functions as an oncolytic immunotherapy in laboratory models of multiple tumor types: melanoma, breast carcinoma, colon cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Both groups of collaborators definitively classify PV-10 as an oncolytic immunotherapy capable of yielding immunogenic cell death, a primer for adaptive immunity, functioning via multiple immune effector cells, including CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer T cells. By the end of 2017, additional mechanism work was underway to assess the potential breadth of this immunotherapy capability.
 
In June 2017, results of a Phase 2 study of PV-10 used in combination with regional radiation therapy (“radiotherapy”) were published by our research collaborators at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane, Australia (Foote et al., Journal of Surgical Oncology 2017; 115: 891). This investigator-initiated study concluded that the combination of PV-10 and radiotherapy resulted in lesion-specific, normal tissue-sparing ablation of disease. Safety data from this study were consistent with prior clinical trials and expanded access to PV-10 in melanoma.

In October 2017, we presented results of a quality of life study focused on patients with locally advanced cutaneous melanoma (the patient population eligible for enrollment in our Phase 3 melanoma study) at the International Society for Quality of Life Research (“ISOQOL”) annual conference.  A more detailed presentation of these data were published in December 2017 (Weitman et al., Melanoma Research 2017; Dec 19 Epub ahead of print). Using patient data elicited through semi-structured qualitative interviews, this work identified a core set of disease-related impacts experienced by patients, including worry/concern, altered clothing choices and limitations to physical functioning. 
 
Gastrointestinal Cancers
 
During 2017, we continued our exploratory Phase 1 study of cancers of the liver at four regional centers in the U.S. (St. Luke’s University Health Network in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Florida Hospital Tampa in Tampa, Florida, Sharp Memorial Hospital in San Diego, California, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee), and were preparing to add a fifth U.S. center (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas). This “basket study” enrolls patients with HCC and other tumor types that have metastasized to the liver. Patients are treated using percutaneous injection of PV-10 under image guidance into a single liver lesion; patients with multiple lesions may receive additional treatment cycles after initial safety follow-up. To date patients with HCC and liver metastases, including colorectal, lung, pancreatic, melanoma, ovarian, and breast, have been treated at the four regional centers. The fifth center, which is currently projected to enroll patients in the first half of 2018, will focus on uveal melanoma metastatic to the liver. We reported updated results from long-term follow-up of our initial patients at both the Annual Symposium on Clinical Interventional Oncology (CIO) in Hollywood, Florida and the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) in Shanghai, China in February 2017, showing long-term survival for some study participants with HCC and metastatic colorectal tumors. The preclinical mechanism of action work reported by Qin et al. was consistent with clinical observations reported for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer participating in our Phase 1 basket study.
 
In 2016 we initiated a Phase 1 study to assess PV-10 as an oncolytic immunotherapy for patients with symptomatic metastases of NETs to their liver. This study was open to enrollment at a single center in Australia in 2017 and uses a treatment protocol comparable to that employed in the Phase 1 liver cancer basket study. Because the NET study is focused on a single tumor type, it includes radiologic (medical imaging), blood biomarker, and quality of life assessments specific to NETs. To date no data have been reported from this study.


Pediatric Cancers
 
In December 2016 we announced a joint research agreement with POETIC to investigate the potential of PV-10 for pediatric cancers. This collaboration involves National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers that are part of the POETIC group such as Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Alberta Children’s Hospital, and other cancer centers. To date no data have been reported from this collaboration.
Dermatology (PH-10)
 
We are developing PH-10, an aqueous hydrogel formulation of rose bengal disodium, for topical administration to the skin for inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.
 
In January 2015, we commenced a mechanism of action study of PH-10 to characterize its immunologic signaling aspects, safety, and efficacy. The clinical portion of this study was completed in January 2016. Advanced immunologic profiling of clinical samples obtained from that work was completed in June 2017 and data were reported at Psoriasis Gene to Clinic in London, England in November 2017. These data demonstrated downregulation of more than 500 disease-related genes, including central “psoriasis-related” genes that were normalized to levels consistent with non-lesional skin, and established that PH-10 has a novel mechanism of action in inflammatory dermatoses.
 
Research and Development 
 
Our approach to drug development is centered around designing clinical studies for success based on science and medicine, rather than supporting the broadest possible label at the outset. Our overall clinical development program comprises two complementary and related paths based on the features of our investigational drugs and their rational applicability and relevancy to different patient populations. In cancer, for example, we believe PV-10 has important implications as a single agent for earlier stages of disease (i.e., Stage III or earlier), while combination of PV-10 with other classes of therapy or therapeutic agents is appropriate for more advanced stages (i.e., Stage IV).

Competition

In general, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are competitive, characterized by advances in products and technology. A number of companies have developed and continue to develop products that address the areas we have targeted. Some of these companies are pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that are international in scope and very large in size; while others are small companies that have been successful in one or more areas we are targeting. Existing or future pharmaceutical, device, or other competitors may develop products that accomplish similar functions to our technologies in ways that may be less expensive, receive faster regulatory approval, or receive greater market acceptance than our products. Many of our competitors have been in existence for longer than we have. They have greater capital resources, broader internal structure for research, development, manufacturing and marketing, and may be further along in their respective product cycles.
Federal Regulation of Therapeutic Products

All of the prescription drug candidates we currently contemplate developing will require approval by the FDA prior to sales within the U.S. and by comparable international governmental healthcare regulatory agencies prior to sale outside the U.S. The FDA and comparable international agencies impose substantial requirements on the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, manufacturing, quality control, safety and effectiveness claims, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, and promotion of our prescription drug candidates. While we attempt to minimize and avoid significant regulatory bars when formulating our products, some degree of regulation from these regulatory agencies is unavoidable.
 
The regulatory process required by the FDA, through which our prescription drug candidates must successfully pass before they may be marketed in the U.S., generally involves the following:



● | Pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Submission of an application that must become effective before clinical trials may begin; 
● | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication; and 
● | FDA approval to market a given product for a given indication after the appropriate application has been filed. 



For pharmaceutical products, pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product, its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. Where appropriate (for example, for human disease indications for which there exist inadequate animal models), we will attempt to obtain preliminary data concerning safety and efficacy of prescription drug candidates using carefully designed human pilot studies. We will require sponsored work to be conducted in compliance with pertinent local and international regulatory requirements, including those providing for Institutional Review Board approval, national governing agency approval, and patient informed consent, using protocols consistent with ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and other internationally recognized standards and delineated by the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards.

If the FDA is satisfied with the results and data from pre-clinical tests, it will authorize human clinical trials. Human clinical trials traditionally are conducted in three sequential phases which may overlap. Each of the three phases involves testing and study of specific aspects of the effects of the investigational product on human subjects, including testing for safety, dosage tolerance, side effects, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and clinical efficacy.
 
Phase 1 clinical trials include the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans, or via a new route of administration or new organ system if previously investigated in humans. These studies are closely monitored and may be conducted in patients but may also be conducted in healthy volunteer subjects. These studies are designed to determine the metabolic and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. While the FDA can cause us to end clinical trials at any phase due to safety concerns, Phase 1 clinical trials are primarily concerned with safety issues. We also attempt to obtain sufficient information about the drug candidate’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects during Phase 1 clinical trials to permit the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid, Phase 2 studies.
 
Phase 1 studies also evaluate drug metabolism, structure-activity relationships, and the mechanism of action in humans. These studies also determine which investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes. The total number of subjects included in Phase 1 studies varies with the drug but is generally in the range of 10 to 80.
 
Phase 2 clinical trials include the early controlled clinical studies conducted to obtain some preliminary data on the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition. This phase of testing also helps determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 studies are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving up to several hundred people.
 
Phase 3 studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained in Phase 2 and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug. Phase 3 studies also provide an adequate basis for extrapolating the results to the general population and transmitting that information in the physician labeling. Phase 3 studies usually include several hundred to several thousand people.


We have established a core clinical development team and have been working with external and FDA-experienced consultants to assist us in developing product-specific development and approval strategies, preparing the required submittals, guiding us through the regulatory process, and providing input into the design and site selection of human clinical studies.
 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we may not obtain FDA approval on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. The FDA or research institution conducting the trials may suspend clinical trials or may not permit trials to advance from one phase to another at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw a prescription drug approval if we do not comply with pertinent regulatory requirements and standards or if problems are identified after the product reaches the market. If the FDA grants approval of a prescription drug candidate, the approval may impose limitations, including limits on the indicated uses for which we may market a drug product. In addition, the FDA may require additional testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety and/or effectiveness of approved drug products that have been commercialized, and the agency has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Further, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug product may result in restrictions on the product, including withdrawal from the market.
 
Marketing our prescription drug candidates abroad will require similar regulatory approvals by equivalent national authorities and is subject to similar risks. To expedite development, we may pursue some or all of our initial clinical testing and approval activities outside the U.S., and in particular in those countries where our prescription drug candidates may have substantial medical and commercial relevance. In some such cases, any resulting drug products may be brought to the U.S. after substantial offshore experience is gained. Accordingly, we intend to pursue any such development in a manner consistent with U.S. and ICH standards so that the resultant development data is maximally applicable for potential global approval.
