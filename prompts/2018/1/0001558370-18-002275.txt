 Overview 
 Gemphire is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is committed to helping patients with cardiometabolic disorders, including dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We are focused on providing new treatment options for cardiometabolic diseases through our complementary, convenient, cost-effective product candidate, gemcabene, as add-on to the standard of care, especially statins, that will benefit patients, physicians, and payors. We are developing our product candidate gemcabene (CI-1027), a novel, once-daily, oral therapy, for pediatric and adult patients who present with NASH and for high risk cardiovascular patients who are unable to achieve normal levels of LDL-C (“bad” cholesterol) or triglycerides (“fats”) with currently approved therapies, primarily statin therapy.  Gemcabene’s potential to treat various subsets of cardiometabolic patients reflects its actions to reduce many known risk factors, particularly LDL-C, triglycerides and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), a marker of inflammation. By lowering the burden of these risk factors, we expect that gemcabene will provide benefits to a broad array of fatty liver and cardiometabolic patients. 
 Gemcabene’s mechanism of action is multifaceted. In the liver gemcabene acts in two major ways to reduce levels of circulating LDL-C and triglycerides: 1) inhibition of the two metabolic pathways that synthesize precursors (i.e., cholesterol and fatty acids) of VLDL-C, LDL-C and triglycerides and 2) stimulation of a liver mechanism known as the remnant receptor pathway that removes particles that contain cholesterol and triglycerides from the blood. Gemcabene’s stimulation of this remnant receptor pathway involves enhanced removal of an LDL-C precursor known as very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs). With regard to gemcabene’s anti-inflammatory properties, in human clinical trials and animal studies to date, gemcabene has been shown to significantly reduce plasma levels of CRP. Furthermore, in preclinical studies of dyslipidemia as well as NASH, gemcabene inhibited production of a number of known pro-inflammatory molecules (e.g., CRP, CCR2, CCR5, IL-6, TNF alpha, MCP-1 and MIP1-beta) as well as pro-fibrotic factors (e.g.,TIMP-1, MMP-2). Gemcabene has been tested as monotherapy or in combination with all U.S. approved doses of the highest intensity statins in nearly 1,100 subjects, including both healthy volunteers and patients, across 23 Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials and has demonstrated promising evidence of efficacy, safety and tolerability. Overall, gemcabene’s multifaceted mechanism of action provides the potential for safely addressing multiple major risk factors in a broad array of adult and pediatric cardiometabolic patients who have an elevated risk of cardiovascular or liver disease, even when taking conventional therapies. 
 Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is part of a group of conditions called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that affects one out of four people in the United States. In the United States NASH is estimated to affect between six to eight million people. NAFLD is a major public health concern given the recent increase in its prevalence and link to obesity and other metabolic comorbidities. The presentation of NASH resembles alcoholic liver disease but occurs in people who drink little or no alcohol. The major feature of NASH is excess fat content in the liver, along with inflammation and liver damage. It can lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver failure, liver-related death and liver transplantation. NASH is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, as many of the risk factors for NASH are similar to those that lead to cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in this patient population. Prevalence of NASH has increased due to the growing number of obese, dyslipidemic and diabetic patients. It is more common in women than in men and currently there are no FDA approved therapies for treating NASH.
 NAFLD has emerged as the leading cause of chronic liver disease in children and adolescents in the United States. A two-to three-fold rise in the rates of obesity and an increase in sedentary life-style in children over the last 20 years is likely responsible for the epidemic of NAFLD. It is estimated that 20% of children between the ages 12 to 19 are obese, and 36% of obese children have NAFLD. NALFD is estimated to affect seven million children overall in the United States. The estimated population prevalence for pediatric NASH is two million children. Pediatric NAFLD and NASH, while similar to the adult disease, can have distinct pathophysiological characteristics in terms of histology, disease progression, and ultimately adverse outcomes at early ages.  Steatosis and portal inflammation tend to be more severe in pediatric NAFLD. Children diagnosed with NAFLD often have elevated serum lipids and diabetes or prediabetes and have a 13.6 times greater risk of dying over the next 20 years, than children without NAFLD. It is estimated that 10 to 25% of children with NAFLD progress to NASH and then advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis by their third or fourth decade of life.

 Cardiovascular disease is a major health concern, causing more deaths globally than any other disease. Dyslipidemia leads to cardiovascular disease and is generally an important predictor of cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke. Dyslipidemia is generally characterized by an elevation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or bad cholesterol, triglycerides, or fat in the blood, or both. It represents one of the largest therapeutic areas with annual worldwide drug sales of approximately $22.0 billion in 2013. We estimate more than 40% of Americans have elevated LDL-C or triglycerides, or both. Statins, such as atorvastatin or rosuvastatin, are standard of care for LDL-C lowering, while fibrates, prescription fish oils and niacin are standard of care for triglyceride lowering. Although these drugs are highly prescribed and capable of reducing LDL-C and triglyceride levels, many patients are unable to effectively manage their dyslipidemia with currently approved therapies and are in need of additional treatment options. For example, approximately 40% of patients on statins are unable to meet their LDL-C lowering goal, and doubling a statin dose has been shown to incrementally lower LDL-C levels by a nominal percentage (approximately 6% based on historical evidence), while increasing safety and tolerability concerns. An even higher percentage of patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia do not achieve triglyceride levels low enough to reduce the risk of developing co-morbidities such as pancreatitis.
 We believe gemcabene possesses a differentiated product profile compared to other therapies in the market and in clinical development. Key attributes of our product candidate include the following:

· | Cost‑effective, once‑daily, oral therapy. Gemcabene is a small molecule formulated as a tablet and is cost effective to manufacture. As a once‑daily, oral therapy, gemcabene, if approved, would be more convenient than other non‑statin therapies, many of which require frequent injections or multiple daily doses. We expect to take a value‑based approach to pricing across all the target indications. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Promising safety and tolerability. Gemcabene was observed to be well tolerated in nearly 1,100 subjects across 23 Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials both as monotherapy and in combination with statins. No subjects died and no subjects experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) that was considered to be related to gemcabene. Adverse events (AEs) reported were generally mild to moderate in intensity. Gemcabene did not appear to increase the reporting of myalgia (muscle pain) or liver injury when given as monotherapy or when added to statin therapy in clinical trials. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | First-in-class mechanism. Gemcabene is a first-in-class, once-daily, oral therapy that may be suitable for patients who are unable to achieve normal levels of LDL-C or triglycerides with currently approved therapies, primarily statins. Gemcabene's mechanism of action (MOA) enhances the clearance of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) in the plasma and inhibition of the production of cholesterol and triglycerides in the liver. The combined effect of these mechanisms has been clinically observed to result in a reduction of plasma non-HDL-C, VLDL-C, LDL-C, apolipoprotein B and triglycerides. In addition, gemcabene has been shown to markedly lower high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in humans and improve insulin sensitization. Gemcabene’s effects on hsCRP may be due to its effect on reduction of IL-6 expression, as well as its direct effects on inhibiting transcription factors C/EBP-β and NF-kB interaction with the CRP gene. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pleiotropic MOA provides many beneficial attributes. At a high level, gemcabene acts on the liver to reduce production of cholesterol, triglycerides, and hsCRP. It also enhances the liver clearance of cholesterol- and triglyceride-rich particles (e.g., VLDL remnants) via the remnant receptor clearance systems. The molecular details of the clearance mechanisms are actively being elucidated in preclinical studies. Notably, with regard to enhancing the VLDL remnant clearance pathway, gemcabene reduces hepatic apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) mRNA expression and plasma apoC-III levels thereby making VLDL more susceptible to lipoprotein lipase mediated lipolysis (breakdown of the VLDL triglyceride to fatty acids for delivery to muscle for energy and adipose for storage) and efficient clearance of the resulting VLDL remnants by the liver VLDL remnant receptor prior to their conversion to LDL. Furthermore, gemcabene was found to enhance VLDL remnant receptor (i.e., also known as syndecan-1) activity by decreasing mRNA levels of an enzyme (sulfatase-2) that inactivates the receptor. Interestingly, diabetic and obese patients generally present with elevated VLDL-C and triglycerides, likely related to their elevated liver sulfatase-2 levels. Other molecular players in gemcabene’s MOA include a reduction in acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1) mRNA, a key metabolic step in fatty acid synthesis, and a decrease in CCR2/CCR5 receptor mRNA levels, which are involved in liver inflammation and the progression of NASH/NAFLD.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Significant lipid‑lowering of LDL‑C, high‑sensitivity C‑reactive protein (hsCRP) and triglycerides. In Phase 2 trials, patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with gemcabene as monotherapy were observed to have significantly lowered LDL‑C by approximately 30% from baseline and significantly lowered hsCRP by approximately 40% from baseline. In addition, patients with hypertriglyceridemia (≥200 mg/dL) were observed to have significantly lowered triglycerides by approximately 40%, and based on post‑hoc analysis, gemcabene was observed to lower triglycerides by up to 60% in patients with severe triglyceride levels (≥500 mg/dL). Our product candidate’s ability to meaningfully lower levels of multiple key lipids attributable to cardiovascular disease may expand its use across multiple indications within the dyslipidemia and NASH Market. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Additive effect of gemcabene. Across multiple Phase 2 trials in patients with uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia, including background stable statin therapy, gemcabene was observed to significantly lower LDL‑C by an additional 21%, range of 17% to 31%, from baseline. In subjects with mixed dyslipidemia, baseline, LDL≥100mg/dL and TG ≥200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL, gemcabene reduced LDL-C by 25%. This data indicates that gemcabene may better treat a large population of patients who are unable to reach their lipid goal with statins and other currently prescribed therapies, including those medications commonly used for diabetes and NASH patients. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No drug‑drug interactions when combined with high‑intensity statin doses. In two Phase 1 trials, gemcabene was tested in combination with high‑intensity statin doses, 80 mg simvastatin and 80 mg atorvastatin. No clinically relevant drug‑drug interactions were observed. In addition, gemcabene has been formulated as a fixed‑dose combination tablet with various atorvastatin doses, which may offer additional convenience and compliance to patients. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We are pursuing gemcabene as treatment in the following indications (representing up to 20 million addressable at-risk patients in the US): (1) for patients with dyslipidemias including familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), severe hypertriglyceridemia, and, potentially ASCVD, likely as add-on therapy to statins, and (2) for patients, including both adults and children, diagnosed with NASH/NAFLD as monotherapy or in combination with other approved treatments. 

· | familial hypercholesterolemia is comprised of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) patients and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) patients, who collectively represent an estimated 0.5 to 1.5 million people in the US and an additional 15 to 30 million worldwide. HoFH is a rare genetic disease that results in elevated LDL‑C usually due to mutations on both copies of the LDL‑receptor gene leading to reduced (defective) or absence (deficient) LDL receptor function. Other genetic mutations, such as a those on the apoB gene, can lead to HoFH. HoFH is considered an orphan disease, as there are approximately 300 to 2,000 HoFH patients in the US and 6,000 to 45,000 patients worldwide. In comparison, HeFH is a more prevalent genetic condition which results in elevated LDL‑C usually due to a mutation causing either defective or deficient function on one of the two copies of the LDL‑receptor gene;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG), in which patients with elevated triglycerides (TGs > 500 mg/dL) are at an increased risk of developing co-morbidities such as pancreatitis. There are 3.0 to 3.5 million patients in the US and another estimated 60 to 75 million worldwide;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), are severe diseases of the liver caused by inflammation and a buildup of fat in the organ, which can lead to liver cirrhosis, fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver failure, liver related death and liver transplantation. There are an estimated 80 million patients with NAFLD and 8 million patients with NASH, including approximately 2 million pediatric NASH patients, in the US. The global prevalence of NAFLD is estimated at 24% and NASH is estimated to be 3 to 5%; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), patients with hypercholesterolemia, or patients with elevated LDL-C who have had or are at risk for a cardiovascular event, such as heart attack, stroke, and/or revascularization. This are an estimated 10 million ASCVD patients in the US of which approximately half have mixed dyslipidemia. Worldwide estimates of ASCVD patients range from 100 to 120 million. That said, the addressable market for gemcabene in ASCVD remains to be fully elucidated given that market dynamics continue to evolve for this condition;

 We initially began pursuing HoFH given that gemcabene has received orphan drug designation for this indication. We believe we can design an efficient development plan to provide a new treatment alternative for these patients. Furthermore, we believe that gemcabene’s potential ability to treat FH patients, who represent a high-risk segment of the dyslipidemia market, can further enhance brand awareness among key thought leaders and physicians. Studies to date suggest gemcabene has the potential to treat a wide range of cardiometabolic conditions generally characterized by elevation of LDL-C, triglycerides, and/or inflammatory markers. Additional benefits of gemcabene include: (1) promising clinical data and mechanistic effects that have been associated with disease progression in these indications; (2) cost‑effective manufacturing process; (3) convenient oral dosing; (4) viability as safe adjunctive combination therapy; and (5) large commercial potential. In Q2 of 2018, we expect to report top-line data from the INDIGO-1 trial in dyslipidemia. We initiated two Phase 2a trials in NASH/NAFLD in late 2017 and early 2018 and expect to report top-line data from these trials in late 2018 and early 2019, respectively.
 Gemcabene Pipeline Indications

 We are in the process of scheduling an End of Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The exact timing of the EOP2 meeting will depend in part on the FDA’s timeline to review our 2-year rodent carcinogenicity study, for which the in-life work was completed in October 2017. The EOP2 meeting is intended to reach an agreement with the FDA on the design of Phase 3 registration trials in hypercholesterolemia and long‑term safety exposure for our target indications. We also intend to seek FDA advice in future meetings for additional indications including SHTG and NASH as we complete ongoing trials in those indications. We intend to pursue similar discussions with Canadian and European health authorities. Other markets will be considered as appropriate.
 We believe it is unlikely the FDA will require us to initiate a cardiovascular outcomes trial for our target dyslipidemia indications. The FDA has not required the initiation or completion of cardiovascular outcomes trials for recent approvals of certain dyslipidemia therapies, including non‑statin therapies targeting LDL‑C for the treatment of HoFH, HeFH and ASCVD and triglyceride lowering for treatment of SHTG. Cardiovascular outcomes trials require evaluation of cardiovascular clinical conditions in large patient populations over a long period of time and are both costly and time‑consuming. However, for commercial and competitive reasons, such as the potential to broaden the label claims, we intend to review with the FDA a design for a cardiovascular outcomes trial enriched for high risk patients whose risk factors could be modified by gemcabene. Such a trial, if pursued, could be initiated prior to an NDA submission and completed post‑approval.
 Our company was co‑founded by Dr. Charles Bisgaier, who was responsible for licensing exclusive worldwide rights to gemcabene from Pfizer in April 2011. Prior to co‑founding the original Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. (Esperion) in 1998, which was acquired by Pfizer in 2004, Dr. Bisgaier worked at Parke‑Davis, a division of Warner-Lambert Company from 1990 to 1998, and was instrumental in the discovery and development of gemcabene, as well as the development of

Lipitor and Lopid. Many of our employees and consultants have been involved in the historical development of gemcabene and other innovative dyslipidemia product candidates in development, including ETC‑216, a synthetic high‑density lipoprotein mimetic based on ApoAI‑Milano (developed by the original Esperion, Pfizer, and currently The Medicines Company), ACP‑501 (developed by AlphaCore Pharma, later acquired by AstraZeneca) and Bempedoic Acid (AKA ESP 55016 and ETC‑1002, developed by the original Esperion, Pfizer and the current Esperion. We have organized a medical and scientific advisory board including Drs. John Kastelein, Evan Stein, Robert Hegele, Dirk Blom, Harold Bays, Rohit Loomba, and Kevin Williams. Many of our advisors have been involved in numerous dyslipidemia, cardiovascular and NASH clinical trials (e.g., statins from their earliest trials, fibrates, ezetimibe, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, extended release niacin, antisense oligonucleotides (mipomersen), monoclonal antibodies including PCSK9 inhibitors and multiple development stage NASH drugs) and published numerous research papers. The management team, led by our Interim CEO Dr. Steven Gullans, collectively has significant experience in operating and financing biopharmaceutical companies and discovering, developing and commercializing treatments in the cardiovascular and orphan markets.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become a leading cardiometabolic biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes best‑in‑class therapies for lipid disorders including dyslipidemia and NASH.
 The core elements of our strategy to achieve our goal are the following:

· | Advance the late‑stage clinical development of gemcabene across multiple target indications, beginning with FH and SHTG and then expanding into NASH. We are focused on multiple cardiometabolic indications for gemcabene including FH, SHTG, NASH/NAFLD, and, in the future, ASCVD. Within these indications there are a number of orphan indications such as HoFH or FPL that we may pursue. In addition, we recently initiated a pediatric NAFLD/NASH trial which, if successful, could open opportunities within the pediatric population. In the second quarter of 2018, we expect to report top-line data from our late stage clinical trial for gemcabene in SHTG patients (INDIGO-1). The data from our 23 completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials and multiple preclinical studies have provided us with a comprehensive set of information and key insights into gemcabene’s mechanism of action, lipid‑lowering and anti-inflammatory effects, and safety profile. With regard to the regulatory path forward for gemcabene’s target dyslipidemia conditions, our interactions to date with the FDA, along with relatively recent approvals of other cardiovascular therapies, such as biologic PCSK9 inhibitors for HoFH, HeFH and ASCVD as well as prescription fish oils for SHTG, provide information regarding precedent regulatory pathways to approval. Furthermore, given gemcabene’s attributes as compared to other products on the market, we believe that there is a likelihood of commercial success following approval across multiple indications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Recently launched Phase 2 NASH/NAFLD trials target adult, pediatric, and orphan indications. We recently announced the initiation of two open-label NAFLD/NASH trials, one in familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL) and one in pediatric NAFLD/NASH. We expect top-line data from the FPL trial in the fourth quarter of 2018 and from the pediatric trial in the first quarter of 2019. Our rationale for pursuing gemcabene in NASH and/or NAFLD relates to its mechanism of action to decrease the production of the apoC‑III protein and possibly inhibit ACC, which has been observed to result in the lowering of triglycerides in the plasma and inhibiting de novo lipogenesis, and thereby possibly reduce liver fat content. We completed pre-clinical testing for gemcabene in an established NASH preclinical model (STAM™) designed by SMC Laboratories of Japan which showed a reduction in liver NAS score and fibrosis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our approach to clinical trials for NAFLD and NASH has been guided by discussions with key opinion leaders (KOLs) and others in the field who recommended we conduct highly focused Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept (PoC) studies to characterize in some detail the efficacy and biological actions of gemcabene, without having to deal with a multitude of confounding variables that can affect NASH trials. In keeping with this strategy, adult FPL and pediatric NAFLD/NASH represent indications where patients can be recruited relatively quickly, are considered relatively compliant, do not drink alcohol, and generally have fewer co-morbidities. These PoC studies will evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy related to several parameters in adult and pediatric fatty liver populations. We will collect standard measures of liver status and fat content (MRI-PDFF), as well as information about changes in other liver biomarkers and liver function. We believe these results will enable us to design optimal future pivot trials, in conjunction with 

 
  9

 
FDA guidance, that will open opportunities for gemcabene to treat adult, pediatric, and orphan NASH populations. With regard to regulatory and commercial paths forward, although there are currently no approved NASH therapies to serve as references, we believe that there is and will continue to be sufficient guidance available from the FDA, providers, payors and others to enable us to design and implement an approvable Phase 3 program and successfully launch a commercial product in NASH. 

· | Pursue oral combination opportunities for gemcabene. Oral combination therapy is the current paradigm for the treatment of dyslipidemia (and expected for treatment of NASH/NAFLD), as patients typically require multiple drugs to address their dyslipidemia as well as other co‑morbidities such as diabesity. Based on existing data demonstrating additive effects on LDL‑C and triglyceride lowering as well as no drug‑drug interactions with statins, we believe that gemcabene has the potential to be developed as a fixed‑dose combination with low to high dose statins, which, if approved, may enhance adoption in the market and patient compliance. As part of our development strategy, we plan to formulate and manufacture gemcabene in fixed‑dose combination with statins and other lipid‑lowering agents. However, given our recently launched NASH program, the combination therapy program has become a lower priority. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to build out our patent portfolio for gemcabene. We believe our patents and patent applications provide us with a significant competitive advantage. As of February 26, 2018, we had 46 issued patents and 45 pending patent applications for gemcabene in the United States and internationally directed to formulations, compositions, methods of use and methods of manufacturing. We intend to aggressively prosecute and defend our patent portfolio and pursue new patents in order to ensure the long term commercial success of gemcabene. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maximize the global commercial value of gemcabene. We have retained all commercial and manufacturing rights to gemcabene. We intend to evaluate our strategic alternatives to collaborate with global biopharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of gemcabene. We believe we could independently commercialize gemcabene for the treatment of patients with HoFH in the United States with a targeted sales force and would seek commercial partners outside of the United States. We may co-promote the SHTG indication with a partner with our internal sales force and distributor(s). For larger indications, such as ASCVD and NASH we expect to assess partnership opportunities for Phase 3 development and the worldwide commercialization of gemcabene. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leverage the expertise and experience of our management team to evaluate future in‑licensing and acquisition opportunities. Across our leadership team, we have discovered and/or developed Lipitor, Lopid, Bempedoic Acid, ETC‑216, ACP‑501, CER‑209, CER‑001 and PNT‑2258, and commercialized many lipid-regulating and orphan drugs including Crestor, Myalept and Lynparza. Our team is well‑qualified to identify and in‑license or acquire clinical‑stage cardio‑metabolic assets, and we intend to evaluate these opportunities to diversify our pipeline and generate long‑term growth.

  Overview of Dyslipidemia Market
 According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the world, responsible for 17.5 million, or approximately one in three, deaths in 2012. Cardiovascular disease is influenced by both environment and genetics. Environmental factors include diet, smoking, excess weight and sedentary lifestyle. Genetic defects can cause certain types of cardiovascular disease, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition in which mutations on a gene are responsible for the elevated LDL‑C levels in patients. Cardiovascular burden in the US is expanding at an alarming rate. The prevalence of CVD was in 41.5% in 2015, due to the rising effects of obesity and the earlier onset of type 2 diabetes. It is estimated that 45% of the US population will have at least one cardiovascular condition by 2035. 
 Dyslipidemia is characterized by an elevation of LDL‑C, triglycerides or both. Dyslipidemia leads to cardiovascular disease and is generally an important predictor of cardiovascular events, including heart attack and stroke,. It is estimated that 71 million American adults, or approximately 33%, have high LDL‑C levels, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We estimate from 2013 data that over 33 million patients are prescribed statins, of which a little more than half, or 19 million, are secondary prevention patients.1 Of these 19 million secondary prevention patients, approximately 10 million are ASCVD patients who are not at their LDL-C goal. Furthermore, it is estimated that over 30% of American adults have elevated triglycerides above 150 mg/dL, and high levels of triglycerides are even

evident in patients with normal cholesterol levels. If untreated, elevated triglycerides levels may lead to more serious illnesses, such as atherosclerosis (plaque build‑up in the arteries) and severely elevated triglyceride levels may lead to pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). The dyslipidemia market has achieved approximately $22 billion in worldwide drug sales in 2013 and remains one of the largest therapeutic markets.

Recent Developments in the Dyslipidemia Market
 In 2015 there were key advisory panel meetings and regulatory approvals for non‑statin LDL‑C lowering drugs. Specifically, Biologics License Applications (BLAs) for two PCSK9 inhibitors were considered by the FDA and have subsequently been approved in the United States and Europe. We believe these approvals signal the FDA’s continued view that LDL‑C lowering is an acceptable surrogate endpoint for traditional drug approval in certain lipid indications and that cardiovascular outcomes trials would not be required for such approvals. The FDA however noted that one should accept very little risk from a novel LDL‑C‑lowering drug when approving for a broad population only based on its effects on LDL‑C. The approved PCSK9 products are described below. Their FDA‑approved labels indicate that their effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not yet been determined.
· | On August 27, 2015, Repatha®, developed by Amgen Inc. (Amgen), was approved in the United States for use along with diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy in adults with HoFH, HeFH and ASCVD, who need additional lowering of LDL‑C.

· | On July 21, 2015 and September 28, 2015, the European Commission approved Repatha and Praluent respectively, each with a broader label compared to that in the United States. The approved indications in Europe included the treatment of adults with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia as: (1) combination therapy with maximally tolerated dose of statin or statin and other lipid‑lowering drugs; or (2) monotherapy or combination therapy with other lipid‑lowering drugs in patients who are statin‑intolerant, or for whom statin is contraindicated. Repatha is also approved for the treatment of HoFH in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over in combination with other lipid‑lowering drugs.

 Regulatory Precedents for Approval in Dyslipidemia Indications 
 Historical data suggest a linear relationship between LDL‑C and cardiovascular disease, showing that lower LDL‑C levels reduces the risk of mortality and other cardiovascular events (for example, for about every 2mg/dL reduction in LDL-C, an additional 1.2 % reduction in cardiovascular risk reduction is realized). The chart below by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ (CTT) Collaboration provides the foundation for this ‘LDL‑C hypothesis’.

 For nearly three decades (1987 to 2015), the FDA has accepted LDL‑C lowering as a surrogate endpoint for reducing cardiovascular risk for traditional approval on over 15 lipid‑lowering drugs without requirements to initiate or complete a cardiovascular outcomes trial. Traditional approval may be based on surrogate endpoints such as LDL‑C and blood pressure that are known to predict clinical benefit, in contrast to accelerated approval based on surrogate endpoints that are only reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and require confirmatory evidence of actual benefit after approval. With traditional approval based on LDL‑C reduction, the FDA does not have a regulatory mechanism to require any further efficacy trials and does not require sponsors to conduct a post‑approval cardiovascular outcomes trial. Sponsors who have chosen to conduct cardiovascular outcomes trials before or after traditional approval, which is encouraged by the FDA, have voluntarily done so to seek additional claims.
 In approving drugs, the FDA considers the magnitude of effect in relation to the safety profile. Not only has the use of LDL‑C as a surrogate marker to predict the risk of cardiovascular events been accepted by the FDA but the importance of LDL‑C lowering has also been recognized by clinical organizations such as American College of Cardiology, 

 
  13

 
American Heart Association (AHA), National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP‑III), American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, and National Lipid Association.
 These approvals have occurred over the last decade, as have studies showing that certain LDL‑C lowering statin and non‑statin drugs did not in fact provide cardiovascular benefits (e.g., Niacin in AIM‑HIGH trial) and/or show unexpected safety concerns (e.g., ezetimibe in ENHANCE with cancer). In addition, a class of drugs known as cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors (CETPi) with a different mechanism (which increases high‑density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‑C) while sometimes lowering LDL‑C), has 3 drugs that failed to demonstrate efficacy in Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome trials. The first CETPi drug, Pfizer’s torcetrapib, lowered LDL‑C but showed increased cardiovascular event rates in patients due to off‑target effects in ILLUMINATE, which we believe established a higher FDA standard for cardiovascular outcomes trials for the CETPi class.
 In patient populations such as HoFH and SHTG, we believe the FDA recognizes that an outcomes trial would be difficult and as a result has established precedent drug approvals over time based on surrogate endpoints (LDL‑C for cardiovascular risk and triglycerides for pancreatitis risk, respectively). Recent examples include Juxtapid (2012), Kynamro (2013) and Repatha (2015) for HoFH and Vascepa (2012) for SHTG.
 In the broader populations, such as HeFH and ASCVD, the FDA recently approved PCSK9 inhibitors based on LDL‑C as the surrogate endpoint and did not require the completion of cardiovascular outcomes trial in these high‑risk dyslipidemia patients. The FDA approved Praluent and Repatha based on LDL‑C reduction as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy (and diet), but did not approve these drugs for monotherapy or primary prevention patients, noting that such approval may be premature in the absence of cardiovascular outcomes data.
 Collectively, recent approvals of new cardiovascular drugs, results from clinical trials of non‑statin product candidates, and our recent regulatory guidance that we received from the FDA regarding our development plans have provided us with some assurance that LDL‑C lowering product candidates in development, such as gemcabene, will not be required to conduct cardiovascular outcomes trials in the United States and Europe prior to approval for our target indications planned in combination with statins assuming a favorable benefit/risk profile.
 hsCRP Biomarker of Interest
 Inflammation plays a significant role in the propagation of atherosclerosis and susceptibility to cardiovascular events. Of the wide array of inflammatory biomarkers that have been studied, hsCRP (or CRP) has received the most attention for its use in risk reclassification of cardiovascular disease. Recently, at the 2015 European Society for Cardiology meeting, Merck presented a post‑hoc analysis of the IMPROVE‑IT trial which confirmed the importance of lowering both LDL‑C and hsCRP levels to below 70 mg/dL and 2 mg/L, respectively, with a 27% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular events occurring in patients that were able to attain these target levels compared to those patients who achieved neither of these target levels. In 2017, in its CANTOS trial, Novartis’ canakinumab demonstrated an outcomes benefit for mortality and other modifiable risk factors for CV disease by lowering hsCRP (median hsCRP reduction of 37% led to a 15% reduction in cardiovascular related MACE) without affecting LDL-C. These findings support the potential for novel non‑statin therapies that can demonstrate clinical efficacy in both LDL‑C and hsCRP reduction. Gemcabene’s ability to substantially lower hsCRP in conjunction with LDL‑C may offer further benefit to the cardiovascular health of patients.
 Overview of NASH Market
 NASH is an advanced form of NAFLD in which a buildup of excess triglycerides in the liver (steatosis), usually in the context of metabolic dysregulation, results in liver damage (hepatocyte ballooning) and increased inflammation. This condition can lead to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in some patients. NASH is now one of the most common causes for liver transplantation. There are currently no approved medications for treating NASH in any market across the globe. Disease management chiefly involves lifestyle modification, some off-label medication use, and monitoring for disease progression. Off-label medications typically include antioxidant, antidiabetic, and lipid modifying agents. Despite the potentially serious liver complications, the natural progression of NASH is relatively slow, and CV disease is the leading cause of death among NASH patients, partly as a result of the disease and partly due to the common comorbidities in patients with NASH, including type 2 diabetes and obesity. NASH is now the second most common cause for liver transplantation in the U.S. and it is anticipated to become the leading cause by 2020.

 Regulatory Trends for Approval in NASH
     As the NASH competitive landscape matures, the clinical and regulatory pathways are evolving. In February of 2017, the FDA approved a significant amendment to Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s obeticholic acid (OCA) protocol signaling potential standards for future NASH trials: (1) only one primary endpoint is required for success – either improvement in fibrosis or NASH resolution – but not both; and (2) the FDA agreed upon an objective definition of NASH resolution.
     Our Target Indications
 We believe that oral, once‑daily gemcabene as an add‑on to statin and other existing therapies is differentiated by the ability to lower multiple risk factors (LDL‑C, hsCRP and triglycerides) and, if approved, presents a significant opportunity across multiple indications in dyslipidemia and NASH. These indications span from HoFH to more prevalent conditions, such as HeFH, SHTG, NASH, and, in the future, ASCVD in which therapies are required to reduce elevated levels of LDL‑C, triglycerides, inflammation or any combination thereof. Our target indications are summarized below with a total of approximately 14 million addressable dyslipidemia patients in the United States who could be treated with gemcabene, and another six million patients with NASH in the U.S. Patient Related Large Markets for Dyslipidemia and NASH

     Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH)
 There are two types of FH patients, Homozygous FH (HoFH) and Heterozygous (HeFH), generally related to either two or one genetic defects in the LDL-C receptor pathway, respectively. HoFH is a rare genetic disease that is usually caused by mutation in both alleles of the LDL receptor gene responsible for removing LDL from the blood. As a result of having defective or deficient LDL receptor function, HoFH patients exhibit severely high LDL-C levels, are at very high risk of experiencing premature cardiovascular events, such as a heart attack or stroke, and develop premature and progressive atherosclerosis. LDL‑C levels in HoFH patients are often in the range of 500 mg/dL to 1,000 mg/dL, compared to a normal target range of 70 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL. Unless treated, most patients with HoFH do not survive adulthood beyond 30 years of age. There are approximately 300 to 2,000 HoFH patients in the United States and 6,000 to 45,000 patients in the rest of the world based on an estimated prevalence rate of one in 160,000 to one in one million.

 Current available treatments for HoFH generally include a combination of dietary intervention, statins, ezetimibe and other approved LDL‑C lowering therapies, including lipoprotein apheresis. However, even when combination therapies are utilized, many patients still have high LDL‑C levels and are still at high risk of cardiovascular disease. The FDA has approved two non‑statin therapies for HoFH, Juxtapid, marketed by Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Aegerion), and Kynamro, marketed by Sanofi. Although these drugs have demonstrated efficacy, they have significant safety and tolerability concerns, including boxed warnings for liver toxicity on the product labels. Recently, the FDA has also approved Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, for HoFH patients, but this therapy has limitations due to its mechanism of action reliant on functional LDL‑receptors. In clinical trials, Repatha has shown substantially less LDL‑C lowering from baseline in patients with HoFH compared to LDL-C lowering in patients with other hypercholesterolemia indications.
 On February 6, 2014, gemcabene received orphan drug designation by the FDA for treatment of HoFH. We believe that pursuing the HoFH indication may enable gemcabene to reach the market sooner than for other indications due to: (1) approval pathway based on a single, small Phase 3 trial; (2) no requirement for cardiovascular outcomes trials; and (3) potential for priority review by the FDA in light of the unmet medical need in this orphan population. Furthermore, we believe that gemcabene’s potential to treat patients in the most severe segment of the dyslipidemia market on top of statins and other lipid‑lowering therapies (including ezetimibe and Repatha) will enhance brand awareness among key thought leaders and physicians.
 The HeFH patient population is generally comprised of individuals who have one defective gene that leads to elevated LDL-C levels at or above 190 mg/dL. These patients are prone to premature cardiovascular events. The incidence of patients with HeFH is estimated to be approximately one in 200 and one in 500, and, accordingly, we estimate there are approximately 0.5 to 1.5 million patients with HeFH in the United States and 15 to 30 million in the rest of the world.
     Current approved treatments for HeFH include statins, ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants and the recently approved injectable PCSK9 inhibitors. Despite the availability of various treatments, many patients are still unable to achieve recommended LDL-C levels. In addition, patients, physicians and payors may prefer more convenient, cost-effective, oral drugs.
 We believe obtaining approval for the HeFH indication will enable gemcabene to reach a large market of patients with the inability to attain their LDL‑C goal using current therapies (including high‑intensity statins, ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors). An approval in HeFH would allow gemcabene to be introduced into another indication for very high LDL‑C levels and enable physicians globally to have another oral, once‑daily, cost‑effective, well‑tolerated with high intensity statins option in treating this complex patient population, while also lowering LDL‑C, hsCRP, and triglycerides.
 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG)
 Elevated triglycerides are often caused by an inherited disorder or exacerbated by uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypothyroidism and sedentary habits. A recent scientific statement on “Triglycerides and Cardiovascular Disease” issued by the American Heart Association based on a review of the pivotal role of triglycerides in lipid metabolism, reaffirmed that triglycerides are not directly atherogenic, but represent an important biomarker of cardiovascular disease. Patients with severe triglycerides greater than 500 mg/dL, or SHTG, have increased risk of developing pancreatitis, a painful and potentially life‑threatening inflammation of the pancreas. Based on a 1.1% prevalence rate in the United States, as published by the American Heart Association, we estimate there are approximately 3.5 million patients with SHTG in the United States and 75 million patients in the rest of the world.
 Current available treatments for SHTG consist of dietary modifications to lower the intake of fatty foods and the use of fibrates, prescription fish oils and niacin. These treatments are often inadequate in lowering triglyceride levels below 500 mg/dL, the level at which patients are at an increased risk for developing pancreatitis. Due to the severely elevated triglyceride levels in this patient population, reducing triglyceride levels below 500 mg/dL may require reductions in triglyceride levels of 40% or more. Current therapies, even in combination, are often insufficient in achieving such a result. In addition, many of the existing treatments do not combine well with statins for treating SHTG.
 We believe that pursuing SHTG may enable gemcabene to reach a large population of patients with triglyceride levels above 500 mg/dL and offer a convenient, oral, once‑daily dosing with no food effects that may have the potential to result in better efficacy than standard of care, while being well‑tolerated with statins.

 Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)
 NAFLD (“fatty liver” where patients have fat in their liver, but no inflammation or liver damage) affects 10-30% of Americans. NASH is a severe form of fatty liver disease with the presence of hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation and fibrosis in the organ. In the United States, NASH affects up to approximately 2-5% of the population roughly at 6 million adult NASH patients and 2 million pediatric NASH patients. The underlying cause of NASH is unclear, but it most often occurs in persons who are middle-aged and overweight or obese. Many patients with NASH have elevated serum lipids, diabetes or pre-diabetes. Progression of NAFLD/NASH can lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver failure and liver-related death. Liver transplantation is currently the only treatment for advanced cirrhosis with liver failure. 
     Our first two trials for this indication are focused evaluating the potential effects of gemcabene on NAFLD/NASH in (i) a specialty-adult population in patients with Familial Partial Lipodystrophy (FPL) and (ii) the pediatric NAFLD/NASH population. 
     FPL is a rare genetic disorder and orphan disease characterized by an abnormal distribution of fatty (adipose) tissue. As the body is unable to store fat correctly, a buildup can occur around all vital organs and in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia). FPL can also cause an abnormal buildup of fats in the liver (hepatic steatosis), which can result in an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) and abnormal liver function. FPL can lead to loss of metabolic control and a variety of metabolic abnormalities, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia and NASH.
     NAFLD/NASH in children is a major public health concern given the recent increase in its prevalence and link to obesity and other metabolic comorbidities. NAFLD has emerged as the leading cause of chronic liver disease in children and adolescents in the United States. A two- to three-fold rise in the rates of obesity in children over the last 20 years is likely responsible for the epidemic of NAFLD. It is estimated that 20% of children between the ages 12 to 19 are obese, and 36% of obese children have NAFLD. NALFD is estimated to affect 7 million children overall in the U.S.; the estimated population prevalence for pediatric NASH is 2 million children.
     Pediatric NAFLD and NASH, while similar to the adult diseases, have distinct pathophysiological characteristics in terms of histology, disease progression, and ultimately adverse outcomes at early ages. Steatosis and portal inflammation tend to be more severe in pediatric NAFLD. Children diagnosed with NAFLD often have elevated serum lipids and diabetes or prediabetes and have a 13.6 times greater risk of dying over the next 20 years, than children without NAFLD. Progression of NAFLD and NASH can lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver failure and liver-related death. It is estimated that 10- 25% of children with NAFLD progress to NASH and then advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis by their third or fourth decade of life. Liver transplantation is currently the only treatment for advanced cirrhosis with liver failure.
     At this time, there are no approved treatments by the FDA for NAFLD/NASH for either adults or children. Based on the current understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms associated with NASH, several compounds are in clinical development, although none have been approved to date. The Clinical Trials website lists many trials for NASH. These compounds target the regulation of dyslipidemia (e.g. acetyl CoA carboxylase inhibitors, bile acid/fatty acid conjugates), inflammation (e.g. combined CCR2/CCRCR5 inhibitor) and/or fibrosis (e.g. 6-ethylchenodeoxycholic acid). 
 Gemcabene may be effective in treating patients for NASH given its mechanism of action around inflammation and triglycerides, especially for obese and diabetic patients. If approved, we expect gemcabene to be used as an oral combination with statins and other drugs approved for NASH with complementary mechanisms. 
 Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD)
 ASCVD represents patients who have experienced or are at risk of a cardiovascular event and are unable to meet their LDL-C lowering goal of less than 70 mg/dL with maximally tolerated statin therapy. This population also includes many patients who, in addition to not being able to meet their LDL-C lowering goal, often have elevated triglyceride levels and may benefit in reduction of both their elevated LDL-C and TG from gemcabene. We estimate that approximately 10 million patients in the United States and 200 million patients in the rest of the world have a need for additional therapies to effectively and safely bring them closer to their LDL-C and triglyceride lowering goals.

 
  17

 

 Currently approved treatments for both primary hypercholesterolemia and ASCVD include statins, ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, fibrates and PCSK9 inhibitors. While these drugs have demonstrated efficacy in lipid-lowering in this population, they do not sufficiently address the patients with mixed dyslipidemia who need to lower both LDL-C and triglycerides.
 We believe that there is a meaningful number of underserved ASCVD patients who are: (1) unable to reach LDL‑C and triglyceride goals on maximally tolerated statin therapy; (2) require LDL‑C reduction beyond the 6% reduction observed when statin dose is doubled; or (3) unable to tolerate higher doses of statins. However, if our recently launched Phase 2 clinical trial programs in NASH prove successful, we will likely delay the launch of a Phase 3 ASCVD trial in favor of conducting pivotal NASH trials. Nonetheless, if gemcabene is ultimately approved for ASCVD, it may potentially offer patients, especially cardiometabolic patients, a preferred well‑tolerated combination therapy with a statin and/or ezetimibe that is convenient, oral, once‑daily, cost effective, and impacts multiple factors, LDL-C, hsCRP and triglycerides, that all add to the residual cardiovascular risk in these patients.
 Our Product Candidate — Gemcabene
 Our product candidate, gemcabene, is a novel, once‑daily, oral therapy designed to target known lipid metabolic pathways to lower levels of LDL‑C, hsCRP and triglycerides. Gemcabene shares many of the attributes of statin therapy, including broad therapeutic applications, convenient route of administration and cost‑effective manufacturing process, but does not appear to increase the reporting of myalgia when added to statin therapy. Gemcabene has also shown additive LDL-C lowering in combination with stable low, moderate or high‑intensity statin therapy. We also plan to develop a fixed‑dose combination of gemcabene with atorvastatin to enhance market adoption and maximize the likelihood of commercial success.
 We are developing multiple indications for gemcabene, ranging from HoFH, an orphan indication, to more prevalent conditions, such as SHTG, NASH, HeFH, and in the future, ASCVD. During 2017, we read out two late stage dyslipidemia clinical trials for gemcabene: an 8-patient trial for HoFH (COBALT-1) and a 105 patient trial for hypercholesterolemia on high‑intensity statin therapy including HeFH and ASCVD patients (ROYAL-1). In the second quarter of 2018, we expect to read out top-line data from a late stage 90 patient trial for SHTG (INDIGO-1). In addition, we initiated two Phase 2a trials in NASH/NAFLD in early 2018 and expect to report top-line data from these trials in late 2018 and early 2019, respectively.
 We licensed global rights to gemcabene from Pfizer in April 2011. We will continue to leverage the extensive preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and formulation work previously conducted to further advance the development of gemcabene.
 Mechanism of Action
 Gemcabene has a mechanism of action that involves: (1) enhancing the clearance of VLDL; and (2) blocking the overall production of hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis. Based on prior clinical trials, the combined effect for these mechanisms has been observed to result in a reduction of plasma VLDL‑C, LDL‑C, triglycerides and hsCRP, as well as elevation of HDL‑C. Gemcabene mainly distributes to the liver where it has its effect as the active molecule.
 (1)ApoC‑III protein is known to be causal in cardiovascular disease. Gemcabene enhances VLDL clearance by decreasing apoC-III messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, thereby reducing apoC‑III protein production and plasma levels. ApoC‑III is a small protein (~9 kDa) that inhibits hepatic uptake of triglyceride‑rich particles such as VLDL. VLDL lipoproteins are catabolized to VLDL remnants in plasma. The VLDL remnants are either cleared from the plasma via remnant receptors or are further catabolized to LDL. The reduction in apoC-III exposes apolipoprotein E (apoE), a 35 kDa protein that is also present on the VLDL lipoproteins and VLDL remnants. ApoE is essential for the normal catabolism of triglyceride‑rich particles. This favors the enhanced clearance of the VLDL remnants via ApoE remnant receptors and reduces the formation of LDL particles, while also breaking down triglycerides by lipoprotein lipase to deliver more fatty acids to muscle and adipose tissue. We have observed in preclinical studies that gemcabene significantly clears VLDL in the plasma with corresponding reductions in the liver apoC‑III mRNA levels and apoC‑III plasma protein levels in rats. In a hypertriglyceridemic human clinical trial, gemcabene was shown to significantly decrease both apoC‑III and triglycerides.

      (2)Gemcabene reduces de novo lipogenesis through both hepatic cholesterol and TG synthesis, which lowers TG-rich lipoproteins (e.g., VLDLs) and their metabolic product (LDL) in the plasma. Gemcabene has been shown to inhibit radiolabeled acetate incorporation into TG and cholesterol in primary rat hepatocytes in culture and in the liver of mice, supporting gemcabene’s mechanism of action by inhibition of the synthesis of both fatty acids and cholesterol. Gemcabene may act as an inhibitor of ACC targeting the rate‑limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis, subsequently leading to a decreased hepatic triglyceride production.

 The diagram below depicts the novel mechanisms of gemcabene. We will continue to undertake preclinical studies to further clarify gemcabene’s involvement in various metabolic pathways.
 Gemcabene Novel Mechanism of Action

 Gemcabene, which has been shown to lower plasma ApoB-lipoprotein concentrations in mice and in humans, appears to regulate remnant receptor via SULF2 in the liver, as illustrated in the diagram below:

 In addition, we believe gemcabene may result in the reduction of inflammation, inflammatory markers and triglycerides (as a result of reduced apoC‑III production) in the plasma of a patient in an inflammatory state. C‑reactive Protein (CRP) is an inflammatory marker protein. CRP levels increase in response to inflammatory states and are associated with medical conditions such as atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, hypertension, obesity, insulin

resistance, and fatty liver disease. CRP expression is regulated by proteins in the nucleus of cells known as nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs). In inflammatory states, cytokines, such as interleukin‑6 (IL‑6) and interleukin (IL1‑β), activate NHRs, such as C/EPB‑β, C/EPB‑δ and nuclear factor kappa B (NF‑κB), and lead them to bind to the CRP promoter and increase CRP mRNA production. Based on preclinical studies, gemcabene may inhibit the interaction of these NHRs on the CRP promoter and therefore reduce CRP mRNA production. Gemcabene has also been shown in preclinical studies to inhibit tissue necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α) induced expression of the inflammatory cytokine IL‑6 in human coronary artery endothelial cells and in a human hepatoma cell line. Overall, gemcabene may not only decrease the expression of CRP, but may also decrease the expression of the inflammatory cytokine IL‑6 resulting in a reduction of inflammation. Gemcabene has been shown to reduce the level of CRP in human clinical trials, to decrease inflammation in a mouse model of arthritis, in a mouse model of NASH, and to decrease pain in a rat model of thermal hyperalgesia.
 The apoC‑III promoter also contains a NF‑κB binding site, and as such, the apoC‑III gene may be upregulated under a chronic inflammatory state. Gemcabene’s ability to reduce apoC‑III mRNA levels may result from gemcabene inhibiting NF‑κB interaction with its binding site on the apoC‑III promoter. We are further exploring this common transcription factor NF‑κB as a binding site for gemcabene to reduce hsCRP and apoC‑III. In contrast, Gemcabene has not been shown to directly or strongly bind to PPARs. See “Additional Studies and Trials.”
 Clinical Experience
 Gemcabene has been assessed in 23 completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. Across these trials, over 1,400 adult subjects have participated, including healthy volunteers and patients with various underlying conditions (see summary table below). Of the subjects, nearly 1,100 have been exposed to at least one dose of gemcabene.
 We believe that gemcabene’s efficacy across the clinical and non-clinical trials support our development plan focused on HoFH, SHTG, NASH, HeFH and, in the future, ASCVD patients. In Phase 2 studies, patients treated with gemcabene were observed to have significantly lowered LDL‑C, hsCRP and triglycerides with results from the trials summarized below:

· | In a four week, double‑blind, multiple dose, Phase 1 trial in 50 healthy subjects (Trial 1027‑003), gemcabene monotherapy doses (450 mg, 600 mg and 900 mg) significantly lowered LDL‑C from baseline by approximately 30%.

· | In an eight week, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, Phase 2 trial in 66 patients with elevated LDL‑C on background stable statin therapy (Trial 1027‑018), both gemcabene doses (300 mg and 900 mg) in combination with statins significantly lowered LDL‑C from baseline by approximately 25% to 31%. Additionally, gemcabene demonstrated reductions in hsCRP of up to 54%.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In an eight week, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, Phase 2 trial in 277 patients with hypercholesterolemia (Trial A4141001), gemcabene monotherapy doses (300 mg, 600 mg and 900 mg) significantly lowered LDL‑C, with the 600 mg and 900 mg doses lowering LDL‑C by approximately 30%. Gemcabene monotherapy doses (600 mg and 900 mg) also significantly lowered hsCRP by approximately 40%.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In a 12‑week, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, Phase 2 trial (Trial 1027‑004), 94 of the 161 patients had elevated triglycerides (≥ 200 mg/dL). For those patients, gemcabene lowered triglycerides in all dose arms, with the 300 mg dose lowering triglycerides by 40%. A post‑hoc analysis of nine patients with severe triglyceride levels (≥500 mg/dL) treated with 150 mg and 300 mg suggest gemcabene has the potential to lower triglycerides by as much as 60%.

· | In a 12-week, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 2 trial (GEM-201, COBALT-1), patients were administered oral gemcabene once daily, with dosage escalating from 300 mg to 600 mg and then 900 mg every 4 weeks, for a total duration of 12 weeks. On various baseline aggressive lipid lowering therapies, the eight FH subjects had a mean baseline LDL-C level of 351 mg/dl prior to add-on gemcabene treatment. Treatment with gemcabene 600 mg, the Company’s target commercial dose, resulted in an LDL-C reduction of approximately 30% for the overall population and approximately 15% and 39% for the HoFH and HeFH subjects, respectively.GEM-201 was designed to assess the LDL-C-lowering efficacy of multiple sequential rising doses of gemcabene in subjects with either genotypic or phenotypic HoFH.

Specifically, all subjects received gemcabene 300 mg QD for 4 weeks, followed by 600 mg QD for 4 weeks, followed by 900 mg QD for 4 weeks. The LDL-C-lowering efficacy of gemcabene was assessed for all subjects as a whole and for subgroups based on LDLr status. In addition, the safety, tolerability, and effects on other lipid and cardiometabolic biomarkers, including hsCRP, were assessed. HoFH was diagnosed by genetic confirmation or a clinical diagnosis based on either (1) a history of an untreated LDL-C concentration > 500 mg/dL (12.92 mmol/L) together with either appearance of xanthoma before 10 years of age, or evidence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) in both parents or, if history was unavailable, (2) LDL-C > 300 mg/dL (7.76 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated lipid lowering drug therapy. Eight adult subjects (3 female and 5 male), with a mean age of 52.8 years and a mean baseline LDL-C of 351.3 mg/dL, received lipid-lowering background therapy included maximum tolerated doses of statin, and/or ezetimibe, evolocumab (a PCSK9 inhibitor), cholestyramine, and fish oil. For the subgroups based on genetically defined LDLr status, 5 subjects were classified as HeFH (defective LDLr status) and 3 subjects were classified as HoFH (LDLr deficient status) according to the completed study genetic evaluation. HoFH subjects with LDLr deficient status had LDLr activity < 2%. All study subjects completed the study. The LS mean percent change from baseline for all subjects was -25.54% (p = 0.0041) on Day 28 for the 300 mg dose level, -29.94% (p = 0.0010) on Day 56 for the 600 mg dose level, and -29.41% (p = 0.0012) on Day 84 for the 900 mg dose level. Secondary efficacy included subgroup analyses for LDL-C according to genetic testing results. The LS mean percent change from baseline in fasting LDL-C was greater in HeFH subjects compared to HoFH subjects for each dose level. The LS mean percent change from baseline in fasting LDL-C in HeFH subjects was -33.97% (p < 0.0001) on Day 28 for the 300 mg dose level, -38.33% (p < 0.0001) on Day 56 for the 600 mg dose level, and -39.22% (p < 0.0001) on Day 84 for the 900 mg dose level. The LS mean percent change from baseline in fasting LDL-C in HoFH subjects was -9.78% on Day 28 for the 300 mg dose level, -14.27% on Day 56 for the 600 mg dose level, and -11.36% on Day 84 for the 900 mg dose level. The LS mean percent change from baseline in fasting LDL-C was not statistically significant at any dose level for the HoFH subgroup.

· | In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial (GEM-301, ROYAL-1) gemcabene produced a mean percent decrease of 17% in LDL-C (vs 5% for placebo) and a median percent decrease of 40% in hsCRP (vs 6% for placebo). Gemcabene reduced LDL-C by 20% and hsCRP by 53% when added to moderate intensity statin therapy. Greater effects were observed in a cardiometabolic population, patients with mixed dyslipidemia, who have a particularly high atherogenic particle burden. In the mixed dyslipidemia group of patients, gemcabene 600 mg demonstrated a placebo adjusted LDL-C reduction of 23% (p < 0.05). Consistent with the mechanism of action of gemcabene, patients with mixed dyslipidemia showed greater reductions in LDL-C, non-HDL-C, ApoB, ApoE and TG of 23%, 19%, 26%, 34% and 33%, respectively.

  From 23 completed clinical trials with nearly 1,100 subjects, including both healthy volunteers and patients, treated with gemcabene, gemcabene was observed to be well tolerated at single doses up to 1,500 mg and multiple doses up to 900 mg/day. Safety of the subjects in these trials was evaluated by AE monitoring, clinical laboratory assessments, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, and vital sign assessments. Across all trials, 10 healthy volunteers or patients reported a treatment‑emergent SAE, none of which were considered by the clinician to be related to gemcabene. No deaths occurred in any of the trials. AEs reported were generally mild to moderate in intensity with the most common events being headache, weakness, nausea, dizziness, upset stomach, infection and abnormal bowel movements. Gemcabene, when compared with placebo, was not associated with an increased incidence of myalgia or liver enzyme elevations, whether as monotherapy or in combination with statin therapy. Elevated levels of liver enzymes, specifically alanine transaminase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), were observed in a few patients (0.23% of gemcabene patients compared to 0.26% of placebo patients had ALT or AST levels more than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN)) returning to baseline after cessation of treatment. Small mean increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been observed in some trials. The increase was reversible with all creatinine values returning to baseline within approximately two weeks of cessation of gemcabene. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in physical examinations or vital signs, including blood pressure.
 In addition, gemcabene demonstrated promising clinical pharmacology attributes across 14 completed Phase 1 trials in healthy subjects, such as once‑daily dosing, no meaningful drug‑drug interactions with high‑intensity statins and no observed food effect. Gemcabene can be taken with or without food. Gemcabene was observed to: (1) be rapidly absorbed following oral administration with time of maximum concentration within two hours and (2) reach maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve over 24 hours (AUC 0‑24) that were dose proportional following

both single‑ and multiple‑dose administration. Steady state concentrations were achieved within six days of repeated dose administration. Average half‑life ranged from 32 to 41 hours. Gemcabene’s primary route of elimination was renal. In addition, no significant drug‑drug interactions were observed with digoxin, a cardiovascular drug for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, atorvastatin and simvastatin, both agents used as background therapy in patients with HoFH, HeFH and ASCVD. Patients with SHTG and NASH often have statin therapy prescribed as well. There were no observed clinically relevant effects on QTc, a measure of cardiac rhythm, and no observed clinically relevant effect on blood pressure. Renal clearance was slightly decreased and was associated with a slight increase in serum creatinine. 
 Based on the results of these trials, we believe gemcabene has the potential to have a differentiated profile as an oral once‑daily, well tolerated adjunct therapy with promising evidence of efficacy in lowering of LDL‑C, hsCRP and triglycerides in patients with dyslipidemia and NASH.  
 Gemcabene Phase 2 Completed Clinical Trials
 Gemcabene has been evaluated in nine Phase 2 trials across a diverse patient population. These trials explored safety, tolerability and efficacy and multiple doses of gemcabene as monotherapy and in combination with low‑, moderate‑ and high‑intensity statins. The table below summarizes our completed Phase 2 clinical trials. Summary of Phase 2 Completed Clinical Trials with Gemcabene

 Gemcabene Phase 2 Trial in Patients with HoFH (COBALT-1)
 This Phase 2 open-label, dose-finding study assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of gemcabene in patients with HoFH on stable, lipid-lowering therapy. COBALT-1 was a 12-week, dose-escalation trial with n=8 patients with a diagnosis of HoFH by genetic confirmation (including heterozygosity) or a clinical diagnosis based on either: (1) A history of an untreated LDL-C concentration >500 mg/dL (12.92 mmol/L) together with either appearance of xanthoma before 10 years of age, or evidence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in both parents; or (2) If history is unavailable, LDL-C >300 mg/dL (7.76 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering drug therapy. Successive escalating doses of 300mg, 600mg, 900mg gemcabene were given every four weeks.
 Efficacy: Patients were administered oral gemcabene once daily, with dosage escalating from 300 mg to 600 mg and then 900 mg every 4 weeks, for a total duration of 12 weeks. On various baseline aggressive lipid lowering therapies, the eight FH subjects had a mean baseline LDL-C level of 351 mg/dl prior to add-on gemcabene treatment. Treatment with gemcabene 600 mg, the Company’s target commercial dose, resulted in an absolute reduction of 93 mg/dL for the overall population and 92 mg/dL and 94 mg/dL for the HoFH and HeFH subjects, respectively. The results for the primary endpoint of mean percent change in LDL-C from baseline at each dose and related time point are presented below.

 As shown the table below, gemcabene impacted multiple secondary endpoints, showing reductions from baseline in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), non-HDL, apoB, apoE, high sensitivity C-Reaction Protein (hsCRP), and other relevant biomarkers. Importantly, gemcabene 600 mg showed a 33% reduction in hsCRP.

 Safety:Safety was assessed by adverse event (AE) monitoring, clinical laboratory assessments, electrocardiograms, physical examinations and vital signs.  AEs were mild to moderate in intensity across all doses of gemcabene and consistent with previously reported AEs. The majority of AEs were gastrointestinal.  There were no serious AEs or withdrawals due to AEs in the COBALT-1 study. There was no evidence of hepatic or muscle injury in the study.
 Gemcabene Phase 2 Trial in Patients with Hypercholesterolemia on High- and Moderate- Intensity Statin Therapy
 ROYAL-1 was designed to largely address the safety of gemcabene in patients on the highest doses of statins. In patients with hypercholesterolemia, despite being on MI and HI statins, gemcabene produced significant reductions in both atherogenic and inflammatory markers without evidence of increased muscle or liver toxicities. A total of 105 hypercholesterolemic patients, including ASCVD or HeFH, were randomized 1:1 to either gemcabene 600 mg or placebo with 50 (24 gemcabene 600 mg; 26 placebo) patients on baseline high-intensity (HI) statins (atorvastatin 40 mg or 80 mg QD; or rosuvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg QD) and 55 (29 gemcabene 600 mg; 26 placebo) patients on baseline moderate-intensity (MI) statins (atorvastatin 10 mg or 20 mg QD; rosuvastatin 5 mg or 10 mg QD; or simvastatin 20 or 40 mg QD). Baseline LDL-C was 127 mg/dL and 134 mg/dL in the MI statin and HI statin stratum, respectively. The double-blind treatment phase of the trial was 12 weeks.
 Efficacy:  Top-line data for ROYAL-1 showed gemcabene produced a mean percent decrease of 17% in LDL-C (vs 5% for placebo) and a median percent decrease of 40% in hsCRP (vs 6% for placebo). Gemcabene reduced LDL-C by 20% and hsCRP by 53% when added to moderate intensity statin therapy. Greater effects were observed in a cardiometabolic population, patients with mixed dyslipidemia, who have a particularly high atherogenic particle burden.  In the mixed dyslipidemia group of patients, gemcabene 600 mg demonstrated a placebo adjusted LDL-C reduction of 23% (p < 0.05). Consistent with the mechanism of action of gemcabene, patients with mixed dyslipidemia showed greater reductions in LDL-C, non-HDL-C, ApoB, ApoE and TG of 23%, 19%, 26%, 34% and 33%, respectively. 
 Safety:Overall, gemcabene was well tolerated with a profile consistent with earlier studies. There were no SAEs and no deaths reported in the study. 33 of 54 patients (61.1%) in the gemcabene group and 24 of 51 patients (47.1%) in the placebo group who reported at least one AE during the study. The most prevalent AEs were those associated with infections. Reported AEs were similar for the MI and HI statin stratums. There was no difference in myalgias between placebo and gemcabene groups. There were no transaminase elevations > 3 x ULN and no clinically significant CK elevations.

 Gemcabene Phase 2 Trial in Patients with Hypercholesterolemia on Stable Statin Therapy (Trial 1027‑018)
 This Phase 2 double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, randomized trial in patients with hypercholesterolemia was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of gemcabene when added to stable statin therapy. A majority of the patients were on moderate‑ to high‑intensity statin therapy for at least three months (high ≈20%, mod ≈60% and low ≈20%). Gemcabene was administered at 300 mg and 900 mg once‑daily for eight weeks. The primary endpoint was median percent change from baseline in LDL‑C. Other endpoints included median percent change from baseline in hsCRP, apoB, total cholesterol, VLDL‑C and triglycerides at Week 8. A total of 66 patients were randomized and 61 patients were evaluated for efficacy. Baseline LDL‑C levels were similar across the treatment arms at approximately 150 mg/dL.
 Efficacy: As presented in the figure below, patients treated with gemcabene were observed to have significantly lowered LDL‑C from baseline at 300 mg and 900 mg by 25% (p=0.005) and 31% (p<0.001), respectively. Patients treated with gemcabene were also observed to have significantly lowered hsCRP, apoB and total cholesterol. At 900 mg, patients treated with gemcabene demonstrated significantly lowered hsCRP by 54% (p<0.001). At 300 mg and 900 mg, patients treated with gemcabene demonstrated significantly lowered apoB by 20% (p=0.033) and 24% (p=0.003), respectively. At 300 mg and 900 mg, patients treated with gemcabene demonstrated significantly lowered total cholesterol by 18% (p=0.008) and 22% (p<0.001), respectively. It was further observed that all four (4) patients treated with 900 mg gemcabene on high‑intensity statins have a mean LDL‑C reduction of 24%. 
 We believe these results support the continued development of gemcabene for the treatment HoFH, HeFH and ASCVD indications on maximally tolerated statins. Classification of statin dose intensity is defined in the 2013 ACC guidelines.

 Safety: Gemcabene was observed to be well tolerated. Patients taking either 300 mg or 900 mg of gemcabene were observed to have a safety profile similar to that of placebo (300 mg: 20%; 900 mg: 23%; placebo: 29%). One patient experienced an SAE in the gemcabene 900 mg treatment arm, which was not considered related to treatment. Three patients (placebo: 2, gemcabene 300 mg: 1) withdrew from the trial due to an AE, all of which were considered possibly related to treatment. AEs reported were generally mild to moderate in intensity. The most frequent AE in the placebo arm was infection (13%). The most frequent AEs in the gemcabene treatment arms were headache (10%) and infection (10%). There were no meaningful changes in liver enzymes ALT and AST. One patient in the 300 mg gemcabene treatment arm had a single laboratory assessment with a rise in creatine kinase of 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN). No clinically meaningful changes in physical examinations or vital signs from baseline to the end of the trial were observed for any patient.
 Gemcabene Phase 2 Trial in Patients with Hypercholesterolemia (Trial A4141001)
 This Phase 2 double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, randomized trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of gemcabene administered as monotherapy, atorvastatin monotherapy or gemcabene initiated simultaneously in combination with atorvastatin in the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia. When applicable, patients were washed out of statins and other lipid‑lowering therapies. Gemcabene was administered as monotherapy once‑daily at 300 mg, 600 mg or 900 mg or in combination with atorvastatin once‑daily at 10 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg. The primary endpoint was percent change in LDL‑C from baseline at Week 8. Secondary endpoints included percent change in hsCRP, apoB, HDL‑C and triglycerides from baseline at Week 8. A total of 277 patients were randomized and 255 patients with at least one post baseline assessment were included in the efficacy analysis. Baseline LDL‑C levels for the evaluable patients after washout were similar across treatment arms at approximately 175 mg/dL.
 Efficacy: As presented in the figure below, patients treated with gemcabene were observed to have significantly lowered LDL‑C by 17% (p=0.0013), 26% (p=0.0001) and 29% (p=0.0001) as monotherapy at 300 mg, 600 mg and 900 mg, respectively. The LDL‑C lowering effect was seen within two weeks and was stable for the duration of the eight week trial. It is important to note that the patients included in this trial were statin responsive (able to reach goal near or below 100 mg/dL) at 10 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg atorvastatin monotherapy. While the trial demonstrated gemcabene provided additional dose dependent LDL‑C lowering (statistically significant at 600 mg and 900 mg when compared to atorvastatin alone), the gemcabene treatment effect was less pronounced due to the patients already being at or below LDL‑C goal of 100 mg/dL on atorvastatin monotherapy. Patients treated with gemcabene were observed to have lowered hsCRP by 26% (p=0.1612), 42% (p=0.0070) and 35% (p=0.0018) as monotherapy at 300 mg, 600 mg and 900 mg, respectively.
 Patients treated with gemcabene in combination with atorvastatin aggregated over the dose range were observed to have mean LDL‑C lowering of 50% (p=0.0852), 52% (p=0.0045) and 54% (p=0.0006) at 300 mg, 600 mg and 900 mg, respectively. Patients treated with gemcabene in combination with atorvastatin aggregated over the dose range were observed to have median hsCRP lowering of 47% (p=0.0237), 54% (p=0.0017) and 60% (p=0.0001) at 300 mg, 600 mg and 900 mg, respectively.
 We believe these results support the continued development of gemcabene for the treatment HoFH, HeFH and ASCVD indications including mixed dyslipidemia.

LDL‑C Mean Percent Change from Baseline in Patients with Hypercholesterolemia
 (with wash‑out of statins)

 Safety: Gemcabene was observed to be well tolerated. Patients taking any dose of gemcabene (300 mg, 600 mg or 900 mg) were observed to have a safety profile similar to that of atorvastatin monotherapy. A similar percentage of patients experienced an associated AE between placebo (18%), atorvastatin monotherapy arms (14%) compared to gemcabene monotherapy (18%) and gemcabene plus atorvastatin treatment arms (17%). Three patients in the gemcabene plus atorvastatin arm experienced a SAE, none of which were considered related to treatment. 16 patients (placebo: 1, atorvastatin monotherapy: 2, gemcabene monotherapy: 6, gemcabene plus atorvastatin: 7) withdrew from the trial due to AEs, nine (atorvastatin monotherapy: 2, gemcabene monotherapy: 4, gemcabene plus atorvastatin: 3) of which were considered possibly related to treatment. AEs reported were generally mild to moderate in intensity. 14 patients (placebo: 1, atorvastatin monotherapy: 2, gemcabene monotherapy: 1, gemcabene plus atorvastatin: 10) reported an AE considered severe in intensity, one (gemcabene plus atorvastatin: 1) of which was considered possibly related to treatment. The most frequently occurring AEs across all treatment arms were infection (8%), pain (6%) and headache (6%). Small mean increases in serum creatinine and BUN were observed in the gemcabene monotherapy arms. One patient treated with 600 mg gemcabene plus atorvastatin had a clinically significant ALT elevation (>3 × ULN on two separate occasions) that returned to near normal levels while treatment continued. No other patient had a pre‑specified clinically significant lab abnormality in ALT, AST, creatinine kinase or serum creatinine. No clinically meaningful changes in physical examinations or vital signs from baseline to the end of the trial were observed for any patient. The AEs experienced by more than 10% of patients in any treatment group are summarized below.

 Gemcabene Phase 2 Trial in Patients with Elevated Triglycerides (Trial 1027‑004)
 This Phase 2 double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, randomized trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of gemcabene in patients with low HDL‑C and either normal or elevated triglycerides. Gemcabene was administered at 150, 300, 600 and 900 mg once‑daily for 12 weeks. The objectives of this trial were to evaluate percentage change from baseline in HDL‑C, LDL‑C, triglycerides and other lipids and apolipoprotein variables at Week 12. A total of 161 patients were randomized. At baseline, 67 patients were normotriglyceridemic (<200 mg/dL) and 94 patients were hypertriglyceridemic (≥200 mg/dL). Baseline triglycerides were approximately 370 mg/dL across the treatment arms with hypertriglyceridemia with the exception of the 600 mg treatment arm (580 mg/dL). A total of 155 patients (89 hypertriglyceridemic patients) had a post randomization assessment to be evaluated for efficacy. Baseline LDL‑C levels for the evaluable patients, regardless of the triglyceride stratum, were similar across the treatment arms at approximately 110 mg/dL.
 Efficacy: As presented in the figure below, patients with triglyceride levels greater than 200 mg/dL (hypertriglyceridemic patients), treated with gemcabene at 150 mg and 300 mg were observed to have lowered triglycerides by 27% (p=0.002) and 39% (p<0.001), respectively compared to baseline. Although patients treated with gemcabene at 600 mg and 900 mg were observed to have lower triglycerides, the lowering effect was not significant when compared to placebo. Therefore, the anticipated dose for treatment of patients with elevated triglyceride levels is 150 mg or 300 mg. Notably, patients treated with gemcabene were observed to have significantly lowered LDL‑C by 19% (p<0.001) and 20% (p<0.001) at 600 mg and 900 mg, respectively, compared to baseline.
 A post‑hoc analysis of the nine patients with severe triglyceride levels (≥500 mg/dL; baseline means of two weeks prior and time zero was approximately 600 mg/dL) treated with 150 mg and 300 mg suggest gemcabene has the potential to lower triglycerides by as much as 60%.
 We believe these results support the continued development of gemcabene for the treatment SHTG and ASCVD patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

 Triglyceride Median Percent Change from Baseline at Week 12 in Patients with High to Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

 Safety: Gemcabene was observed to be well tolerated. Patients taking any dose of gemcabene (150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg or 900 mg) were observed to have a safety profile similar to that of placebo. Fewer patients experienced an associated AE in the placebo arm (9%) compared to gemcabene treatment arms (17%). Three patients (placebo: 1, gemcabene: 2) experienced SAEs, none of which were considered related to treatment. Six patients (placebo: 2, gemcabene: 4) withdrew from the trial due to AEs, four (placebo: 1, gemcabene: 3) of which were considered possibly related to treatment. AEs reported were generally mild to moderate in intensity. Two patients (placebo: 1, gemcabene: 1) reported an AE considered severe in intensity. The most frequent AEs in the placebo arm were infection (16%), accidental injury (6%), back pain (6%), dyspepsia (6%), headache (6%) and sinusitis (6%). The most frequently observed AEs in the gemcabene arms were infection (12%), headache (7%) and asthenia (5%). Two patients had ALT values that met the definition of a clinically important laboratory abnormality (placebo: 1, 600 mg gemcabene: 1). One patient had elevated BUN values considered clinically significant (600 mg gemcabene: 1). All of these laboratory abnormalities were considered mild to moderate. No clinically meaningful changes in physical examinations or vital signs from baseline to the end of the trial were observed for any patient. Gemcabene Phase 1 Clinical Trials
 Gemcabene has been evaluated in ten completed Phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers. These trials explored safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and dose response as monotherapy and in combination with high‑intensity statin doses and other drugs. The table below summarizes our completed Phase 1 trials. Select trials are described in more detail below.

A4141002 | Trial to determine the potential drug‑drug interactions of atorvastatin with gemcabene | 300, 900 mg (with 80 mg atorvastatin) | GEM = 20 | 22 Days 
A4141003 | Trial to evaluate the effect of gemcabene on QT interval | 900 mg | GEM = 20 | 8 Days 
A4141005 | Trial to evaluate the effect of gemcabene on the glomerular filtration rate | 900 mg (with 3,235 mg lohexol) | GEM = 12 | 10 Days 

      Note:One trial (A4141006; 23 volunteers) was stopped prior to completion as a result of discontinuation of the program. The trial was designed to evaluate multiple fixed‑dose combinations of gemcabene with atorvastatin.
 Gemcabene Phase 1 Drug‑Drug Interaction Trials to Assess PK on Statins (Trials 1027‑008 and A4141002)
 Two open‑label, multiple‑dose, Phase 1 trials were conducted to assess PK of gemcabene in combination with high‑intensity statins. In Trial 1027‑008, 900 mg of gemcabene was co‑administered with 80 mg simvastatin in 20 healthy volunteers. In Trial A4141002, 300 mg and 900 mg of gemcabene were co‑administered with 80 mg atorvastatin in 20 healthy volunteers. In both trials, treatment with gemcabene in combination with statins was observed to be well tolerated by volunteers. Furthermore, as presented in the figures below, the PK profiles with and without 900 mg gemcabene were observed to be similar, suggesting no clinically relevant drug‑drug interactions with either 80 mg simvastatin or 80 mg atorvastatin.

 Gemcabene Preclinical Studies
 As part of a comprehensive nonclinical toxicology program, over 30 exploratory and definitive single and repeated‑dose toxicity studies with gemcabene were conducted in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. There are very few outstanding nonclinical studies needed for registration such as two‑year carcinogenicity studies in rodents and juvenile toxicology. Gemcabene was well tolerated in these completed studies, including a 26‑week repeat dose study in rats and monkeys and 52‑week repeat dose study in monkeys. The completed studies support conducting clinical trials up to six months.
 In multiple preclinical efficacy studies, gemcabene was observed to have lowering effects on plasma LDL‑C, triglycerides and anti‑inflammatory markers in diet‑induced and genetic preclinical models of dyslipidemia.
 In Vivo Proof of Principle Study for HoFH
 In LDL‑receptor deficient mice, gemcabene at 60 mg/kg/day was observed to reduce LDL‑C up to 55% as monotherapy and 72% in combination with statins. This dose in mice is equivalent to approximately a 450 mg gemcabene tablet per day in humans. This LDL‑receptor deficient animal model has been reported in literature to be fairly predictive of HoFH therapies in practice. For example, statin lowering of approximately 20% in LDL‑receptor deficient‑mice model correlates well to the approximately 15% to 20% LDL‑C lowering observed in HoFH patients, and Juxtapid lowering of approximately 50% to 80% in LDL‑receptor deficient‑rabbits model correlates well to the approximately 40% to 50% in HoFH patients.

 In Vivo Proof of Principle for Hepatic Triglyceride Reduction 
 Gemcabene was studied in a chow-fed Sprague-Dawley rat model to explore the effects on fat content in the liver. The results of gemcabene 10 and 30 mg/kg/day doses in this rat model were similar to gemfibrozil. Gemcabene treatment significantly reduced hepatic triglycerides by 74% in chow-fed Sprague-Dawley rats. Hepatic Lipids in Male Sprague-Dawley Rats Treated with Gemfibrozil or Gemcabene

 In Vivo Proof of Concept for NASH (STAM Murine Model of NASH and Hepatocellular Carcinoma)    NASH was induced in 40 male mice by a single subcutaneous injection of 200 µg streptozotocin solution 2 days after birth and feeding with a high fat diet. Histological analyses of the liver were the key endpoints for the determination of an effect of gemcabene in this preclinical model of NASH. NASH is defined by the presence and pattern of specific histological abnormalities on liver biopsy. The NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) is a composite score that was developed as a tool to measure changes in NAFLD during therapeutic trials. NAS is a composite score comprised of three components that includes scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning. NAS was defined as the unweighted sum of the scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning. Steatosis grade is quantified as the percentage of hepatocytes that contain fat droplets. The fibrosis stage of the liver is evaluated separately from NAS by histological evaluation of the intensity of sirius red staining of collagen in the pericentral region of liver lobules. NAS scores of 0-2 are not considered diagnostic for NASH, NAS scores of 3-4 are considered either not diagnostic, borderline or positive for NASH, while NAS scores of 5-8 are largely considered diagnostic for NASH. A treatment effect for NASH is based on differences in both NAS and fibrosis levels.

 The gemcabene 30 and 300 mg/kg groups and telmisartan group (included as a positive control) showed significant reduction in NAS compared with the Vehicle in NASH group. Since gemcabene reduced steatosis and ballooning scores, the data suggested that gemcabene improved NASH pathology by inhibiting hepatocyte damage and ballooning cell formation.
 STAM Model NAFLD Activity Score (NAS)

 Sirius red-stained liver sections were evaluated to determine liver fibrosis. Liver sections from the Vehicle in NASH group showed increased collagen deposition in the pericentral region of liver lobule compared with the Vehicle in Normal group. All gemcabene groups showed significant decreases in fibrosis area compared with the Vehicle in NASH group.

 Additionally, hepatic gene expression and plasma markers indicative of inflammation (e.g., CRP and CCR2/CCR5), and lipid modulation (e.g., ApoC-III and ACC1) were significantly reduced as were other markers, as displayed in the table below. Gemcabene demonstrated proof of concept on NAS score and fibrosis, supporting further development in the clinic. Gemcabene Clinical Development Plan
 In June and September 2015, Gemphire received FDA feedback from its Type C meetings related to the development of gemcabene for the treatment of patients with HoFH. The FDA indicated that historically LDL‑C has been accepted as a surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular risk reduction for lipid‑altering drugs to support traditional approval, including patients with HoFH. The FDA reiterated weighing the magnitude of LDL‑C reduction in light of the drug’s safety profile (e.g., benefit/risk) when using a surrogate endpoint such as LDL‑C. Our investigational new drug application (IND) was submitted to the FDA in December 2015 and is in effect. We have also received approvals to initiate studies in the dyslipidemic indications in Canada and Israel.
 We initiated three late stage clinical trials in dyslipidemia in 2016, and we initiated two Phase 2a trials in NASH/NAFLD in late 2017 and early 2018. With the completion of the COBALT and ROYAL trials last year, we are preparing for our EOP2 meeting with the FDA to discuss the design and scope of the Phase 3 registration trials and long‑term safety exposure needed for registration. These long-terms exposure trials will require that the FDA lift its partial clinical hold on gemcabene, which would occur as soon as the agency reviews our report on the 2-year rodent carcinogenicity study for which the in-life portion was completed this past October. We would expect to launch our first Phase 3 registration trial in 2018 for a targeted indication. The development programs for our targeted indications are described below. The in‑vitro drug transport studies have been completed in accordance with FDA guidelines, and we expect to conduct a few additional clinical pharmacology Phase 1 trials to support registration.
 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH): COBALT Program
 The clinical development program for HoFH patients is expected to include the 25 completed and ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials.  Additionally, we anticipate a limited clinical trial program to support HoFH registration.  It is anticipated that the program will consist of the following: 1) GEM-202, is a 12-week double-blind, placebo‑controlled study in HoFH subjects older than 12; 2) GEM-205 is an open-label study in subjects on background LDL apheresis to assess PK and PD; and 3) GEM-204, an open-label extension study to GEM-202 and GEM-205. 
 After EOP2 discussions with the FDA and other regulatory agencies we will be able to better define the Phase 3 registration trials and long-term safety exposure needed for registration

 Hypercholesterolemia, HeFH and ASCVD: ROYAL Program
 The clinical development program for adult patients with hypercholesterolemia (including HeFH, ASCVD, ASCVD with mixed dyslipidemia and statin-intolerant patients) with elevated LDL‑C levels while on maximally tolerated high‑intensity statin therapy is expected to include the 25 completed and ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies followed by Phase 3 registration trials. Current precedent for this high-risk population of patients is that reductions in LDL-C is an acceptable surrogate for registration.  
 After EOP2 discussions with the FDA and other regulatory agencies, we believe we will be able to better define the Phase 3 registration trials and long‑term safety exposure needed for registration.
 SHTG: INDIGO Program
 The clinical development program for adult patients with SHTG with elevated triglyceride levels is expected to include the 25 completed and ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies, including GEM‑401 (INDIGO-1), followed by Phase 3 registration trials. 
 INDIGO-1 is a 12 week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG) (TG≥500mg/dL) with or without statin therapy. The study has completed enrollment of 90 subjects into one of three arms, gemcabene 300 mg, gemcabene 600 mg and placebo. The primary endpoint will be TG lowering from baseline after 12 weeks. Other endpoints will include LDL‑C, hsCRP, apoB, non HDL‑C, VLDL and total cholesterol. Safety of these patients will be assessed by AE monitoring, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, physical examinations and vital sign assessments. We announced that enrollment completed in January 2018 and top-line data is expected in the second quarter of 2018.
 After completion of the Phase 2 trial and after EOP2 discussions with the FDA and other regulatory agencies, we believe we will be able to better define the Phase 3 registration trials and long‑term safety exposure needed for registration.
 NASH/NAFLD Program
 The clinical development program NASH/NAFLD patients is expected to include the 25 completed and ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials.  In addition, there are two ongoing proof-of concept Phase 2a studies to evaluate gemcabene in NASH/NAFLD subjects and these studies are described below. 
     Pediatric NAFLD: Phase 2a Clinical Trial 
     In January 2018, the Company announced that it had initiated a Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial investigating gemcabene as a treatment for pediatric NAFLD.  The open label trial is expected to enroll approximately 40 adolescent children between the ages of 12 and 17 who are diagnosed with NAFLD and abnormal liver function as assessed by liver transaminases.  Patients will receive gemcabene at a dose of 300 mg once daily.  The primary endpoint is a measure of the change in serum alanine transaminase, an enzyme that serves as a biomarker of liver function, from baseline to 12 weeks.  Secondary endpoints include change in hepatic steatosis as measured by non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging – proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), change in liver inflammation and fibrosis score by non-invasive MRI liver multiscan, change in AST, insulin sensitivity, serum lipids (including triglycerides), apolipoproteins, and inflammatory markers (including hsCRP) as well as safety and tolerability.  Top line results from the pediatric NAFLD trial are expected in early 2019.           Adult NASH in Familial Partial Lipodystrophy (FPL): Phase 2a Clinical Trial 
     In December 2017, the Company announced that it had initiated a Phase 2a study to assess the efficacy and safety of two dosing regimens of gemcabene in FPL patients with elevated triglycerides and NAFLD.  The primary objective of this Phase 2a study is to assess the efficacy and safety of two dosing regimens of gemcabene in up to eight FPL patients with elevated triglycerides and NAFLD.  Patients will be randomized to two treatment groups, to receive either gemcabene 300 mg once daily for 24 weeks or gemcabene 300 mg once daily for 12 weeks immediately followed by gemcabene 600 mg once daily for an additional 12 weeks. The trial’s primary endpoint is the reduction in triglycerides after 12 weeks of treatment.  Secondary endpoints will include measures of liver fat (MRI-PDFF) and NAS (histology) at 24 weeks. Patients who are considered responders (i.e., defined as triglycerides lowering > 30% at Week 12) will be offered the opportunity for long-term therapy with gemcabene in a separate open-label extension study.  We anticipate top line results from the trial in the second half of 2018.

 
  36

 

 After completion of the Phase 2a trials, the company expects to discuss the data with the FDA and other regulatory agencies.  After these meetings, the company will better be able to define the clinical development pathway in NASH/NAFLD. 
 Additional Studies and Trials
 Studies in Response to Partial Clinical Hold for Compounds in PPAR Class
 Peroxisome proliferation‑activated receptor (PPAR) agonists are natural ligands or drugs which bind to PPARs and turn on or off PPAR responsive genes in the cell nucleus. PPARs comprises three subtypes, PPARα, PPARγ and PPARβ (also referred to as PPARδ). When the PPARs are activated by natural or pharmaceutical molecules, those molecules can regulate (turn‑off or turn‑on) the transcription (making messenger RNA) of genes that regulate the storage and mobilization of lipids (fats), glucose metabolism, and inflammatory responses. PPARα and PPARγ are the molecular targets of a number of marketed drugs to treat metabolic syndrome including lowering triglycerides and cholesterol such as fibrate drugs and to treat diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance such as thiazolidinedione drugs.
 Beginning in 2004, the FDA began issuing partial clinical holds to all sponsors of PPARs or agents deemed to have PPAR‑like properties from preclinical studies. The FDA takes the position that preclinical data suggest PPAR agonists are carcinogenic in rodents. In 2004, the FDA determined that gemcabene was a PPAR agonist and issued a partial clinical hold. Our current IND is subject to the same partial clinical hold. The partial clinical hold permits clinical trials of up to six months for gemcabene and also requires us to conduct two‑year rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies before conducting clinical trials of longer than six months. Our two‑year rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies are underway and the in-life portion of the studies were completed in Q4 2017. Thereafter, multiple tissues samples will be analyzed to complete draft audited data reports. These reports are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018 for submission to the FDA for review.
 We believe the apparent PPARα effects observed in rodents (such as peroxisome proliferation and elevation of liver weight) are likely rodent‑specific phenomena. Based on historical nonclinical and clinical experience on these type of compounds, we believe rodents share little apparent relevance for human risk assessment. In a recently completed PPAR agonist receptor binding assays we observed essentially no gemcabene direct binding to the mouse, rat, or human PPARα, PPARβ, or PPARγ receptors, whereas reference agents for each of the receptors showed the expected binding, including marketed PPARα agents, such as fibrates, including gemfibrozil. We believe the PPARα responses in rats and mice are secondary and perhaps related to the mobilization or formation of a naturally occurring molecule that binds to PPARα in response to gemcabene administration.
 Cardiovascular Outcomes Trials
 We believe it is well accepted that every 1.6 mg/dL lowering of LDL‑C through the cholesterol synthesis pathway results in a 1% lowering of cardiovascular disease risk. The FDA has not required any approved therapy targeting LDL‑C lowering, including non‑statin therapies, to initiate or complete a cardiovascular outcomes trial in connection with its approval of HoFH, HeFH and ASCVD therapies. Based on recent drug approvals, we believe it is unlikely that the FDA will require us to initiate or complete a cardiovascular outcomes trial for any of the targeted indications, although we would plan to initiate a cardiovascular outcomes trial, for illustration in high‑risk ASCVD patients with mixed dyslipidemia, prior to NDA filing to pursue broader label indications related to cardiovascular disease risk reduction. Notwithstanding our current expectations, the FDA could require us to initiate or complete a cardiovascular outcomes trial as a condition to filing or approving an NDA for gemcabene. Future In‑licensing and Acquisition Opportunities
 Our scientific team is well‑qualified to identify, in‑license or acquire, and develop additional product candidates to diversify our pipeline and generate long‑term growth. We continually evaluate and prioritize interesting product candidates based on scientific merit, regulatory pathways, and commercial differentiation. Our focus is on cardiometabolic product candidates. Sales and Marketing
 Given our current stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities, nor have we entered into any partnership or co‑promotion arrangements with an established pharmaceutical company. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure to launch gemcabene in the United States, if approved, 

 
  37

 
for the narrower indications of HoFH, we may build out a specialty sales force to reach a concentrated number of approximately 50 lipid centers and 500 lipidologists across the country. This would require additional financial and managerial resources. We may co-promote the SHTG indication with a partner or use a contract sales force along with our internal sales force and distributor(s). We may engage in partnering discussions with third parties from time to time. As we further develop and seek approval as well as launch commercial sales of gemcabene outside of the United States or for broader patient populations in the United States, including patients with NASH, HeFH, and ASCVD, we may establish partnerships with one or more pharmaceutical company collaborators, depending on, among other things, the applicable indications, the related costs and our available resources.
 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC)
 Gemcabene is a small molecule drug candidate that can be synthesized as a single polymorph crystalline monocalcium salt, using readily available raw materials and based on conventional chemical processes.
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely on contract manufacturers to produce both the drug substance and drug product amounts required for our preclinical studies and clinical trials under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), a quality system regulating CMC activities. 
 Since 2015 to date, research and development performed for both drug substance and drug product resulted in a manufacturing process utilized for the production of clinical supply for on-going clinical trials. More specifically, drug substance and drug product process and analytical development have been completed in compliance with the FDA guidelines for Phase 2 clinical trials, and on-going activities are directed to process and method validations for compliance with Phase 3 clinical trials. In addition, our drug product manufacturer has sufficient analytical and process development data to support the manufacture of tablets of various strengths. On-going stability studies for both the drug substance and drug product currently support more than two years of shelf life, sufficient for this stage of development. CMC activities are also oriented towards the initiation of the production of the registration stability lots and validations to support NDA filing and regulatory approvals necessary for the commercial stage.
 Our contract manufacturers are currently producing, and will produce in the future, our bulk drug substance and drug product for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials on a purchase order basis, and do not have any long term arrangements. We intend to identify and qualify our current manufacturers as well as alternative manufacturers to provide bulk drug substance and drug product prior to the NDA submission to the FDA to ensure the regulatory support necessary for multiple manufacturing sites in order to supply sufficient commercial quantities at the drug launch and forward. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our drug substances and drug product candidates, if approved for marketing by the applicable regulatory authorities.
 Pfizer License Agreement 
 In April 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Pfizer (the Pfizer Agreement) for a worldwide exclusive license to certain patent rights to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import the clinical product candidate gemcabene. In exchange for this license, we agreed to issue shares of our common stock to Pfizer representing 15% of our fully diluted capital at the close of the first arms‑length series A financing, which occurred on March 31, 2015.
 We agreed to make milestone payments totaling up to $37 million upon the achievement of certain milestones, including the first regulatory submission in any country, regulatory approval in each of the United States, Europe and Japan, the first anniversary of the first regulatory approval in any country, and upon achieving certain aggregate sales levels of gemcabene or any product containing gemcabene. Future milestone payments under the Pfizer Agreement, if any, are not expected to begin before at least late 2019 and extend over a number of subsequent years.
 We have also agreed to pay Pfizer tiered royalties on a country‑by‑country basis based upon the annual amount of net sales as specified in the Pfizer Agreement until expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights, including any patent term extensions or supplemental protection certificates. The royalty rates range from the high single digits to the low teens depending on the level of net sales. Under the Pfizer Agreement we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize gemcabene.

 
  38

 

 The Pfizer Agreement will expire upon expiration of the last royalty term. Either party may terminate the Pfizer Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach and specified bankruptcy events. Pfizer may terminate the Pfizer Agreement if we or any of our sublicensees challenge the validity, enforceability or ownership of the licensed patents. Additionally, Pfizer may revoke the license if we are unable to adequately commercialize gemcabene by April 2021.
 Intellectual Property
 Our patent estate includes patents and/or patent applications to forms of gemcabene, methods of using gemcabene, and methods of manufacturing gemcabene. The patent estate includes patents licensed from Pfizer and additional patents and applications that have been filed subsequent to obtaining the license that are entirely owned by Gemphire. Charles Bisgaier, a co-founder of Gemphire, is an inventor on thirteen of the pending fifteen patent families. As of February 26, 2018, Gemphire’s patent estate, including patents we own or license from third parties, on a worldwide basis, included five issued U.S. patents, sixteen pending U.S. patent applications, 41 issued patents in foreign jurisdictions including Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Mexico and Spain and 29 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions including Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan and Mexico. Of our worldwide patents and pending applications, all relate to our product candidate gemcabene.
 U.S. Patent number 6,861,555, which was in‑licensed from Pfizer, includes claims directed to the calcium salt crystal form of gemcabene that is used in our clinical formulations and will constitute the commercial product as well as other crystalline forms of gemcabene. This patent is expected to expire in 2021; however, we may select this patent for patent term extension from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) if such an extension is available. Given the expected length of the regulatory review, the expiry date of this patent may be extended to 2023, or possibly 2024. Assuming market approval of gemcabene in 2019, data exclusivity would provide exclusivity for gemcabene out to about 2024. Furthermore, and importantly in our case, the FDA orphan designation for HoFH may provide us seven years of market exclusivity for gemcabene in the United States for HoFH. This market exclusivity would provide protection for gemcabene for treating HoFH out to about 2026. Related foreign patents, which have issued in jurisdictions including Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Japan, Mexico and New Zealand, are expected to expire in 2021, absent any adjustments or extensions.
 U.S. Patent Number 8,557,835, which was also in‑licensed from Pfizer, includes claims directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprised of combinations of gemcabene with statins and methods of using a combination of gemcabene on top of a statin in a patient that does not reach sufficient LL-C lowering on a statin alone, for treating several conditions including hyperlipidemia. This patent is expected to expire in 2021, absent any extension. Related foreign patents, which have issued in jurisdictions including Mexico, and Singapore are expected to expire in 2018, absent any adjustments or extensions.
 U.S. Patent No. 8,846,761, which is owned by Gemphire, includes claims directed to methods of reducing risk of pancreatitis for patients with TG≥ 500 mg/dL with gemcabene treatment. This patent is expected to expire in 2032, absent any extension. Foreign patents have issued in Australia, Japan, Mexico and Europe. The European patent was validated into 21 European countries. Foreign counterpart patent applications are pending in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong and Mexico, and any patents issuing from such applications are expected to expire in 2031, absent any adjustments or extensions.
 U.S. patent application number 14/370,722, which we own, is directed to methods of decreasing a patient’s risk for developing coronary heart disease or preventing, delaying or reducing the severity of a secondary cardiovascular event by administering gemcabene with a statin. This application is granted in Australia and related patent applications are pending in foreign jurisdictions including Canada, China, Europe, Japan and Mexico. Any patent that may issue in this family, absent any patent term adjustment or extension, is expected to expire in 2033.
 In 2015-2017, we filed, filed U.S. patent application number 14/942,765 and 14 foreign non‑provisional patent applications on methods of large scale manufacturing for making dicarboxyalkyl ethers. Any patent issuing from this patent family is expected to expire in 2035. In addition, in 2017, we filed U.S. provisional patent applications of which 62/477,831, 62/578,782, 62/467,407, 62/486,822, 62,486,728, 62/569,358, 62/584,576, 62/505,085, 62/560,540, 62/560,888 and in 2018 we filed 62/624,564, all of which are pending.  In 2017, we also filed two PCT applications one for methods of treating mixed dyslipidemia using gemcabene in combination with statins and treatment of NASH using gemcabene as a monotherapy (PCT/US2016/060837), and the other relating to fixed dose combinations and 

 
  39

 
modified release formulations of gemcabene and statins (PCT/US2016/060849) which will be nationized. Two U.S. Patent Applications were filed as continuations of PCT/US2016/060837 and one as a divisional. U.S. Patent Application Number 15/416,911, now U.S. 9,849,104, is directed to methods of treating NASH by administering gemcabene as a monotherapy, U.S. Patent Application Number 15/424,620, is directed methods for treating Mixed Dyslipidemia by administering gemcabene and a statin, and divisional U.S. Patent Application Number 15/814,118 directed to other aspects of NASH. Any patent that may issue in either of these two families, absent any patent term adjustment or extension, is expected to expire in 2037.  
 As background, the patent term is typically 20 years from the date of filing a non‑provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened several ways. First, patent term adjustment (PTA) compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent. Second, in certain instances, a patent term extension (PTE) can be granted to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, as provided under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch‑Waxman Act. This restoration period cannot be longer than five years for approval of a drug compound, and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the PTE and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within 60 days from market approval. Independent of patent protection, in the United States, the Hatch‑Waxman Act provides a five‑year period of non‑patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity (NCE). Under this provision, gemcabene may be eligible for up to five years of data and market exclusivity under the Hatch‑Waxman Act, because it is considered a NCE because the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the active ingredient of gemcabene. In Europe, under the Data Exclusivity Directive, pharmaceutical companies may receive up to 11 years to market their product without risk of competition. In Japan, under the Pharmaceuticals Act of Japan, the market authorization holder, based on the length of a required study period reexamination, may have up to 10 years before a generic can enter the market.
 Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant innovation and change. The market for lipid regulating therapies is especially large and competitive. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. Gemcabene, if approved, will face intense competition. Key competitive factors affecting its commercial success will include efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. Although there are currently no approved therapies for NASH, the market for NASH is continuing to evolve with many drug candidates in late stage development.
 Statins are the most commonly used therapy to lower LDL‑C in the dyslipidemia market. They are used by patients with HoFH as well as HeFH and ASCVD. Branded statins include AstraZeneca’s Crestor (rosuvastatin), Merck’s Zocor (simvastatin) and Pfizer’s Lipitor (atorvastatin) among others. Generic statins are marketed by several companies including Apotex Inc., Mylan N.V. (Mylan), Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. and Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Lupin) among others.
 Non‑statin based therapies are also used to lower LDL‑C in dyslipidemia patients. Merck’s Zetia (ezetimibe) is a common non‑statin therapy that is often combined with statins for HoFH, HeFH and ASCVD patients. Merck’s Vytorin and Liptruzet are fixed‑dose combination therapies that combine ezetimibe with statins. Non‑statin therapies are combined with statins to improve LDL‑C lowering or to offer other efficacy benefits, including Daiichi Sankyo Inc.’s (Daiichi Sankyo) Welchol, a bile acid sequestrant and niacin. Non‑statin therapies are also used to treat HoFH. These therapies include Aegerion’s Juxtapid, a once‑daily oral microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor and Ionis and Genzyme Corporation’s, a Sanofi Company (Genzyme), Kynamro, a once‑weekly injectable apoB antisense therapy. These agents have boxed warnings associated with liver toxicity and significant tolerability issues on their labels. Amgen’s Repatha, an injectable PCSK9 inhibitor, was recently approved for HoFH, HeFH and ASCVD, and Sanofi’s and Regeneron’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, was recently approved for HeFH and ASCVD.
 There are multiple product candidates in late stage development for HoFH, HeFH and ASCVD. Regeneron’s evinacumab (completed Phase 2) is in development for the treatment of HoFH. For hypercholesterolemia, including HeFH and ASCVD, drugs in development include oral CETPi, Merck’s anacetrapib (recently discontinued Phase 3), Eli Lilly and Company’s evacetrapib (recently discontinued Phase 3), and Amgen/Dezima’s TA‑8995 (Phase 2), current Esperion’s oral product, Bempedoic Acid (Phase 3), The Medicines Company/Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s

(Alnylam) injectable PCSK9 inhibitor, ALN‑PCSsc (completed Phase 2), Eli Lilly’s injectable PCSK9 inhibitor, LY3015014 (Phase 2), and Pfizer’s injectable PCSK9 inhibitor bococizumab (recently discontinued Phase 3).
 The market for LDL lowering therapy is both large and competitive, and the diagram below depicts the opportunity for gemcabene in 2nd line oral therapy, especially with discontinuation of competing oral CETPi and injectable PCSK9 inhibitor.
 Competitive LDL‑C Lowering Landscape

 Fibrates, niacin and prescription fish oil are common therapies used to lower triglycerides in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Examples of branded fibrates include AbbVie Inc.’s (AbbVie) Tricor and Trilipix, and an example of a branded niacin includes AbbVie’s Niaspan, an extended‑release niacin. In addition, AbbVie markets combination therapies, such as Advicor (niacin extended release and lovastatin) and Simcor (niacin extended release and simvastatin). Prescribed generic versions of fibrates, such as gemfibrozil, are manufactured by many companies including Impax Laboratories, Inc. (Impax), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Teva), Mylan and Lupin among others. Generic versions of niacins are manufactured by many companies including Teva, Lupin and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA), Inc., among others. Commonly used prescription fish oils include GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GlaxoSmithKline) Lovaza, AstraZeneca’s Epanova and Amarin’s Vascepa. Drugs that are in development for SHTG include Ionis’ volanesorsen (Phase 2).
 Currently there are currently no approved therapies for NASH and older medications are written off label to treat the disease. There are currently more than thirty assets in various stages of development for NASH. Several drug candidates are in late stage development and may be approved for the NASH indication as soon as 2019/2020: OCALIVA (Obeticholic Acid) (FXR Agonist) being developed by Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Elafibranor (PPAR Agonist) being developed by Genfit SA, Selonsertib (formerly GS-4997) (ASK-1 Inhibitor) being developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., GS-0976 (ACC Inhibitor) being developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., Cenicriviroc (CVC) (CCR2/CCR5 Inhibitor) being developed by Tobira Therapeutics, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan plc), Emricasan (Caspase Inhibitor) being developed by Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc., Aramchol (Synthetic Fatty Acid/Bile Acid Conjugate)

being developed by Galmed, GR-MD-02 (Galectin-3 Inhibitor) being developed by Galectin Therapeutics, and MGL-3196 (THR Agonist) being developed by Madrigal.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities at the federal, state and local level in the United States and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture (including any manufacturing changes), packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. United States — FDA Regulation
 FDA Approval Process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions by the FDA, including FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, partial or full clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission of an investigational new drug application (IND) to the FDA, which must become effective before clinical trials may commence, and adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of the FDA’s pre‑market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical studies must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices, or GLP. The results of preclinical studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, available clinical data, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical studies, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 Once the IND is submitted, the sponsor must wait 30 calendar days before initiating any clinical trials. During this time, FDA has an opportunity to review the IND for safety to assure that research subjects will not be subjected to unreasonable risk., unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (1) in compliance with federal regulations; (2) in compliance with good clinical practice (GCP), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (3) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is either not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The clinical trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB, for approval. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions.

 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap.

· | Phase 1 trials: The drug is initially introduced into healthy volunteers or patients, with the target disease or condition. The drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2 trials: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, optimum dosage and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3 trials: If the drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 trials, Phase 3 trials, including registration trials, are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit‑risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well‑controlled Phase 3 registration trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 registration trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and, more frequently, if SAEs occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all.
 After completion of the required clinical trials, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include, among other things, the results of all preclinical studies, clinical trials and other testing, a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls, and the proposed product labeling. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,374,000 for fiscal year 2016, and the manufacturer and/or applicant under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $114,000 per product and $585,000 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of diseases or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited only for drugs intended to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease relative to the currently approved products. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late‑submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee — typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts — for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it is compliant with cGMP, is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require 

 
  43

 
substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, or require that post‑approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may also require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use. Elements to assure safe use can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post‑approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that the FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 Under the fast track program and the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life‑threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post‑marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post‑approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post‑approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post‑marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by FDA.
 In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

 
  44

 

 Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that the FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. Even if a product qualifies for this program, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification. Orphan Drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition — generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven‑year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven‑year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers for submission of data, as well as deferrals for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) provides NDA holders a six‑month extension of any exclusivity — patent or non‑patent — for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 Special Protocol Assessment
 A company may reach an agreement with the FDA under the Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) process as to the required design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim and adequately addresses scientific and regulatory requirements indicating concurrence by FDA with the adequacy and acceptability to support the ability of a future submitted application to meet regulatory
 requirements for approval. Under the FDC Act and FDA guidance implementing the statutory requirement, an SPA is generally binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy after the clinical trial begins, public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, the sponsor and FDA agree to the change in writing, or if the clinical trial sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA.

 
  45

 

 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA‑regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly‑available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post‑approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post‑approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct‑to‑consumer advertising, off‑label promotion, industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 AE reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post‑marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality‑control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality‑control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient in the same strength, route of administration and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical trials to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method‑of‑use rather than certify to a listed method‑of‑use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within

45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
 Exclusivity
 Upon NDA approval of a drug containing a NCE, which is a drug substance that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that moiety will receive five years of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that moiety. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, may receive a three‑year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change.
 If no Paragraph IV certification is made, an ANDA may not be filed until expiry of the NCE exclusivity period, however, if a Paragraph IV certification is filed, the ANDA may be submitted one year before the NCE exclusivity period expires. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
 Patent Term Extension
 After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase — the time between IND application and NDA submission — and all of the review phase — the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The extension may not extend the patent beyond 14 years from market approval.
 For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post‑approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the USPTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 Prescription Drug Marketing Act
 As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) imposes requirements and limitations upon the provision of drug samples to physicians, as well as prohibits states from licensing distributors of prescription drugs unless the state licensing program meets certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling and record keeping. In addition, the PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations. United States — Anti‑Kickback, False Claims Laws and Other Healthcare Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti‑kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other statutes pertaining to health care fraud and abuse.
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (PPACA) amended the intent element of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to be in violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are 

 
  47

 
drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Violations of the Anti‑Kickback Statute are punishable by penalties including imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, damages, disgorgement and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
 Federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off‑label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, PPACA amended the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal civil False Claims Act. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, which prohibits the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offerer/payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the healthcare fraud provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
 For example, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices undertaken by pharmaceutical companies, including off‑label promotion, may violate false claims laws.
 Pursuant to PPACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued a final rule that requires manufacturers of certain prescription drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The first reports were due in 2014 and must be submitted on an annual basis. The reported data were posted by CMS in searchable form on a public website on September 30, 2014, and will be posted on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.
 In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states. Other states prohibit various other marketing‑related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws may face civil penalties.
 Other federal and state requirements include the following:

· | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the HITECH Act) and its implementing regulations, which imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain people and entities with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  48

 


· | State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

  United States Healthcare Reform
 Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products.
 For example, in March 2010, PPACA was signed into law. PPACA has begun to, and will likely continue to, substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry. The PPACA, among other things: established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; implemented a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Services pharmaceutical pricing program; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute; and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 With the election of President Donald J. Trump in November and his inauguration in January 2017, we expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, including the possible repeal and replacement of PPACA and related legislation, regulations and programs.  Any new state and federal healthcare reform measures could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure. We are unsure of the ways in which PPACA will continue to be challenged, repealed, amended or replaced in the months and years to come.
 Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a 

 
  49

 
favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 To obtain marketing approval of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application (MAA) either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
 Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug. The CHMP is also responsible for several post‑authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
 If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union
 In the European Union, NCEs qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten‑year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization (MA) holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a NCE and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical test, preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product. Data and Market Exclusivity in Japan
 Japan has no established system for data exclusivity or marketing exclusivity. However, the Pharmaceuticals Act of Japan (PAA) provides for a re‑examination system after drug approval. This system imposes an obligation on the MA 

 
  50

 
holder to continue to collect clinical data after market approval during a study period. The MA holder must apply for reexamination to the Minster of Health Labor and Welfare within three months of the expiration of the study period. During the study and reexamination period no generic drug may be approved, effectively providing a form of market exclusivity. The study period is determined by the drug category. The study period for an orphan drug is 10 years from MA, the study period for an NCE is eight years from MA, and for an improvement (new indication, formulation, etc.) the study period is four to six years from MA.
 Patent Term Extension in Japan
 The term of a patent that covers the approved drug may be extended for the shorter of five years, or the period during which the patent could not be worked (exploited) due to obtaining regulatory approval. This period is calculated from the later of the patent registration date (grant date) or the clinical trial start date to the regulatory approval date. Regulatory Exclusivity in China
 China has a six year regulatory exclusivity period for new chemical entities, such as gemcabene, which begins at the date of market approval.
 Foreign Regulation
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third‑party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and adequate reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost‑effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage or adequate reimbursement for the drug product. Third‑party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third‑party payors do not consider our products to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government‑paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and 

 
  51

 
requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
 Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost‑effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross‑border imports from low‑priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third‑party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, the emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third‑party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the PPACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Even if favorable coverage status and adequate reimbursement level status are obtained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
