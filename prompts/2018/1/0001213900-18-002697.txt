ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

 
Our Company develops optical touch and gesture solutions for human interaction with devices. We offer our core technology under the brand name “zForce”.
 
We license our technology to Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) and Tier 1 suppliers who embed our technology into products they develop, manufacture and sell. Since 2010, our licensing customers have sold approximately 56 million devices that use our technology.
 
In addition to our licensing business, we design and manufacture sensor modules that incorporate our zForce AIR technology. We sell our embedded sensors components to OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers for use in their products. We began shipping sensor modules in mid-2017. We sold approximately 1,700 sensor modules in 2017. We also sell our Neonode branded AirBar PC touch product that incorporates one of our sensor modules through distributors and directly to consumers. Since the fourth quarter of 2016, we have sold approximately 17,000 AirBars.
 
Our Organization
 
Neonode Inc., formerly known as SBE, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 4, 1997. SBE’s name was changed to Neonode Inc. upon the completion of a merger on August 10, 2007 between SBE and the parent company of Neonode AB, a company founded in February 2004 and incorporated in Sweden. As a result of the merger, the business and operations of Neonode AB became the primary business and operations of Neonode Inc. Our principal executive office is located in Stockholm, Sweden. Our office in the United States is located in San Jose, California.
 
In 2008, we established a wholly owned subsidiary Neonode Technologies AB (Sweden) to develop and license touchscreen technology. In 2013, we established additional wholly owned subsidiaries: Neonode Japan Inc., (Japan); Neno User Interface Solutions AB (Sweden); NEON Technology Inc. (U.S.); and Neonode Americas Inc. (U.S.). In 2014, we established one additional wholly owned subsidiary: Neonode Korea Ltd. (South Korea). In 2015, we established one additional wholly owned subsidiary: Neonode Taiwan Ltd (Taiwan). In 2015, we established a 51% majority owned consolidated subsidiary: Pronode Technologies AB (Sweden). In 2016, we entered into a joint venture: Neoeye AB (Sweden).

Strategy and Focus Areas
 
Our customers use touch, gesture and object sensing technology to grow their businesses, drive efficiencies, and seek competitive advantages. In this interactive world, cost effective and robust sensing technology is a strategic asset and is increasingly distributed across an expanding number of products. Our strategy is to deliver proven technology and support with the integration so our customers can bring products to market that provide an optimal user experience.
 
In recent years, we added a new business unit to design, manufacture and sell embedded sensors to our business-to-business customers who integrate them into their products. We previously only offered licensed touch technology designs. An important piece of our new strategy has been the development of an automated manufacturing and production system that now is in full operation. Our ability to manufacture fully integrated sensor modules and support with hardware and software integration reduce our customers’ time to market while providing us a path to further growth. 
 
Our goal is to continue to be a leader in touch technology while transitioning current licensing customers into our embedded sensors and expanding to new markets where touch, gesture and object detecting features provide a competitive advantage. We intend to continue innovating through the introduction of next-generation products that offer better price and performance and architectural advantages compared to our competitors. We intend to execute on this strategy through portfolio transformation, internal innovation, and co-development of products with our customers and the building of strategic partnerships.
 
Business Model
 
We derive revenues through technology licensing, selling embedded sensor modules (including the consumer product AirBar) and engineering consulting services. We operate in the business-to-business (“B2B”) and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) markets.
Licensing 
 
As of December 31, 2017, we have entered into forty-one technology license agreements with global OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers. One agreement was terminated in 2017.
 
Our licensing customer base is primarily in the automotive, printer, specialized tablet and e-reader markets. Nineteen of our licensing customers are currently shipping products that embed our touch and gesture technology. We anticipate other customers will initiate product shipments throughout 2018 and in future years as they complete final product development and release cycles. Customer product development and release cycles typically take between 6 months to 36 months. We earn our license fees on a per unit basis when our customers ship products using our technology.

-



We also offer engineering consulting services to our licensing customers on a flat rate or hourly rate basis. Typically, our customers require engineering support during the development and initial manufacturing phase for their products using our technology.
 
Our plan is to continue with the licensing business along with selling embedded sensor modules. For some customers, the licensing business model is preferable while transitioning to purchase agreements using our sensor modules is more attractive to others.
 
Sensor modules 
 
In 2015, we developed our zForce AIR. This optical sensing technology that enables touch interaction, gesture control and object detection led to the development of a series of sensor modules that provide our customers with various solutions in a sensor hardware component.
 
During 2016 and 2017, we invested in developing a new robotic manufacturing process designed specifically for zForce AIR components, including AirBar. Industry specific sensor modules using a common technology platform provides hardware touch, gesture and object sensing solutions along with our technology licensing platform gives us a full range of options to successfully enter and compete in our key markets.
 
In 2016, we developed a consumer product, AirBar. As a plug and play accessory, AirBar enables touch and gesture functionality for notebook computers. AirBar is powered by our sensor modules.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, we began shipping 15.6 inch AirBar to distributors and customers in the United States and Europe. In mid-2017 we started shipping AirBar versions for 13.3 inch and 14 inch Windows-based notebook PCs and an AirBar for the 13.3 inch Apple MacBook Air. We have no current plans to develop new Neonode branded products for the consumer markets.
 
In the second half of 2017, we began selling sensor modules to business customers in the industrial and the consumer electronics market. We expect our sensor modules will continue to gain momentum in the future. Over time, we expect the majority of our revenues will be derived from sensor modules.
 
Markets
 
Automotive
 
The automobile is a key market using interactive and sensing technology to interact with the driver, passengers, its environment and other vehicles. The demand for sensing technology is growing every year as vehicles become more complex and display sizes become larger and curved. Touch and gesture interface and sensing applications are becoming standard equipment in more and more vehicles.
 
The automotive market is comprised of OEM and a series of Tier 1 suppliers who design and manufacture systems and components for the OEMs. We have license agreements with most of the major Tier 1 suppliers who deliver center console infotainment systems to the automotive OEMs. We are also in active design and product development co-operations for our sensor modules with the leading Tier 1 suppliers of automotive entry in addition to our interactive self and assisted driving steering wheel.
 
In 2016, fourteen automotive OEMs had a total of thirty-six automobile models using our touch technology in their infotainment systems. The majority of these automobiles are sold in China and include SUVs (Baojun 560 and Haval H6) and two top-selling sedans (Chevrolet Cruze and Buick Excelle). In the fourth quarter of 2014, Volvo launched their new XC90 incorporating a 9.7 inch display using our touch technology. Our touch technology is also deployed in Volvo models launched in 2016 and 2017, the S90, V90, V90 Cross Country, XC60 and XC40. The Volvo XC90 and S90 infotainment systems have received awards citing properties such as responsiveness and gloved operation. During 2017, our customers shipped approximately 1.1 million products compared to approximately 0.9 million in 2016.

We believe that our new sensor modules are positioned to make further inroads in the global automotive market by offering high performance, easy integration and design freedom.


We are currently actively engaged with automotive OEM and Tier 1 suppliers to the automotive market in the development of the following:
 

● | Our zForce DRIVE sensor technology enables high fidelity detection of hands and fingers positions on the steering wheel. This helps create a safer and more natural interaction with the automobile’s systems and the driver’s smart phone to decrease driver distraction. In 2015, we entered into an agreement with Autoliv Development AB, a leading supplier of safety products for the automotive industry, to explore and industrialize our zForce technology for the steering wheel. Self and assisted driving cars with zForce DRIVE sensors have been publicly displayed at CES 2016, 2017 and 2018. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our zForce AIR sensor modules are being developed for use in entry systems such as tailgates, trunks and other exterior parts of the automobile to enable keyless entry and automation of door functions. 

Consumer Electronics
 
Printers and Office Equipment
 
Photo printers and printers combining printer/scanner/fax functions typically require feature-rich menus and settings to deliver an optimal user experience, and printer OEMs are increasingly replacing mechanical buttons and old style basic resistive touch displays with higher performance touch interactive displays. We have signed license agreements with five of the leading global printers and office equipment OEMs including Hewlett Packard (“HP”), Epson, Canon, Lexmark and Samsung. HP started shipping the first consumer printer with our touch technology integrated in early 2014 and today many of their printer models with interactive displays are using our technology. Samsung and other major customers started shipping printers with our technology in late 2016 and in the first quarter 2017. During 2017 our customers shipped approximately 8 million printers. HP has cumulatively shipped approximately 22 million printers using our touch technology since their first models started shipping in mid-2014.
 
Over the next few years, we expect our printer customers to transition from licensing our touch technology to purchasing and embedding our new sensor modules as new printers are designed and deployed.


E-Readers and Tablets
 
Our touch technology is widely used in e-readers. Since 2011, over 29 million e-readers and tablets have been shipped containing our touch technology by customers such as Amazon, Kobo, Deutsche Telekom, Barnes & Noble and Sony. During 2017, our customers shipped more than 2.7 million e-readers and tablets.


In the second quarter of 2017, we received our first order for sensor modules to be embedded in a larger form factor e-reader/notepad that is expected to begin production mid-2018.


Product Backlog
 
Our sensor module product backlog at March 1, 2018 was approximately $31,000. The product backlog includes orders confirmed for products planned to be shipped within 60 days to one customer. Our AirBar backlog at March 1, 2018 was approximately $112,000. The product backlog includes orders confirmed for products planned to be shipped within 60 days to three customers. Our cycle time between order and shipment is generally short and customers occasionally change delivery schedules. Additionally, orders can be canceled without significant penalties. As a result of these factors, we do not believe that our product backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual product revenue for any future period.
Distribution, Sales and Marketing
 
Licensing
 
In our licensing business, we consider OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers to be our primary customers. OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers determine the design requirements and make the overall decision regarding the use of our user interface and touch technology in their products. The use and pricing of our user interface and touch technology are governed by a technology licensing agreement, which typically have an initial term of three years with automatic one year renewal periods.

Our licensing agreements historically resulted from sales efforts by our senior management, design engineers, and sales personnel interacting with our potential customers’ decision-makers throughout the product development and order process.
 
Sensor modules and Consumer Products


In our sensor module business, we consider OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers to be our primary customers. Our customers purchase sensor modules that come in different sizes with different interfaces and we offer engineering consulting to customize hardware and/or firmware to meet specific requirements. We produce the sensor modules in Sweden by our majority-owned subsidiary Pronode, in an automated manufacturing process. The sales of our sensors are governed by a product purchase agreement. In addition, our customers may request engineering services which will generate NRE fee revenues.


In our consumer products business, we manufacture the sensors for AirBar in Sweden by Pronode and the final assembly, packaging and distribution fulfillment is performed by Salutica. From the Salutica facility, AirBar is shipped to distributors such as Ingram Micro in various global locations. Our sales channel is primarily with key web retailers in each of our global markets such as Amazon.com, Amazon in China, India, Mexico, Canada, Germany and the UK, Best Buy, Newegg and Walmart.
 
Our sales force and marketing operations are managed out of our office in Stockholm, Sweden. Our current sales force is comprised of sales offices located in the United States, Sweden, South Korea, Australia, Japan and Taiwan.
 
Our sales are normally negotiated and executed in U.S. Dollars. 
 
Customers
 
As of December 31, 2017, we have entered into forty-one technology license agreements compared to forty-one and forty license agreements as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. One license agreement was terminated during 2017. Nineteen of our licensing customers are currently shipping products that embed our touch and gesture technology. The products related to these license agreements include e-readers, tablets, commercial and consumer printers, automotive consoles and GPS devices.

Touch Technologies
 
Background
 
There are various technologies for touch and gesture sensing technology available in the market with differing profiles such as performance, power consumption, level of maturity, and cost:

● | Optical sensing technology uses structured light beams that when blocked or reflected by objects enables the detection of the objects position. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Capacitive touch sensors typically use one or several layers of transparent conductive material applied to the inner structure of the LCD or on a glass or plastic layer in front on the LCD to sense activation. 
● | Resistive touch sensors use conductive and resistive layers separated by thin space to sense activation. 
● | Acoustic pulse recognition sensors use piezoelectric transducers located at positions of a surface to alter the mechanical energy of a touch vibration into an electronic signal. 
● | Surface acoustic wave touch sensors use ultrasonic waves that pass over the screen for activation. 

Capacitive and Resistive Technology
 
The two dominant types of touch technologies available are capacitive and resistive. A capacitive sensor reacts to a conductive object by sensing the difference in capacitance between two areas on the sensor surface or between the finger and the ground. Capacitive touch sensors are suitable if the user has unimpeded contact between the finger and the screen. A resistive touch sensor is pressure-sensitive. Resistive touch sensors are suitable for detailed work and for selection of particular spot on a screen. Resistive technology is not suitable for sweeping gestures or motion, such as zooming in and out.
Optical Sensing Technology
 
Our optical technology works by projecting Infrared beams across a surface, through the air or any other detection area without any need for an extra physical layer to be added. It can be activated by using any object such as fingers, passive pens or thick gloves. Our optical sensing technology can also be designed to work through transparent materials, enabling 100% water/dust proof applications and can provide sensing functionality when fully submerged.
 
We believe our optical sensing technology has a number of key advantages over other touch sensing technologies:
 

● | It does not require additional layers that may dilute the image quality of the display or cause unwanted reflections and glare making reading the display difficult. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | It is faster than capacitive sensing technology. 
● | It requires no downward pressure on the activation surface in order to select or move items. 
● | It is cost-efficient due to the lower cost of materials and its high yield manufacturing process. 
● | It enables multiple methods of input, such as continuous tracking of multiple fingers, taps to hit keys, sweeps to zoom in or out, and gestures to write text or symbols directly on the touch surface. 
● | It works in all environments and does not require any special properties from the object used.

Competition
 
The market for touch technology is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving standards and new product releases by our competitors.
 
We believe that implementation of resistive touch technologies in consumer devices is declining because of limitations in sweep gestures, limitations on industrial design, and the negative impact on screen clarity due to film overlays.
 
Neonode is one of few companies that offer optical sensing technology in high volume. Our major competition are companies offering projected capacitive (“PCAP”) technologies. PCAP is a prevalent standard in mobiles and tablets offering finger based touch and industrial design flexibility. PCAP has many suppliers competing to offer the same solution with price being a major differentiation point. OEMs regularly change PCAP suppliers in order to maintain the best pricing.
 
Our competitors, and the interface technology we believe they offer, include the following:
 

Company | Technology 
------------------------+-------------------------------------------------
Synaptics | Capacitive; In-cell 
Cypress | Capacitive; In-cell 
Tyco Electronics | Capacitive; Resistive; Surface acoustic wave 
Touch International | Resistive; Capacitive 

 
We believe that the only current competitor to our AirBar product for PC notebooks is PCAP touch solution embedded during the initial OEM manufacturing process. We do not believe that there are any competitors currently capable of adding plug and play touch screen functions comparable to AirBar for Windows 8 and Windows 10 notebooks.
 
Controller Chips
 
Our licensing customers must use our Application Specific Integrated Circuit (“ASIC”) controllers designed specifically for our optical sensing technology. Our sensor modules also utilize ASIC controller chips.
 
The NN1001, the first-generation controller ASIC, was developed pursuant to an Analog Device Development Agreement between Neonode and Texas Instruments entered into on February 4, 2011 and effective as of January 24, 2010. The NN1001 began shipping to our licensing customers in 2012.


The NN1002, the second-generation controller ASIC, was developed pursuant to an Analog Device Development Agreement between Neonode and Texas Instruments entered into on April 25, 2013 effective December 6, 2012. The NN1002 began shipping to our licensing customers in 2015.
 
The NN1003 is the third-generation controller ASIC and was developed by ST Microelectronics. The NN1003 is designed for high speed sensing applications. The NN1003 began shipping in 2016 and is powering the sensor used in AirBar and our other sensor modules.


The NN1001, NN1002, and NN1003 controllers offer numerous design advantages:
 

● | The NN1001 and NN1002 have scanning speeds of 1000 Hz (latency down to 1ms). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The NN1002 supports advanced power management and enables touch detection even when the device is in sleep or off mode. 
● | The NN1002 consumes less than 1mW at 100Hz. 
● | The NN1002 and NN1003 can be synchronized to touch enable larger areas by using multiple chips. 
● | The NN1002 and NN1003 support simultaneous scanning leading to higher speeds and reduced power consumption. 
● | The NN1001 and NN1002 are AEC-q100 compliant enabling them to safely be utilized in automotive applications.

Australia | | 17 | | 0 
Singapore | | 16 | | 0 
Patent Convention Treaty | | Not Applicable | | 1 
Total: | | 156 | | 28

 
Our patents cover six main categories: user interfaces, optics, controller integrated circuits, drivers, mechanics and applications.


Our user interface software may also be protected by copyright laws in most countries, including Sweden and the European Union, which do not grant patent protection for the software itself, if the software is deemed new and original. Protection can be claimed from the date of creation.
 
In 2017 we filed fourteen new patent applications, while abandoning certain pending patent applications that were no longer in our product plans.
 
The duration of our patent protection for utility patents is generally 20 years. The duration of our patent protection for design patents varies throughout the world between 10 and 25 years, depending on the jurisdiction. We believe the duration of our intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.
  
We also protect and promote our brand by registering trademarks in key markets around the world. These markets include: Neonode (21 registrations), the Neonode logo (13 registrations), zForce (6 registrations), zForce AIR (1 registration), AlwaysON (5 registrations), Multisensing (4 registrations) and AirBar (36 registrations) as well as pending trademark applications for the marks zForce DRIVE, Touch In Everything, and the AirBar logo.
