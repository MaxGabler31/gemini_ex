Item 1. Business
When we use the terms “Bonanza Creek,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” we are referring to Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires. We have included certain technical terms important to an understanding of our business under Glossary of Oil and Natural Gas Terms above. Throughout this document we make statements that may be classified as “forward-looking” Please refer to the Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section above for an explanation of these types of statements.
Overview
Bonanza Creek is a Denver-based exploration and production company focused on the extraction of oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas in the United States. Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on December 2, 2010 and went public in December 2011. 
Our oil and liquids-weighted assets are concentrated primarily in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado. We also own and operate oil-producing assets in the Dorcheat Macedonia Field and the McKamie Patton Field in southern Arkansas and the North Park Basin in Colorado. We operate approximately 92% of all our productive wells allowing us to control the pace, costs and completion techniques used in the development of our asset base. The Wattenberg Field has a low cost structure, strong production efficiencies, established reserves and prospective drilling opportunities, which allows for predictable production and reserve growth.
Bankruptcy Proceedings under Chapter 11
On January 4, 2017, the Company and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. The Debtors received bankruptcy court confirmation of their Plan on April 7, 2017, and emerged from bankruptcy on April 28, 2017 (the “Effective Date”). For additional information about our bankruptcy proceedings and emergence, see Note 2 - Chapter 11 Proceedings and Emergence.
Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company adopted fresh-start accounting and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Upon adoption of fresh-start accounting, our assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair values as of the Effective Date, which differed materially from the recorded values of those same assets and liabilities in the Predecessor Company. As a result, our balance sheets and statement of operations subsequent to the Effective Date are not comparable to our balance sheets and statements of operations prior to the Effective Date. For additional information about our application of fresh-start accounting, see Note 3 - Fresh-Start Accounting.
References to “Successor” or “Successor Company” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to April 28, 2017. References to “Predecessor” or “Predecessor Company” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the Company on or prior to April 28, 2017. References to “Current Successor Period” relates to the period of April 29, 2017 through December 31, 2017. References to “Current Predecessor Period” relate to the period of January 1, 2017 through April 28, 2017. References to “Prior Predecessor Period” relate to the period of January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016.
Our Business Strategies
In 2017, the Company recapitalized its balance sheet, such that it is now well positioned to pursue its development strategy. This strategy consists of utilizing enhanced completion designs to increase the productivity of wells across our acreage position and securing our leasehold position in French Lake, which we expect to delineate in 2018. In order to focus on and partially fund the development of its core assets, the Company elected, subsequent to year-end, to actively pursue the divestment of its Mid-Continent region and North Park Basin assets. The Company successfully sold its North Park Basin on March 9, 2018 for $0.1 million and full release of all current and future obligations.
We also took steps to improve our access to gas processing in the DJ Basin, which will result in improved costs, greater reliability, and greater optionality than available to many other operators in the basin while enhancing the value of our Rocky Mountain Infrastructure, LLC (“RMI”) system. This flexibility helps ensure product flow from both existing and new wells. We will continue to look for ways to improve our access to gas gathering and processing services. 
During 2017, we implemented a series of cost reductions that are anticipated to be fully realized by the beginning of 2019 and result in annualized G&A and LOE reductions of approximately $20.0 million. The cost reductions were focused 
primarily around labor, compression contracts, water services, and well servicing. Further efficiency improvements will continue to be a focus for the Company, with our per-unit costs benefiting from production growth in 2018 and beyond. 
In 2018, the Company plans to accelerate development in the DJ Basin while testing enhanced completion designs on large, efficient multi-well pads throughout the Company’s acreage position. Enhanced completion designs will vary to ensure that thorough knowledge can be applied to future drilling programs. Fluid volumes and types, proppant volumes and types, stage spacing, well spacing, and flowback technique are the primary variables that will be tested throughout the 2018 program. The Company will continue to monitor industry trends, public data, and information from non-operated wells to further delineate optimum completion techniques. The program contemplates running one rig in the first half of 2018 with a second rig added at mid-year to coincide with its access to additional gas processing capacity. The 2018 program is expected to grow Wattenberg annual production by approximately 20% in 2018 and greater than 50% in 2019, assuming a continuous two rig program.
Capital investment with the 2018 program is expected to be approximately $280.0 million to $320.0 million, which will support drilling 90 gross wells and turning online 55 gross wells. 
In order to help achieve the Company's strategies, we are actively seeking to secure permanent leadership.

_____________________

(1) | Proved reserves and related future net revenue and PV-10 were calculated using prices equal to the twelve-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for each of the preceding twelve months, which were $51.34 per Bbl WTI and $2.98 per MMBtu HH. Adjustments were then made for location, grade, transportation, gravity, and Btu content, which resulted in a decrease of $4.58 per Bbl for crude oil and a decrease of $0.53 per MMBtu for natural gas.


(2) | PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquid reserves, less future development and production costs, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash inflows using the twelve-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices, after adjustment for differentials in location and quality, for each of the preceding twelve

11

months. We believe that PV-10 provides useful information to investors as it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors when evaluating oil and gas companies. We believe that PV-10 is relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our reserves. Professional analysts and sophisticated investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies’ reserves. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable in evaluating the Company and our reserves. PV-10 is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated reserves. PV-10 differs from Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (“Standardized Measure”) because it does not include the effect of future income taxes. Please refer to the Reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure presented in the “Reserves” subsection of Item 1 below. 

(3) | Mid-Continent sales volumes were 3,213 Boe/d for 2017, which is comprised of 2,885 Boe/d of production net to our interest and 328 Boe/d sales volumes from our percentage-of-proceeds contracts.

Our Operations
Our operations are mainly focused in the Wattenberg Field in the Rocky Mountain region and in the Dorcheat Macedonia Field in the Mid-Continent region.
Rocky Mountain Region
The two areas in which we operate in the Rocky Mountain region are the Wattenberg Field in Weld County, Colorado and the North Park Basin in Jackson County, Colorado. As of December 31, 2017, our estimated proved reserves in the Rocky Mountain region were 90,478 MBoe, which represented 89% of our total estimated proved reserves and contributed 12,783 Boe/d, or 80%, of sales volumes during 2017.
Wattenberg Field - Weld County, Colorado.  Our operations are located in the oil and liquids-weighted extension area of the Wattenberg Field targeting the Niobrara and Codell formations. As of December 31, 2017, our Wattenberg position consisted of approximately 95,000 gross (67,000 net) acres. 
The Wattenberg Field is now primarily developed for the Niobrara and Codell formations using horizontal drilling and multi-stage fracture stimulation techniques. We believe the Niobrara B and C benches have been fully delineated on our legacy acreage, while the Codell formation has been delineated on our western legacy acreage. Our northern and southern acreage positions are in the early stages of delineation. 
Our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017 in the Wattenberg Field were 90,236 MBoe. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 625 gross producing wells, of which 447 were horizontal wells, and our sales volumes during 2017 were 12,719 Boe/d. Our sales volumes for the fourth quarter of 2017 were 11,916 Boe/d. As of December 31, 2017, our working interest for all producing wells averaged approximately 80% and our net revenue interest was approximately 66%.
We drilled and participated in drilling 59.5 gross (31.8 net) standard reach lateral (“SRL”) equivalent wells in 2017 in the Wattenberg Field. As of December 31, 2017, we have an identified drilling inventory of approximately 205 gross (155.5 net) proved undeveloped (“PUD”) drilling locations (248 gross SRL equivalents) on our acreage. 
During the year, in the Niobrara benches, we drilled eight gross extended reach lateral (“XRL”) operated wells and nine gross SRL operated wells, and we completed four gross XRL operated wells and five gross SRL operated wells. In addition, we drilled and completed one gross Codell SRL operated well. We also participated in the drilling and completion of 15 gross (5.0 net) XRL wells and one gross (0.1 net) medium reach lateral (“MRL”) well in the Niobrara formation. We also participated in the completion of six gross (0.01 net) SRL wells in the Niobrara formation. In addition, we participated in the drilling and completion of one gross (0.5 net) XRL well and the completion of one gross (0.002 net) SRL well in the Codell formation.
The Company entered into two third-party gas processor contracts recently, which reduced line pressures in the Company’s RMI system resulting in improved production from both new and existing wells, and will allow flexibility in moving gas to the most advantageous locations and provide additional production flow assurance.
The Company anticipates running one rig in the first half of 2018 with a second rig added at mid-year. The first rig is planned to drill large scale pads of up to eight wells throughout our legacy acreage position. At least two of the pads drilled in the first half of the year will be completed using slick-water completion designs to further test and validate the improved performance compared to historic gel completion designs. One of these pads is located in the western legacy acreage with the 
12

second pad located in the eastern legacy acreage. Data gathered from these tests will help formulate completion designs in the back half of the year and beyond. The addition of the second rig will provide additional data to form completion techniques and development assumptions throughout the acreage position going forward. The Company will continue to remain agile and modify drilling and completion techniques as additional data from both operated and non-operated wells becomes available.
The 2018 program is expected to grow Wattenberg annual production by approximately 20% in 2018 and greater than 50% in 2019, assuming a continuous two rig program.
Capital investment with this program is expected to be approximately $280.0 million to $320.0 million, which will support drilling 90 gross wells and turning online 55 gross wells in 2018. Of the wells planned to be drilled, approximately 43 are XRL wells, seven are MRL wells, and 40 are SRL wells. The cost of an XRL, MRL, and SRL well is anticipated to be $5.4 million, $4.2 million, and $3.0 million, respectively.
North Park Basin - Jackson County, Colorado. We control approximately 20,000 gross (15,000 net) acres in the North Park Basin in Jackson County, Colorado, all prospective for the Niobrara oil shale. We operate the North and South McCallum Fields, which currently produce light oil, which is trucked to market. 
In the North Park Basin, our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 were approximately 242 MBoe, consisting of 100% crude oil, and our sales volumes during 2017 were 64 Boe/d. Our sales volumes in the North Park Basin for the fourth quarter of 2017 were 57 Boe/d. There were no wells drilled during 2017 in the North Park Basin.
The Company successfully sold its North Park Basin on March 9, 2018 for $0.1 million and full release of all current and future obligations.
Mid-Continent Region
In southern Arkansas, we target the oil-rich Cotton Valley sands in the Dorcheat Macedonia and McKamie Patton Fields. As of December 31, 2017, our estimated proved reserves in the Mid-Continent region were 11,544 MBoe. We currently have 300 gross producing vertical wells. During 2017, no wells were drilled in the Mid-Continent region; however, the Company recompleted 25 wells in the Cotton Valley formation. We achieved a sales volume rate for 2017 of 3,213 Boe/d, of which 70% was from oil and NGLs, and a sales volume rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 of 2,778 Boe/d. None of our 2018 capital budget is assigned to the Mid-Continent region. 
Dorcheat Macedonia. In the Dorcheat Macedonia Field, we average an approximate 87% working interest and an approximate 72% net revenue interest on all producing wells. The majority of our acreage is held by unitization or production. Our production during 2017 was approximately 2,660 Boe/d (2,988 Boe/d sales volumes). During the fourth quarter of 2017, our production was 2,251 Boe/d (2,595 Boe/d sales volumes). Our proved reserves in this field are approximately 10,419 MBoe. Due to the Company having no current plans to drill within the Mid-Continent region, no PUDs have been assigned to this region. 
Other Mid-Continent. We own additional interests in the McKamie Patton Field in the Mid-Continent region near the Dorcheat Macedonia Field. As of December 31, 2017, our estimated proved reserves were approximately 1,125 MBoe, and sales volumes during 2017 were approximately 225 Boe/d. During the fourth quarter of 2017, our production was 183 Boe/d.
Gas Processing Facilities. Our Mid-Continent gas processing facilities are located in Lafayette and Columbia counties in Arkansas and are strategically located to serve our production in the region. Our McKamie Gas Plant has been idle since 2015, and our Dorcheat Macedonia Field Gas Plant has a current capacity of 12.5 MMcf/d with 28,000 gallons per day of associated NGL capacity. Our ownership of these facilities and related gathering pipeline provides us with the benefit of controlling processing and compression of our natural gas production.
Reserves
Estimated Proved Reserves
The summary data with respect to our estimated proved reserves presented below has been prepared in accordance with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities. Our reserve estimates do not include probable or possible reserves. Our estimated proved reserves for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were determined using the preceding twelve month 
13

unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices. For a definition of proved reserves under the SEC rules, please see the Glossary of Oil and Natural Gas Terms included in the beginning of this report.
Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise, and estimates for undeveloped properties are more imprecise than reserve estimates for producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, all of these estimates are expected to change as new information becomes available. The PV-10 values shown in the following table are not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. Neither prices nor costs have been escalated. The actual quantities and present values of our estimated proved reserves may vary from what we have estimated. 
The table below summarizes our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 for each of the regions and currently producing fields in which we operate. The proved reserve estimates as of December 31, 2017 were prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), our third-party independent reserve engineers. The proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are based on reports prepared by our internal corporate reservoir engineering group, of which 100% were audited by NSAI. For more information regarding our independent reserve engineers, please see Independent Reserve Engineers below. The information in the following table is not intended to represent the current market value of our proved reserves nor does it give any effect to or reflect our commodity derivatives or current commodity prices.

(1) | Proved reserves were calculated using the preceding twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices, which were $51.34 per Bbl WTI and $2.98 per MMBtu HH, $42.75 per Bbl WTI and $2.48 per MMBtu HH, and $50.28 per Bbl WTI and $2.59 per MMBtu HH for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Adjustments were made for location and grade.


(2) | Determined using the ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil.

Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. Proved undeveloped reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic productivity at greater distances. 
Proved undeveloped locations in our December 31, 2017 reserve report are included in our development plan and are scheduled to be drilled within five years from their initial proved booking date. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company undertook a process to review its five-year development schedule in light of improved commodity pricing and the significant improvement in the Company's liquidity and outstanding long-term debt and determined that all PUDs would in fact be drilled within the five-year alloted window. The Company’s management evaluated the proved undeveloped drilling plan using NYMEX strip prices, the liquidation model for general and administrative costs and the cash flows from potential asset sales, wells scheduled to be drilled and from existing properties. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company made the election to reset the five-year rule on its existing PUDs. The reserve report factored in a one-rig program until the second half of 2022, when a second-rig is added, which allows all PUDs to be drilled within the allotted five-year window. Subsequent to year-end, the Company approved a second rig to be added at mid-year 2018. All of the PUDs at December 31, 2017 reside in the Wattenberg field. The reliable technologies used to establish our proved reserves are a combination of pressure performance, geologic mapping, offset productivity, electric logs, and production data.
Estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017 were 102.0 MMBoe, a 13% increase from estimated proved reserves of 90.7 MMBoe at December 31, 2016. Approximately 89% of our December 31, 2017 proved reserves are attributed to the Rocky Mountain region, and 99.8% of the Rocky Mountain proved reserves are attributed to the Wattenberg Field. The net increase in our reserves of 11.3 MMBoe is the result of a 15.5 MMBoe increase from PUD and capital additions, coupled with a 7.1 MMBoe increase in net positive cost revisions (reserve prices less drilling and completion costs and LOE), and a 2.1 
15

MMBoe increase due to positive engineering revisions, offset by PUD demotions of 7.6 MMBoe and 2017 production of 5.7 MMBoe. 
Positive adjustments to the estimated proved reserves from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 consisted of pricing and LOE changes, reserve additions from capital and PUD developments, and engineering revisions. The positive pricing revision of 5,405 Mboe resulted from an increase in average commodity price from $42.75 per Bbl WTI and $2.48 per MMBtu HH for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $51.34 per Bbl WTI and $2.98 per MMBtu HH for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 1,672 MBoe LOE revision is due to continued decreased LOE as a result of numerous cost-cutting initiatives completed over the past few years. The 15,547 Mboe in PUD and capital additions is the result of completing 10 operated and 24 non-operated unproved horizontal locations in the Niobrara and Codell formations in the Wattenberg Field during 2017 and adding infill PUD locations that are on the 2018 rig schedule, offset by PUD locations that were removed due to a shift within our development strategy. 
As of December 31, 2017, the current total proved undeveloped location count in our Wattenberg Field was 205 (248 SRL equivalents), compared to 210 (226 SRL equivalents) as of December 31, 2016. Our five-year plan includes the drilling of these proved undeveloped locations. The year-end 2017 reserves were based on a one-rig drilling program estimated to convert 19% of our year-end 2017 proved undeveloped reserves in the Wattenberg Field. Subsequent to year-end, the Company approved a second rig to be added at mid-year 2018. New drilling in 2018 will begin around existing central production facilities (“CPFs”) as they can be connected immediately upon completion. For the year ending December 31, 2017, approximately 50% of the proved undeveloped locations are spaced on 80 acres within a single bench and approximately 50% are planned to be drilled on 80/40 geometry, which involves drilling wells on 80 acre spacing on each of two benches with a 40 acre offset between wells on the upper and lower bench.
Estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were 90.7 MMBoe, a 10% decrease from estimated proved reserves of 101.3 MMBoe at December 31, 2015. The net decrease in our reserves of 10.6 MMBoe is the result of 2016 production of 7.8 MMBoe coupled with writing off 16.4 MMBoe of PUDs and 1.9 MMBoe of other engineering revisions, offset by additions in extensions, discoveries, and infills of 10.8 MMBoe and net positive cost revisions (reserve prices less drilling and completion costs and LOE) of 4.7 MMBoe. 
The 10.8 MMBoe addition in extensions, discoveries, and infills in 2016 was primarily the result of completing five operated and six non-operated unproved horizontal locations in the Niobrara formation that were in progress at year-end 2015, and drilling and completing three non-operated unproved horizontal wells and one operated unproved vertical well in the Niobrara formation in the Wattenberg Field during 2016. In 2016 our five-year drilling plan was adjusted to focus on locations that were adjacent to existing production facilities. As a result, 42 PUD locations were added and 38 PUD locations under the prior plan were removed
Total Company positive engineering revisions as of December 31, 2016, were 28,625 Mboe, of which 32,899 Mboe were related to positive reserve changes in the Wattenberg Field and 4,416 Mboe were related to negative reserve changes in the Dorcheat Macedonia Field. The overall positive engineering revision is offset by a negative pricing revision of 39,222 Mboe in the Wattenberg Field and 2,778 Mboe in the Dorcheat Macedonia Field. The negative pricing revision of 42,143 Mboe for the Company resulted from a decrease in average commodity price from $50.28 per Bbl WTI and $2.59 per MMBtu HH for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $42.75 per Bbl WTI and $2.48 per MMBtu HH for the year ended December 31, 2016. The majority of the positive revisions in the Wattenberg Field resulted from a combination of decreased drilling and completion costs and a continued decrease in LOE, which had begun in 2015. Our total proved undeveloped location count in the Wattenberg Field as of December 31, 2016 was 210 (226 standard reach lateral equivalents) and was 204 as of December 31, 2015. 
Total Company positive engineering revisions as of December 31, 2015, were 37,174 Mboe, of which 30,086 Mboe (81%) related to reserve changes in the Wattenberg Field. This positive engineering revision was offset by a negative pricing revision of 21,417 Mboe in the Wattenberg Field. The majority of the positive revisions in the Wattenberg Field resulted from a combination of decreased drilling and completion costs, including $3.0 million per standard reach lateral well as of December 31, 2015 compared to $4.2 million at December 31, 2014, a 29% decrease, and an increase in productivity from horizontal proved developed producing wells, which increased the offsetting proved undeveloped reserves. The increase in PDP reserves was primarily attributed to the installation of infrastructure in the east side of our Wattenberg Field acreage, which removed the producing constraint that inhibited productivity over the prior two years of development in that area. Another significant contribution to the positive reserve revision in the Wattenberg Field results from a contract change as of January 1, 2015, which gave our Company ownership of the natural gas liquids from our gas production. This conversion from two-stream (wet gas and oil) to three-stream (dry gas, natural gas liquids and oil) added 8,560 Mboe to our proved reserves as of December 31, 2015. With the addition of 45 horizontal proved undeveloped locations in the Wattenberg Field to the proved reserves at 
16

December 31, 2015, the total proved undeveloped location count as of December 31, 2015 was 204 (220 standard reach lateral equivalents) and was 226 as of December 31, 2014. A negative pricing revision of 28,810 Mboe for the Company resulted from a decrease in average commodity price from $94.99 per Bbl WTI and $4.35 per MMBtu HH for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $50.28 per Bbl WTI and $2.59 per MMBtu HH for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure
PV-10 is derived from the Standardized Measure, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV-10 is a computation of the Standardized Measure on a pre-tax basis. PV-10 is equal to the Standardized Measure at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10%. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties. PV-10, however, is not a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Neither our PV-10 measure or the Standardized Measure purport to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves.
The following table provides a reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:

 | December 31, 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015

Standardized Measure | $ | 598.5 | | $ | 276.9 | $ | 327.8

____________________________
(1) The tax basis of our oil and gas properties as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 provides more tax deduction than income generated from our oil and gas properties when the reserve estimates were prepared using $51.34 per Bbl WTI and $2.98 per MMBTU HH, $42.75 per Bbl WTI and $2.48 per MMBtu HH, and $50.28 per Bbl WTI and $2.59 per MMBtu HH, respectively.

At December 31, 2017, our proved undeveloped reserves were 48,082 MBoe, all of which are scheduled to be drilled within five years of their initial proved booking date. During 2017, the Company converted 6% of its proved undeveloped reserves (seven gross wells representing net reserves of 2,196 MBoe) at a cost of $26.1 million. The net increase of 4,140 Mboe in PUD additions are the result of adding infill PUD locations that are on the 2018 rig schedule, offset by PUD locations that were removed due to a changes in our development strategy. The increase in revisions is primarily due to the forecasted production uplift resulting from enhanced completion designs. 
At December 31, 2016, our proved undeveloped reserves were 40,057 MBoe, all of which were scheduled to be drilled within five years of their initial proved booking date. During 2016, the Company converted 3% of its proved undeveloped 
17

reserves (seven gross wells representing net reserves of 1,352 MBoe) at a cost of $16.2 million. Our 2016 capital program was suspended after the first quarter, and no proved undeveloped locations were added as a result of drilling. The net decrease in our PUD reserves from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 was mainly the result of removing 7.8 MMBoe of PUDs in the Mid-Continent region, as drilling is now focused entirely on the Wattenberg Field. Thirty-eight Wattenberg proved undeveloped locations that were not within areas with existing CPFs were demoted and were replaced with 42 infill proved undeveloped locations that are near existing CPFs which contributes to development well planning. 
At December 31, 2015, our proved undeveloped reserves were 49,184 MBoe, all of which were scheduled to be drilled within five years of their initial proved booking date. During 2015, the Company converted 16% of its proved undeveloped reserves (52 gross wells representing net reserves of 6,994 MBoe) at a cost of $121.0 million. Executing our 2015 capital program resulted in the addition of 2,308 MBoe (17 gross wells) in proved undeveloped reserves in the Wattenberg Field. A small acquisition within the field limits of the Dorcheat Macedonia Field added 14 gross proved undeveloped locations and 1,541 MBoe to our reserves. The positive engineering revision of 9,083 MBoe reflected in the December 31, 2015 reserve estimates was primarily the result of adding 28 gross new proved undeveloped locations in the Wattenberg Field on 80-acre spacing, the majority directly offsetting economic proved producing wells drilled prior to 2015, and an increase in proved undeveloped reserves in the eastern portion of the Wattenberg Field resulting from increased productivity due to the procurement and installation of third party infrastructure, which eliminated a production constraint thereby allowing productivity to rise, proved developed reserves to increase, and associated proved undeveloped reserves to increase by an estimated 3.0 MMBoe.
Internal controls over reserves estimation process
Our policies regarding internal controls over the recording of reserves estimates require reserves to be in compliance with SEC definitions and guidance and prepared in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The Company’s Reserves Committee reviews significant reserve changes on an annual basis and our third-party independent reserve engineers, NSAI, is engaged by and has direct access to the Reserves Committee. The reserves estimates for the year ended December 31, 2017 shown herein have been independently prepared by NSAI. These NSAI reserve estimates are reviewed by our in-house petroleum engineer who oversees and controls preparation of the reserve report data by working with NSAI to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to NSAI for their evaluation process. The Company's technical person who was primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates was our Senior Reservoir Development Engineer who has over 17 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, including three years in her role at the Company. Her professional qualifications include a bachelor's degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Wyoming and a master's degree in Petroleum Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines. 
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company prepared the reserves estimates, which were 100% audited by NSAI. The responsibility for compliance in reserves estimation was delegated to our internal corporate reservoir engineering group managed by John E. Vorwerk. Mr. Vorwerk was our Corporate Reserves Manager until August 2017. Mr. Vorwerk attended the Colorado School of Mines and graduated in 1976 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Geological Engineering. He also received a Master of Science degree in Mineral Economics from the Colorado School of Mines in 1991. Mr. Vorwerk had been in the petroleum industry for 41 years, and had been a Registered Professional Engineer since 1981. He had been directly involved in evaluations and the estimation of reserves and resources, and has worked in the corporate reserves function for over 21 years. Mr. Vorwerk was employed at Bonanza from 2014 until 2018, and served as Corporate Reserves Manager. During this time our internal corporate reservoir engineering group was responsible for compliance in reserve estimation, and our internal corporate reservoir engineering gropu, collectively with Mr. Vorwerk, had over 85 years of industry experience.
Independent Reserve Engineers
The reserves estimates for the year ended December 31, 2017 shown herein have been independently prepared by NSAI. The reserve estimates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were independently audited by NSAI, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-2699. Within NSAI, the technical persons primarily responsible for preparing the estimates set forth in the NSAI reserves report incorporated herein are Mr. Benjamin W. Johnson and Mr. John Hattner. Mr. Johnson, a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (No. 124738), has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 2007 and has over 2 years of prior industry experience. He graduated from Texas Tech University in 2005 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Petroleum Engineering. Mr. Hattner, a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas, Geology (No. 559), has been practicing consulting petroleum geoscience at NSAI since 1991, and has over 11 years of prior industry 
18

experience. He graduated from University of Miami, Florida, in 1976 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Geology; from Florida State University in 1980 with a Master of Science Degree in Geological Oceanography; and from Saint Mary's College of California in 1989 with a Master of Business Administration Degree. Both technical principals meet or exceed the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; both are proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines.
Production, Revenues and Price History
Oil and gas prices have shown signs of rebounding during the latter part of 2017 and continuing into 2018. Oil prices are impacted by production levels, crude oil inventories, real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil producing regions, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, weather and the global economy. With better pricing, we expect increased industry activity, which could moderate the magnitude of price increases throughout the year.
Sensitivity Analysis
If oil and natural gas SEC prices declined by 10%, our proved reserve volumes would decrease by 2% and our PV-10 value as of December 31, 2017 would decrease by approximately 28% or $169.0 million. The PV-10 value of our Rocky Mountain region, primarily our Wattenberg assets, would decrease by 31% or $148.3 million. If oil and natural gas SEC prices increased by 10%, our proved reserve volumes would increase by 1% and our PV-10 value as of December 31, 2017 would increase by approximately 27% or $161.7 million. The PV-10 value of our Rocky Mountain region, primarily our Wattenberg assets, would increase by 29% or $140.5 million.
The Company did not incur any impairments during 2017, and we do not anticipate triggering any impairments in 2018 when analyzing price changes only. 
Production
The following table sets forth information regarding oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production, sales prices, and production costs for the periods indicated.

Principal Customers
Three of our customers, NGL Crude Logistics, LLC, Lion Oil Trading & Transportation, Inc., and Duke Energy Field Services, comprised 44%, 18%, and 16%, respectively, of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. No other single non-affiliated customer accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas sales in 2017. We believe the loss of any 
20

one customer would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations because there are numerous potential customers for our production.
Delivery Commitments
The Company entered into a new purchase agreement upon emergence from bankruptcy. The terms of the agreement consists of defined volume commitments over an initial seven-year term. The Company will be required to make periodic deficiency payments for any shortfalls in delivering minimum volume commitments, which are set in six-month periods beginning in January 2018. The Company's capital program is designed to exceed these minimum volume commitments. During 2018, the average minimum volume commitment will be approximately 10,100 barrels per day and increases by approximately 41% from 2018 to 2019 and approximately 3% each year thereafter for the remainder of the contract, to a maximum of approximately 16,000 barrels per day. The aggregate financial commitment fee over the seven-year term, based on the minimum volume commitment schedule (as defined in the agreement) and the applicable differential fee, is $154.5 million as of December 31, 2017. Please refer to Note 8 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion.

Undeveloped acreage
We critically review and consider at-risk leasehold with attention to our ability either to convert term leasehold to held-by-production status or obtain term extensions. We focus primarily on the core fields of development where reserve bookings are prevalent. Decisions to let leasehold expire generally relate to areas outside of our core fields of development or when the expirations do not pose material impacts to development plans or reserves.

Capital Expenditure Budget
The Company contemplates running one rig in the first half of 2018 with a second rig added at mid-year. The capital budget for 2018 is expected to be approximately $280.0 million to $320.0 million, which will support drilling 90 gross wells and turning online 55 gross wells in 2018 all within the Rocky Mountain region. Of the wells planned to be drilled, approximately 43 are XRL wells, seven are MRL wells, and 40 are SRL wells. The costs of XRL, MRL, and SRL wells are anticipated to be $5.4 million, $4.2 million, and $3.0 million, respectively. Actual capital expenditures could vary significantly 
22

based on, among other things, market conditions, commodity prices, drilling and completion costs, well results, and changes in the borrowing base under our successor credit facility.
Derivative Activity 
In addition to supply and demand, oil and gas prices are affected by seasonal, economic and geo-political factors that we can neither control or predict. We attempt to mitigate a portion of our exposure to potentially adverse market changes in commodity prices and the associated impact on cash flows through the use of derivative contracts. We have successfully hedged approximately 31% of our projected 2018 production.

Title to Properties
Our properties are subject to customary royalty interests, overriding royalty interests, obligations incident to operating agreements, liens for current taxes, other industry‑related constraints, and certain other leasehold restrictions. We do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with our use of the properties in the operation of our business. We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties. We undergo a thorough title review process upon receipt of title opinions received from outside legal counsel before we commence drilling operations. Although title to our properties is subject to complex interpretation of multiple conveyances, deeds, reservations, and other instruments that serve to affect mineral title, we believe that none of these risks will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or otherwise materially interfere with the operation of our business.
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive, and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that often have greater resources. Many of these companies explore for, produce, and market oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations, and market the resultant products on a worldwide basis. The primary areas in which we encounter substantial competition are in locating and acquiring desirable leasehold acreage for our drilling and development operations, locating and acquiring attractive producing oil and gas properties, attracting and retaining qualified personnel, and obtaining transportation for the oil and gas we produce in certain regions. There is also competition between producers of oil and gas and other industries producing alternative energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by federal, state, and local governments; however, it is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation that may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may, however, substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing, or producing gas and oil and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. The effect and potential impacts of these risks are difficult to accurately predict.
24

Further, oil prices and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other. Because approximately 74% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 were oil and natural gas liquids reserves, our financial results are more sensitive to movements in oil prices. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the daily NYMEX WTI oil spot price ranged from a high of $60.46 per Bbl to a low of $42.48 per Bbl, and the NYMEX natural gas HH spot price ranged from a high of $3.71 per MMBtu to a low of $2.44 per MMBtu. 
Insurance Matters
As is common in the oil and gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or customary, or because premium costs are considered cost prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state, and local laws and regulations. In particular, oil and natural gas production and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes, and numerous other laws and regulations. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate properties or assets for oil and natural gas production have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including, among other things, provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area, and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas wells, and regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and that impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells.
Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations. The regulatory burden on the industry can increase the cost of doing business and negatively affect profitability. Because such laws and regulations are frequently revised and amended through various legislative actions and rulemakings, it is difficult to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional rulemakings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered at the federal, state and various local government levels, including statutorily and through powers granted to various agencies that regulate our industry, and various court actions. We cannot predict when or whether any such rulemakings may become effective and if the outcomes will negatively affect our operations.
We believe that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen incidents may occur or past noncompliance with laws or regulations may be discovered.
Regulation of transportation of oil
Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. Interstate transportation of oil by pipeline is regulated by FERC pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and its implementing regulations require that tariff rates for interstate service on oil pipelines, including interstate pipelines that transport crude oil and refined products (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”) be just and reasonable and non‑discriminatory and that such rates and terms and conditions of service be filed with FERC.
Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated.
Regulation of transportation and sales of natural gas
Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government, primarily FERC. FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
25

In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”) and culminated in adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce is regulated primarily under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by Congress and by FERC regulations.
FERC issued a series of orders in 1996 and 1997 to implement its open access policies. As a result, the interstate pipelines’ traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas has been greatly reduced and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage service on an open access basis to others who buy and sell natural gas. Although FERC’s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.
The Domenici Barton Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EP Act of 2005”), is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans, and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. Among other matters, the EP Act of 2005 amends the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC. The EP Act of 2005 provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per day for violations of the NGA and increases FERC’s civil penalty authority under the NGPA from $5,000 per violation per day to $1,000,000 per violation per day. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti-market manipulation provision of the EP Act of 2005, and subsequently denied rehearing. The rules make it unlawful: (1) in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation more accessible to natural gas services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti-market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which now includes the annual reporting requirements under Order 704. The anti-market manipulation rule and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of FERC’s NGA enforcement authority.
Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our costs of getting gas to point of sale locations. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory-take requirements. Although nondiscriminatory-take regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress.
Our sales of natural gas are also subject to requirements under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). The CEA prohibits any person from manipulating or attempting to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce or futures on such commodity. The CEA also prohibits knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of a commodity.
Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect 
26

our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete.
Regulation of production
The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require, among other things, permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the spacing and unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the regulation of well spacing and well density, and procedures for proper plugging and abandonment of wells. The intent of these regulations is to promote the efficient recovery of oil and gas reserves while reducing waste and protecting correlative rights. By collaborating with industry’s exploration and development operations, these regulations effectively identify where wells can be drilled, well densities by geologic formation, and the appropriate spacing and pooling unit size to effectively drain the resources. Operators can apply for exceptions to such regulations including applications to increase well densities to more effectively recover the oil and gas resources. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
We own interests in properties located onshore in three U.S. states. These states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters, including the handling and disposal of waste materials, the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled, and the unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties. 
Regulation of derivatives 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was passed by Congress and signed into law in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for the regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market with the intent to provide greater transparency and reduction of risk between counterparties. The Dodd-Frank Act subjects swap dealers and major swap participants to capital and margin requirements and requires many derivative transactions to be cleared on exchanges. The Dodd-Frank Act provides for a potential exemption from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation
Our natural gas and oil exploration and production operations are subject to numerous stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing safety and health, the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or natural resources, noncompliance with which can result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and other sanctions, including suspension or cessation of operations. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits before drilling or other regulated activity commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment; govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process; limit or prohibit drilling activities that impact threatened or endangered species or that occur in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier and other protected areas; require some form of investigation or remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits; establish specific safety and health criteria addressing worker and natural resource protection and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with regulatory filing obligations. Cumulatively, these laws and regulations may impact the rate of production.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
27

Hazardous substances and waste handling
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these potentially “responsible persons” may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We are able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which we act as operator. Notwithstanding our lack of direct control over wells operated by others, the failure of an operator other than us to comply with applicable environmental regulations may, in certain circumstances, be attributed to us. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as or contain CERCLA hazardous substances but we are not aware of any liabilities for which we may be held responsible that would materially or adversely affect us. 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous wastes, and distinguishes between hazardous and non-hazardous or solid wastes. With the approval of the EPA, the individual states can administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, and some states have adopted their own, more stringent hazardous waste requirements, while all states regulate solid waste. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of natural gas and oil are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions and state solid waste laws. However, legislation has been proposed from time to time and various environmental groups have filed lawsuits that, if successful, could result in the reclassification of certain natural gas and oil exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make such wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. For example, in May 2016, several environmental groups filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that seeks to compel the EPA to review and, if necessary, revise its regulations regarding existing exemptions for exploration and production related wastes. On December 28, 2016, the EPA entered into a consent decree with those environmental groups to settle the lawsuit, which requires the EPA by March 15, 2019 to either propose new regulations regarding exploration and production related wastes or sign a determination that revision of such regulations is not necessary.
We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used for numerous years to explore and produce oil and natural gas. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, exploration and production fluids and gases may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons and wastes were not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including groundwater contaminated by prior owners or operators), to pay for damages for the loss or impairment of natural resources, and to take measures to prevent future contamination from our operations.
In addition, other laws require the reporting on use of hazardous and toxic chemicals. For example, in October 2015, EPA granted, in part, a petition filed by several national environmental advocacy groups to add the oil and gas extraction industry to the list of industries required to report releases of certain “toxic chemicals” under the Toxic Release Inventory (“TRI”) program under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. EPA determined that natural gas processing facilities may be appropriate for addition to TRI applicable facilities and in January 2017, EPA issued a proposed rule to include natural gas processing facilities in the TRI program. EPA review of comments on this proposed rule is ongoing.
Pipeline safety and maintenance
Pipelines, gathering systems and terminal operations are subject to increasingly strict safety laws and regulations. Both the transportation and storage of refined products and crude oil involve a risk that hazardous liquids may be released into the environment, potentially causing harm to the public or the environment. In turn, such incidents may result in substantial expenditures for response actions, significant penalties, liability for natural resources damages, and significant business interruption. The U.S. Department of Transportation has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of our pipeline and storage facilities. These regulations contain requirements for the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the 
28

inspection and testing of pipelines and the correction of anomalies. These regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans.
There have been recent initiatives to strengthen and expand pipeline safety regulations and to increase penalties for violations. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act was signed into law in early 2012. In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) has issued new rules to strengthen federal pipeline safety enforcement programs. In 2015, PHMSA proposed to expand its regulations in a number of ways, including through the increased regulation of gathering lines, even in rural areas. In 2016, PHMSA increased its regulations to require crude oil sampling and reporting as an offeror and increased its civil penalty structure.
Air emissions
The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including oil and gas operations, and impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Obtaining required air permits can significantly delay the development of certain oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues.
For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules under the CAA that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) programs. With regards to production activities, these final rules require, among other things, the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from three subcategories of fractured and refractured gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted: wildcat (exploratory) and delineation gas wells; low reservoir pressure non-wildcat and non-delineation gas wells; and all “other” fractured and refractured gas wells. These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors and from certain pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. The EPA issued revised rules in 2013 and 2014 in response to requests for reconsideration of portions the 2012 NSPS and NESHAP rules from industry and the environmental community. As part of that reconsideration, in May 2016, the EPA issued revisions to the NSPS rules focused on achieving additional methane and volatile organic compound reductions from oil and natural gas operations. Among other things, these revisions impose new requirements for leak detection and repair, control requirements for oil well completions, and additional control requirements for gathering, boosting, and compressor stations. On May 26, 2017, the EPA announced a 90-day stay of certain portions of the NSPS standards, which stay was vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on July 3, 2017. The EPA also proposed a two-year stay of the certain portions of the NSPS standards on June 12, 2017. In furtherance of this proposed stay, EPA released two notices of data availability that request information from industry in order to support the 2-year stay of certain requirements.
In February 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s Air Quality Control Commission (AQCC) adopted new and revised air quality regulations that impose stringent new requirements to control emissions from both existing and new or modified oil and gas facilities in Colorado. The regulations include new emissions control, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements on oil and gas operators in Colorado. For example, the regulations impose Storage Tank Emission Management (STEM) requirements for certain new and existing storage tanks. The STEM requirements require us to install costly emission control technologies as well as monitoring and recordkeeping programs at most of our new and existing well production facilities. The new Colorado regulations also impose a Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) program for well production facilities and compressor stations. The LDAR program primarily targets hydrocarbon (i.e., methane) emissions from the oil and gas sector in Colorado and represents a significant new use of state authority regarding these emissions. 
On October 1, 2015, EPA finalized its rule lowering the existing 75 part per billion (“ppb”) national ambient air quality standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone under the CAA to 70 ppb. Also in 2015, the State of Colorado received a bump-up in its existing ozone standard non-attainment status from “marginal” to “moderate.” Oil and natural gas operations in ozone nonattainment areas, including in the DM/NFR area, may be subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs. The DM/NFR area is at risk of being reclassified to “serious” non-attainment if it does not meet the 2008 NAAQS by 2018 or obtain an extension of the deadline from EPA. A “serious” classification would trigger significant additional obligations for the state under the CAA and could result in new and more stringent air quality control requirements applicable to our operations and significant costs and delays in obtaining necessary permits for new and significantly modified production facilities. A recent decision by the U.S. 
29

Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit also raises the possibility that both the 2008 and 2015 ozone NAAQS will remain in effect for a period of years, further complicating our future compliance and operations in ozone non-attainment areas. 
In May 2016, the EPA also finalized a rule regarding source determination, including defining the term “adjacent” under the CAA, which affects how major sources, are defined, particularly regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major sources, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements. These EPA rulemakings will have nominal effect on our operations because the rule clarified our existing presumption on “adjacent” and presents no conflict with the state of Colorado or Arkansas definitions. 
The EPA also published Control Technique Guidelines (“CTGs”) in October 2016 aimed at providing states with guidance and setting a presumptive floor for Reasonably Achievable Control Technology (“RACT”) for the oil and gas industry in areas of ozone non-attainment, including the Denver Metro/North Front Range 8-hour Ozone Non-Attainment area (“DM/NFR area”). In November 2017, as required following issuance of the CTGs, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission (AQCC) adopted additional RACT and other air quality regulations that increased emissions control, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements on oil and gas operators in the DM/NFR area, and to some extent state-wide.
Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could be significant.
Climate change
Based on EPA findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA adopted regulations under the CAA that, among other things, established PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already major sources of emissions of regulated pollutants. In a subsequent ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a portion of EPA’s GHG stationary source program, but also invalidated a portion of it, holding that stationary sources already subject to the PSD or Title V program for non-GHG criteria pollutants remained subject to GHG BACT requirements, but that sources subject to the PSD or Title V program only for GHGs could not be forced to comply with EPA’s GHG BACT requirements. Upon remand, the D.C. Circuit issued an amended judgment, which, among other things, vacated the PSD and Title V regulations under review in that case to the extent they require a stationary source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit solely because the source emits or has the potential to emit GHGs above the applicable major source thresholds. In October 2016, EPA issued a proposed rule to further revise its PSD and Title V regulations applicable to GHGs in accordance with these court rulings, including a proposed de minimis level of GHG emissions below which BACT is not required. Depending an EPA’s final rule, it is possible that any regulatory or permitting obligation that limits emissions of GHGs could extend to smaller stationary sources and require us to incur costs to reduce and monitor emissions of GHGs associated with our operations, and may also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.
In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. We are monitoring GHG emissions from our operations in accordance with the GHG emissions reporting rule.
In August of 2015, the EPA finalized rules to further reduce GHG emissions, primarily from coal-fired power plants, under its Clean Power Plan (“CPP”). On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing the EPA to review the CPP regulations. Following the Executive Order, on April 4, 2017, the EPA announced that it was formally reviewing the CPP. On October 9, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to repeal the Clean Power Plan. The comment period on the proposed rule is open until April 26, 2018. Following the comment period, EPA is expected to release a final rule.
Congress has, from time to time, considered but not yet passed legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. In addition, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. 
Additional GHG regulation may also result from the December 2015 agreement that the United States reached during the December 2015 United Nations climate change conference in Paris, France (the Paris Agreement). Within the Paris Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce its GHG emissions by 26-28% by the year 2025 as compared with 2005 levels, and provide periodic updates on its progress. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Although President Trump has the authority to unilaterally withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, per the terms of the Agreement, such a withdrawal may not be made until three years from the 
30

effective date of the Agreement, which is November 4, 2019, and any such withdrawal only becomes effective one year after the notice of withdrawal is provided.
Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. Severe limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.
Water discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act or the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into certain surface waters of the U.S., including spills and leaks of hydrocarbons and produced water. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on‑site storage of significant quantities of oil. As properties are acquired, we determine the need for new or updated SPCC plans and, where necessary, will develop or update such plans to implement physical and operation controls, the costs of which are not expected to be material. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers adopted a new regulatory definition of “waters of the U.S.,” (“WOTUS”) which governs which waters and wetlands are subject to the CWA. The scope of what areas constitute jurisdictional waters of the United States regulated under the CWA is currently the subject of ongoing litigation and related administrative proceedings that are not expected to be resolved for several years. Additionally, in June 2016, EPA finalized new CWA pretreatment standards that would prevent onshore unconventional oil and natural gas wells from discharging wastewater pollutants to publicly-owned treatment facilities. Regulated entities are required to come into compliance with these pretreatment standards by August 29, 2019.
Endangered Species Act
The federal Endangered Species Act restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. A final rule amending how critical habitat is designated was finalized in 2016. Some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.
Employee health and safety
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. In 2016, there were substantial revisions to the regulations under OSHA that may have impact to our operations. These changes include among other items; record keeping and reporting, revised crystalline silica standard, naming oil and gas as a high hazard industry and requirements for a safety and health management system. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations, and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Hydraulic fracturing
Regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing. We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning health, safety, and environmental protection. Government authorities frequently add to those requirements, and both oil and gas development generally and hydraulic fracturing specifically are receiving increasing regulatory attention. Our operations utilize hydraulic fracturing, an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and natural gas wells in low-permeability formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, proppant, and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate hydrocarbon production.
States have historically regulated oil and gas exploration and production activity, including hydraulic fracturing. State governments in the areas where we operate have adopted or are considering adopting additional requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing that could restrict its use in certain circumstances or make it more costly to utilize. Such measures may address any risk to drinking water, the potential for hydrocarbon migration and disclosure of the chemicals used in fracturing.

Colorado, for example, comprehensively updated its oil and gas regulations in 2008 and adopted significant additional amendments in 2011 and 2013. Among other things, the updated and amended regulations require operators to reduce methane emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing, compile and report additional information regarding wellbore integrity, publicly disclose the chemical ingredients used in hydraulic fracturing, increase the minimum distance between occupied structures and oil and gas wells, undertake additional mitigation for nearby residents, and implement additional groundwater testing. In 2014, Colorado enacted legislation to increase the potential sanctions for statutory, regulatory and other violations. Among other things, this legislation and its implementing regulations mandate monetary penalties for certain types of violations, require a penalty to be assessed for each day of violation and significantly increase the maximum daily penalty amount. In early 2016, Colorado adopted rules imposing additional permitting requirements for certain large scale facilities in urban mitigation areas and additional notice requirements prior to engaging in operations near certain municipalities. Any enforcement actions or requirements of additional studies or investigations by governmental authorities where we operate could increase our operating costs and cause delays or interruptions of our operations.
The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and comparable state statutes may restrict the disposal, treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development. Subsurface emplacement of fluids, primarily via disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery (“EOR”) wells, is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that, in some cases, include the state oil and gas regulatory or the state’s environmental authority. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Underground Injection Control provisions of the SDWA to expressly exclude certain hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection,” but disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids and produced water or their injection for EOR is not excluded. 
Federal agencies are also considering additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has published guidance for issuing underground injection permits that would regulate hydraulic fracturing using diesel fuel. This guidance eventually could encourage other regulatory authorities to adopt permitting and other restrictions on the use of hydraulic fracturing. In addition, on October 21, 2011, the EPA announced its intention to propose regulations under the CWA to regulate wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas production. As noted above, in June 2016, EPA finalized regulations that address discharges of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works. Regulated entities are required to come into compliance with these standards by August 29, 2019. The EPA also published a study of the impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in December 2016, which concluded that drinking water resources can be affected by hydraulic fracturing under specific circumstances. The results of this study could result in additional regulations, which could lead to operational burdens similar to those described above. The EPA also has initiated a stakeholder and potential rulemaking process under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) to obtain data on chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has not indicated when it intends to issue a proposed rule, but it issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May 2014, seeking public comment on a variety of issues related to the potential TSCA rulemaking. As also noted above, in January 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rule to include natural gas processing facilities in the TRI program. The United States Department of the Interior also finalized a new rule regulating hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water; however, on December 29, 2017, the BLM issued a rescission of the hydraulic fracturing rule. This rescission and the rule as promulgated are subject to ongoing litigation. Additionally, in early 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) proposed rules related to further controlling the venting and flaring of natural gas on BLM land. The Department of the Interior (the parent department of BLM) announced in October 2017 that it would delay the effective dates of the BLM venting and flaring rules that were to become effective in January 2018. Recently, a Federal district court in Northern California granted a preliminary injunction to prevent BLM’s stay of those effective dates. The rule is currently in effect, but is also subject to ongoing litigation and rulemaking, which could result in a rescission or substantial rewrite.
Apart from these ongoing federal and state initiatives, local governments are adopting new requirements on hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas operations. Voters in Colorado have proposed or advanced initiatives restricting or banning oil and gas development in Colorado. Any successful bans or moratoriums where we operate could increase the costs of our operations, impact our profitability, and even prevent us from drilling in certain locations.
At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of recent state and local actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations affecting hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of future federal, state or local laws or implementing regulations imposing new environmental obligations on, or otherwise limiting, our operations could make it more difficult and more expensive to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase our costs of compliance and doing business, delay or prevent the development of certain resources (including especially shale formations that are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing), or alter the demand for and consumption of our products and services. We cannot assure you that any such outcome would not be material, and any such outcome could have a material and adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.

Our use of hydraulic fracturing. We use hydraulic fracturing as a means to maximize production of oil and gas from formations having low permeability such that natural flow is restricted. Fracture stimulation has been used for decades in both the Rocky Mountains and Mid-Continent.
Typical hydraulic fracturing treatments are made up of water, chemical additives and sand. We utilize major hydraulic fracturing service companies who track and report additive chemicals that are used in fracturing as required by the appropriate government agencies, including via the FracFocus, the national hydraulic fracturing chemical registry managed by the Ground Water Protection Council and Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission. Each of the service companies we use fracture stimulate a multitude of wells for the industry each year.
We periodically review our plans and policies regarding oil and gas operations, including hydraulic fracturing, in order to minimize any potential environmental impact. Our operations are subject to close supervision by state and federal regulators (including the BLM with respect to federal acreage), who frequently inspect our fracturing operations.
National Environmental Policy Act
Natural gas and oil exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency prepares an Environmental Assessment to evaluate the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project. If impacts are considered significant, the agency will prepare a more detailed environmental impact study that is made available for public review and comment. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. The vast majority of our exploration and production activities are not on federal lands. This environmental impact assessment process has the potential to delay or limit, or increase the cost of, the development of natural gas and oil projects on federal lands. Authorizations under NEPA also are subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can delay or halt projects.
Oil Pollution Act
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the U.S. The OPA and its associated regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. A “responsible party” under the OPA includes owners and operators of certain onshore facilities from which a release may affect waters of the U.S. The OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation. If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by the OPA. The OPA imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill.
Other State Laws
Our properties located in Colorado are subject to the authority of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (the “COGCC”), as well as other state agencies. On August 22, 2017, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper announced seven policy initiatives developed during the Colorado’s review of oil and gas operations. One rulemaking initiative resulting from Colorado’s review is a strengthening of COGCC’s flowline regulations and requirements. COGCC finalized the new flowline rules on February 19. 2018. The new rule includes: increased registration requirements, flowline design requirements, integrity management requirements, leak detection programs and requirements for abandoned flowlines. Over the past several years, the COGCC has also approved new rules regarding various other matters, including wellbore integrity, hydraulic fracturing, well control waste management, spill reporting, and an increase in potential sanctions for COGCC rule’s violations. Additionally, the COGCC approved rules regarding minimum setbacks, groundwater monitoring, large-scale facilities in urban mitigation areas, and public notice requirements that are intended to prevent or mitigate environmental impacts of oil and gas development and include the permitting of wells Depending on how these and any other new rules are applied, they could add substantial increases in well costs for our Colorado operations. The rules could also impact our ability and extend the time necessary to obtain drilling permits, which would create substantial uncertainty about our ability to meet future drilling plans and thus production and capital expenditure targets. The State of Colorado also created a task force to make recommendations for minimizing land use and other conflicts concerning the location of new oil and gas facilities. In early 2016, COGCC finalized a rulemaking to implement rules applicable to the permitting of large-scale oil and gas facilities in urban mitigation areas and

rules requiring operators to register with and provide operational information to municipalities prior to conducting oil and gas operations with notice prior to engaging in certain operations.
In 2016, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that the cities of Fort Collins and Longmont do not have authority to ban oil and gas operations within their jurisdictional limits. Although we do not own or operate within any of these municipal areas, the Colorado Supreme Court decision has bearing on our ability to continue to operate in Colorado. Further, Weld County completed implementation of a revised local government permitting process for land use approval, and Boulder County is substantially revising its oil and gas regulations in conjunction with a permitting moratorium that is about to expire. We do not expect that these local government regulations will have any material impact on our operation.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 156 people and also utilized the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. 
Offices
As of December 31, 2017, we leased 63,783 square feet of office space in Denver, Colorado at 410 17th Street where our principal offices are located, and we leased 7,780 square feet near our operations in Weld County, Colorado, where we have a field office and storage facilities. We also own field offices in Evans, Colorado and Magnolia, Arkansas.
