ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
OVERVIEW
Caladrius Biosciences, Inc. (“we,” “us,” "our," “Caladrius” or the “Company”) is a company developing cellular therapeutics to treat certain diseases. We leverage specialized development expertise to selectively advance therapeutic product candidates to their next significant development milestone and, if appropriate, partner such candidates. Our most advanced product candidate, CLBS03, is an autologous polyclonal regulatory T cell ("Treg") clinical phase 2 therapy targeting children aged 8-17 with recent-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus ("T1D"). We also have phase 2 studies either underway or due to commence shortly involving our CD34 cell therapy for ischemic repair.
Immunomodulation (Treg Technology)
We are developing strategically, through the utilization of our core development expertise, a product candidate (CLBS03) that has the potential to be an innovative therapy for T1D. This therapy is based on a proprietary platform technology for immunomodulation. We have selected as an initial target the unmet medical need of patients who are newly diagnosed with T1D, most of whom will be under the age of 18. This program is based on the use of Tregs to treat diseases caused by imbalances in an individual's immune system. This novel approach seeks to restore immune balance by enhancing Treg number and function. Tregs are a natural part of the human immune system and regulate the activity of effector T cells, the cells that are responsible for protecting the body from pathogens and foreign antigens. When Tregs function properly, only harmful foreign materials are attacked by effector T cells. In autoimmune disease, however, it is thought that deficient Treg activity and numbers permit the effector T cells to attack the body's own beneficial cells. In the case of T1D, the beta cells in the pancreas are attacked, thereby reducing and/or eliminating over time the patient's ability to produce insulin. Insulin is necessary to regulate sugar metabolism and maintain proper sugar levels in the blood. Inconsistent or unnatural insulin levels can lead to many complications, including blindness, vascular disease and, if no insulin supplement is provided, even death. There are currently no curative treatments for TID, only lifelong insulin therapy, which often does not prevent serious co-morbidities. Two Phase 1 clinical trials of Treg technology in T1D, taken together, demonstrated safety and tolerance, feasibility of manufacturing, an implied durability of effect as well as an early indication of potential therapeutic effect through the preservation of beta cell function. In the first quarter of 2016, we commenced patient enrollment in the first of two cohorts in The Sanford Project: T-Rex Study, a Phase 2 prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial (the "TRex Study") to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CLBS03 in adolescents with recent onset TID. We entered into a strategic collaboration with Sanford Research to support the execution of this trial. Sanford Research is a U.S.-based non-profit research organization that supports an emerging translational research center focused on finding a cure for T1D. On February 23, 2017, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine ("CIRM") awarded us funds of up to $12.2 million to support the T-Rex Study. The funding will be based upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the proportion of subjects enrolled in California, as well as manufacturing and development costs incurred in California. We received $5.7 million in initial funding on May 4, 2017. CLBS03 has been granted Fast Track and orphan drug designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") as well as Advanced Therapeutic Medicinal Product ("ATMP") classification from the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"). In October 2016, we received a satisfactory safety evaluation by our independent Data Safety Monitoring Board based on safety data then available from the first 19 patients enrolled in the trial. A subsequent interim analysis was conducted after approximately 50% of patients reached the six-month follow-up milestone, the results of which were publicly released on March 8, 2018, that the therapy continued to be well tolerated and was and deemed non-futile for therapeutic effect. On January 18, 2018, we announced completion of enrollment (110 patients) in the TRex Study.
Ischemic Repair (CD34 Cell Technology)
Our CD34 cell technology has led to the development of therapeutic product candidates designed to address diseases and conditions caused by ischemia. Ischemia occurs when the supply of oxygenated blood to healthy tissue is restricted. Through the administration of CD34 cells, we seek to promote the development and formation of new blood vessels and thereby increase blood flow to the impacted area. We believe that conditions caused by underlying ischemic injury can be improved through our CD34 cell technology, including critical limb ischemia ("CLI"), coronary microvascular disfunction ("CMD") and refractory angina ("RfA"). Published reports in Circulation Cardiovascular Interventions, Atherosclerosis, Stem Cells and Circulation Journal, provide preliminary evidence that CD34 cell therapy is safe and can exert significant therapeutic effects in patients with CLI, a condition in which blood flow to the legs is severely impaired, causing pain and non-healing ulcers and, ultimately, potentially resulting in the need for amputation. Our Clinical Trial Notification for a pivotal Phase 2 trial investigating our product candidate (CLBS12) in CLI was submitted to the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency ("PMDA") and was cleared to proceed. The protocol design was agreed to with PMDA, the study was opened for enrollment in December 2017 and treatment

of the first patient was announced in March 2018. Based on our discussions with the PMDA, we expect that a successful outcome of this trial will qualify CLBS12 for consideration of early conditional approval in Japan. In anticipation of a successful trial outcome and the possibility of conditional approval, we continue to seek a local partner for CLBS12 in Japan. Furthermore, we submitted grant applications in an effort to seek non-dilutive financing to investigate the CD34 technology for additional clinical indications in the United States. On October 2, 2017, we announced the award of a $1.9 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to support a clinical study of CD34 cells in patients with coronary microvascular dysfunction and we are targeting the initiation of the study by early second quarter 2018.
Additional Out-licensing Opportunities
Our broad intellectual property portfolio of cell therapy assets includes notable programs available for out-licensing in order to continue their clinical development. These include additional indications for our Treg product and additional indications for our CD34 cell technology. 
Our current long-term strategy focuses on advancing our therapies through development with the aim of eventually obtaining market authorization, either alone or with partners, to provide treatment options to patients suffering from life-threatening medical conditions. We believe that we are positioned to realize potentially meaningful value increases within our own proprietary pipeline if we are successful in advancing our product candidates to their next significant development milestones. 
Discontinued Operations
On May 18, 2017, we completed the previously announced sale of our remaining 80.1% membership interest in PCT, LLC, a Caladrius company ("PCT") to Hitachi Chemical Co. America, Ltd. ("Hitachi") (the "Sale"), pursuant to the Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") dated as of March 16, 2017, by and among us, PCT and Hitachi, for $75.0 million in cash plus an additional cash adjustment of $4.4 million based on PCT’s cash and outstanding indebtedness as of the closing date and a potential future milestone payment. The sale of PCT represented a strategic shift that has had a major effect on our operations, and therefore, all periods presented were adjusted to reflect PCT as discontinued operations. PCT is now known as Hitachi Chemical Advanced Therapeutic Systems (HCATS).

OVERVIEW OF THE CELL THERAPY FIELD
Regenerative medicine is defined as the process of replacing or regenerating human cells, tissues or organs to restore normal function. Among the categories of therapeutic technology platforms within this field are cell therapy, tissue engineering, tools, device diagnostics and aesthetic medicine. In 2017, the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine recognized over 759 regenerative medicine companies worldwide, including gene and cell therapy developers and over 802 clinical trials. 
All living complex organisms start as a single cell that replicates and differentiates (matures), thereby yielding the vast array of organs and organ systems in an adult organism. Cell therapy is the process that uses cells to prevent, treat or cure disease, or regenerate damaged or aged tissue. To date, the most common type of cell therapy has been the replacement of mature, functioning cells through blood and platelet transfusions. Since the 1970s, marrow and blood and umbilical cord-derived stem cells have been used to restore bone marrow, as well as blood and immune system cells damaged by the chemotherapy and radiation used to treat many cancers. These types of cell therapies are standard practice world-wide and are often reimbursed by insurance.

There are two general classes of cell therapies: autologous and allogeneic. When cells are collected from a person (donor) and are ultimately transplanted into, or used to develop a treatment solely for that patient (recipient) with or without modification, the treatment paradigm is known as “autologous” cell therapy. In cases in which the donor and the recipient are not the same individual, the procedures are referred to as “allogeneic” cell therapy. Patient-Specific Cell Therapy ("PSCT") includes all autologous cell therapies as well as allogeneic cell therapies in which a specific donor's cells are used for a specific matched recipient's treatment. Our immune modulation program focuses on PSCTs. Autologous cells offer a low likelihood of rejection by the patient. In the case of some allogeneic cell therapies, also known as Off-The-Shelf Cell Therapy ("OSCT"), donor cells are expanded many fold in tissue culture and large banks of cells are frozen in individual portions that may result in treatments for many different people. 
Various cell therapies are in clinical development for an array of human diseases, including autoimmune, oncologic, cardiovascular, neurologic and orthopedic diseases, among other indications. While no assurances can be given regarding future medical developments, we believe that the field of cell therapy holds the promise to better the human experience and minimize or ameliorate the pain and suffering from many common and often life-threatening diseases.
CELL THERAPY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
Immune Modulation (T Regulatory Cell Program)
Our T Regulatory Cell program is based on a technology platform derived in part from intellectual property created from research performed at the University of California, San Francisco ("UCSF") and we are pursuing the development of cell therapies designed to use autologous immune cells as a therapeutic product to treat disorders of the immune system. Many immune-mediated diseases are a result of an imbalance between immune effector and regulatory mechanisms whereby pro-inflammatory cells and cytokines eventually go unchecked and mistakenly attack beneficial cells in the body. Our T regulatory cell therapy represents a novel approach to restoring immune balance by enhancing Treg number and function to control pathologic immune responses.
Clinical Development
Through world-wide patent licenses, we have secured the rights to a broad patent estate within the Treg field, including IP related to TID. T1D, also known as insulin dependent diabetes or juvenile diabetes, is caused by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. We have established a collaboration with UCSF and the laboratories of Drs. Jeffrey Bluestone and Qizhi Tang, experts in the field of Tregs and immune tolerance, to develop CLBS03, autologous ex vivo expanded polyclonal Tregs, for the treatment of T1D. This collaboration has advanced our Treg Program to a Phase 2 trial, initiated in the first quarter of 2016, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous Tregs in patients recently diagnosed with T1D. 
A Phase 1 open-label uncontrolled dose escalation study of autologous Treg immunotherapy for T1D was funded by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and conducted by Dr. Stephen Gitelman at UCSF and Dr. Kevan Harold at Yale University, in collaboration with Dr. Bluestone. Results were published by Dr. Gitelman in Science Translational Medicine in November 2015. This clinical trial provided preliminary safety and feasibility data supporting the development of a novel therapy for the treatment of T1D with the goal of inducing immune tolerance and preserving pancreatic beta cell function. The investigators in that study reported that 14 patients between 18 and 45 years of age with a mean duration of disease of 10 months received a single infusion of one of four doses of autologous expanded Tregs. The majority of adverse events reported were mild. There were three serious adverse events, or SAEs, two of which were deemed unrelated to treatment by the investigator and a third SAE of grade 3 pre-syncope was deemed unlikely related. Common side effects included mild infections. Infused Tregs peaked in circulation three to seven days after infusion and were detectable at up to twelve months. The average levels of stimulated C-peptide, an indicator of pancreatic islets beta cell function that was measured in the clinical trial as a safety biomarker, for some patients remained stable from baseline for as long as two years post treatment. These data suggest that the treatment was manageable and did not adversely affect residual beta cell function. The Tregs were observed to be highly functional and relatively long lived in treated individuals.
While the U.S. Phase 1 clinical trial was designed to evaluate safety and tolerability in adults who suffered T1D for various durations, supportive evidence of the utility of Tregs for T1D in humans was provided by a study of pediatric patients 5 to 18 years of age with new onset T1D, as published in the July 2014 issue of Clinical Immunology. In that open label non-randomized study conducted in Poland, Marek-Trzonkowska, et al. reported that treatment with expanded autologous Tregs preserved function of pancreatic beta cells and reduced the need for exogenous insulin in the majority of patients treated. Through 12 months of follow-up, about 66% of the 12 children treated were in remission, according to study specified criteria, compared to only 20% of 10 concurrent controls. In addition, two (or about 17%) of Treg treated children achieved complete insulin independence, while none of the children in the control group achieved this endpoint. Importantly, the study utilized a Treg -ased product similar to CLBS03 and provided additional information on the safety and feasibility of this approach in new onset children with T1D.
In the first quarter of 2016, we commenced patient enrollment in the first of two cohorts in The Sanford Project: T-Rex Study, a Phase 2 prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial (the "T-Rex Study") to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CLBS03 in adolescents with recent onset TID. We entered into a strategic collaboration with Sanford Research to

support the execution of this trial. Sanford Research is a U.S. based non-profit research organization that supports an emerging translational research center focused on finding a cure for T1D. On February 23, 2017, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine ("CIRM") awarded us funds of up to $12.2 million to support the T-Rex Study. The funding will be based upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the proportion of subjects enrolled in California, as well as manufacturing and development costs incurred in California. We received $5.7 million in initial funding on May 4, 2017. CLBS03 has been granted Fast Track and orphan drug designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") as well as Advanced Therapeutic Medicinal Product ("ATMP") classification from the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"). In October 2016, we received satisfactory safety evaluation by our independent Data Safety Monitoring Board based on safety data then available from the first 19 patients enrolled in the trial. A subsequent interim analysis was conducted after approximately 50% of patients reached the six-month follow-up milestone, the results of which were publicly released on March 8, 2018, that the therapy drug continued to be well tolerated and was deemed non-futile for therapeutic effect. On January 18, 2018, we announced completion of enrollment (110) patients in the TRex Study. 
Market Opportunity and Competition
In 2015, The International Diabetes Foundation Atlas, 7th Ed. reported that, worldwide, an estimated 86,000 children younger than 15 develop T1D annually, with annual increases in incidence of about 3%. In the United States, a SEARCH for National Diabetes Statistic Report, 2014 cites an annual incidence of 18,436 in newly diagnosed individuals less than 20 years of age. T1D inflicts a significant economic cost on the U.S. healthcare system, estimated at $14.4 billion annually, and it is expected that a therapy that can modify the course of T1D could potentially achieve significant cost savings, and thus command high market penetration and premium pricing. In the near future, the market for T1D is expected to continue to be dominated by insulin replacement therapies. Other novel approaches, however, including immune modulatory agents such as CLBS03, are expected progressively to penetrate the market as the magnitude and durability of their therapeutic effect becomes well characterized. 
Currently, there are no approved therapies for new onset T1D with potential curative effect but only regimens such as insulin or adjuvants to insulin that address the disease when the pancreas can no longer produce insulin. While not a direct competitor, in a more advanced population of T1D, sotagliflozin, an oral adjunctive therapy to insulin, is expected to receive FDA approval following positive results from a pivotal Phase 3 trial conducted by Lexicon Pharmaceuticals in collaboration with Sanofi SA and JDRF. There are multiple agents in development targeting the modification of the course of the disease. Current approaches in development can be broadly divided into immune modulatory agents that attempt to improve metabolic function by rescuing insulin producing beta cells, or regenerative agents that attempt to replace beta cells. From a broad review of these agents and approaches, no other therapy for new-onset T1D is expected to be in advanced clinical trials or provide direct competition to our polyclonal regulatory T cell platform in the near future.
Ischemic Repair (CD34 Cell Technology)
Our CD34 cell technology has led to the development of therapeutic candidates designed to address diseases and conditions caused by ischemia. Ischemia occurs when the supply of oxygenated blood to healthy tissue is restricted. Through the administration of CD34 cells, we seek to promote the development and formation of new blood vessels and thereby eliminate the ischemic condition. We believe that conditions caused by underlying ischemic injury can be improved by the administration of our CD34 cell technology. Published reports provide preliminary evidence that CD34 cell therapy is safe and can exert significant therapeutic effects in patients with CLI, a condition in which blood flow to the legs is severely impaired, causing pain and non-healing ulcers and, ultimately, potentially resulting in the need for amputation. Prior studies have shown benefits of CD34 cell therapy that included pain relief, ulcer healing and reduced amputation rates. Conditions such as CLI are often difficult to study in large randomized controlled programs and Japan’s recent Regenerative Medicine Law is designed to advance regenerative medicine therapies such as these. The new regulations support conditional approval when there is data to show sufficient safety and some preliminary evidence of therapeutic effect. We explored how best to work within the Japanese Regenerative Medicine Law framework to advance this and potentially other programs through extensive consultations with the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). We then submitted to the PMDA a Clinical Trial Notification for a pivotal Phase 2 trial to investigate our product candidate (CLB12) in CLI, for which the PMDA provided clearance for us to proceed. The protocol design, as well as the CMC and quality plans, were agreed to with PMDA and we opened the study for enrollment in December 2017. Based on our discussion with the PMDA, a successful outcome of this trial is expected to qualify CLBS12 for consideration of early conditional approval in Japan. In anticipation of a successful trial result and the possibility of conditional approval in Japan, we continue to seek a local partner for CLBS12 in Japan. Furthermore, we submitted grant applications in an effort to seek non-dilutive financing to investigate the CD34 technology for additional clinical indications in the United States.        
The goal of CLBS12 is to prevent the serious adverse consequences of no-option CLI (cases where there is no longer the potential for other treatment beyond amputation) by extending the time of continuous CLI free status through improved blood flow in the affected limb. We also believe a CD34 product could have potential in treating other cardiovascular and/or peripheral arterial diseases such as claudication, refractory angina and Syndrome X, also known as coronary microvascular disfunction. On October 2, 2017, we announced the award of a $1.9 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to support a clinical study of CD34 cells (CLBS14-CMD) in patients with coronary microvascular dysfunction ("CMD" or "Syndrome X") and target the

initiation of the study by early second quarter 2018. In addition, on March 7, 2018, we announced that we acquired from Shire plc (Nasdaq: SHPG) an exclusive worldwide license to data from a late stage CD34 cell therapy program for the treatment of chronic myocardial ischemia targeting refractory angina. Under the terms of the agreement Caladrius received the exclusive worldwide rights to the data set and regulatory filings for the CD34 cell therapy program for the treatment of refractory angina in exchange for an upfront consideration, milestones and a royalty on product sales. The comprehensive data set that Caladrius licensed includes preclinical (in vivo and in vitro) and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical study data of CD34 cell therapy as a treatment for no-option refractory angina, along with the corresponding regulatory filings. Upon reactivation of the Baxalta IND under the sponsorship of Caladrius, the Company will proceed with discussions with FDA to determine the most expeditious path to potential approval for this product candidate, now known as CLBS14-RfA.
TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES
Immune Modulation (T Regulatory Cell Technology)
Our Treg technology platform is potentially applicable to multiple autoimmune and allergic diseases beyond our current target indication of TID. For example, certain evidence suggests that a failure of Tregs may be important in the development systemic lupus erythematosus ("SLE") and that Treg therapy may therefore be helpful in treatment of SLE. Additionally, Tregs have been evaluated in early phase human clinical trials and have indicated clinical benefit, for graft-versus-host disease ("GVHD"). Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and inflammatory bowel disease are other indications for which we believe Tregs may have a meaningful therapeutic effect. Trials sponsored by the University of California, San Francisco are currently underway for active cutaneous lupus and immune tolerance following kidney transplantation.

Index

In Japan there are roughly 24,000 patients with CLI, of whom roughly 11,000 are not candidates for revascularization, making them the addressable population for CLBS12. The addressable population is roughly 1.4 million in the EU and 1.3 million in the U.S. 
The field of cardiovascular cell therapy development is competitive. There are a number of companies that are developing stem cell-based therapies for cardiovascular diseases, including, but not limited to, Celyad, Capricor, Inc., Mesoblast Limited, Athersys, Inc., Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. and Vericel Corporation. These companies are utilizing a number of different therapeutic approaches in their development efforts. There are both autologous and allogeneic based competitive therapies that derive cells principally from four sources: fat, peripheral blood, cord blood, and bone marrow. CLBS12 is an autologous therapy that derives its cells from peripheral blood via apheresis. Stempeutics Research Pvt. Ltd. and the joint venture between Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. and Sosei CVC, are examples of companies also seeking to launch clinical trials in Japan for allogeneic cell therapy product candidates for CLI.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
The health care industry is one of the most highly regulated industries in the United States and abroad. Various governmental regulatory authorities, as well as private accreditation organizations, oversee and monitor the activities of individuals and businesses engaged in the development, manufacture and delivery of health care products and services. The following is a general description of certain current laws and regulations that are relevant to our business. 
Pharmaceutical and Biologic Product and Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising and promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical and biological products, such as CLBS03, CLBS12 or CLBS14. The process of obtaining required regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and money, and there is no guarantee that we will successfully complete the steps needed to obtain regulatory approval of CLBS03, CLBS12, CLBS14-CMD or CLBS14-RfA or any future product candidates. In addition, these regulations may change and our product candidates may be subject to new laws or regulations.
In the United States, pharmaceutical and biologic products, including cellular therapies, are subject to extensive pre- and post- market regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act ("PHS Act"). However, because most biological products also meet the definition of “drugs” under the FD&C Act, they are also subject to regulation under FD&C Act provisions. The PHS Act requires the submission of a biologics license application ("BLA"), rather than a New Drug Application ("NDA"), for market authorization. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are similar to those for NDAs, and the review process for biologics is associated with similar approval risks and costs as the process for drugs.
Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial 
9

Index

sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. Under certain circumstances, individual members of company management may also be subject to civil or criminal penalties related to company violations of applicable legal requirements.
Pharmaceutical and biologic product development in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests; submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical trials can commence and the performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical and other nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to initiate a clinical trial if FDA raises concerns or questions about the design of the clinical trial or the preclinical or manufacturing information supporting it, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations; good clinical practices ("GCPs"), as set forth in FDA guidance, which is meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; and under FDA-approved protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Sponsors of most clinical trials involving FDA regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry and results database. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public on the database as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements, or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board ("IRB") at each institution at which the trial will be performed. It will review the proposed research to ensure compliance with applicable research and ethical guidelines. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements.
Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Under certain circumstances, a fourth post-approval phase may be required.

• | Phase 1: Trials in this phase are initially conducted in a limited population of healthy volunteers to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients, when the drug or biologic is too toxic to be ethically given to healthy individuals. 


• | Phase 2: These clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify appropriate therapeutic dose and dose frequency as well as any corresponding additional possible adverse effects and safety risks and to determine the presence and approximate magnitude of therapeutic effect of the product for specific targeted indications. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 


• | Phase 3: These are commonly referred to as pivotal or registration studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are typically undertaken in a larger patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple and geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. In most cases, FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug as a requirement for registration.

• | Phase 4: In some cases, FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor's agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA or BLA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily carry out additional trials post approval to gain more information about the drug or biologic.

Expedited Review and Approval

FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track Program, the sponsor of an IND for a drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the drug candidate. FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.

Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients beyond existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.

In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post- approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. Unless otherwise informed by the FDA, for an accelerated approval product an applicant must submit to the FDA for consideration during the preapproval review period copies of all promotional materials, including promotional labeling as well as advertisements, intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval. After 120 days following marketing approval, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the applicant must submit promotional materials at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination of the labeling or initial publication of the advertisement

In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with FDA, FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug’s NDA before the application is complete. This "rolling review' is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application, however, does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by FDA if FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
During Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3 clinical development, FDA may designate an investigational product as a Breakthrough Therapy or as a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy. Breakthrough Therapy ("RMAT") designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). RMAT designation may be granted if: (a) the product candidate is a regenerative medicine therapy, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and part 1271 of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations; (b) the product candidate is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (c) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Either a breakthrough or RMAT designation may help accelerate product development by allowing more frequent interactions with FDA and receiving intensive FDA guidance on efficient drug development.
After completion and analysis of the results of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. Under federal law, most NDA or BLA submissions are additionally subject to a substantial application user fee. The current fee for FY2018 is $2,421,495 and an annual program fee, currently $304,162, must also be paid for approved drugs or biologics. These fees are typically adjusted annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing

based on the agency's threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under certain NDA and BLA review performance goals to which FDA has agreed, most applications for standard review of drug or biologic products are reviewed within ten to twelve months, and most applications for priority review drugs or biologics are reviewed within six to eight months. If a sponsor submits a major amendment to a filed NDA or BLA at any time during the review cycle, FDA may extend these reviews by three months. Priority review can be applied to drugs or biologics that, in the FDA's determination, offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment for a disease or condition for which no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited to products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease relative to currently approved products.
The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biologic products, or drug or biologic products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but the FDA will carefully consider them.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCPs. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMPs, including the establishment of a quality system to regulate manufacturing operations, is satisfactory and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug or biologic is safe and effective for the proposed indication.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, the FDA issues an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmitted NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions within two or six months, depending on the type of information included.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act ("PREA") NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers or deferrals for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act ("BPCA") provides approved NDA and BLA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity that attaches to the end of all existing marketing exclusivities and patents for the drug. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product but limited to the specific, approved indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation, the sponsor receives tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.

Japan’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Authority Regulation of Regenerative Medicine
Prior to 2014 there was no specific regulatory oversight of regenerative medicine products in Japan. However, in November 2013, the Japanese Diet revised the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law and renamed it the Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, and Other Therapeutic Products Act (the "PMD Act"). The new legislation became effective on November 25, 2014 and provides for a timely introduction of innovative regenerative medicine products. The new legislation formalizes a legal basis for development of regenerative medicine therapies. The new legislation defines regenerative medicine products as processed human cells that are intended to be used for either (1) the reconstructive repair, or formation of structures or functions of the human body; (2) the treatment or prevention of human diseases; or (3) gene therapy.
The legislation allows the PMDA/Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare ("MHLW") to award conditional approval to a regenerative medicine therapy if there is evidence of adequate safety and results which predict likely efficacy. The evidence for efficacy may be based on surrogate endpoints and may come from an exploratory study. This conditional approval is time-limited, and there must be an agreement with PMDA/MHLW as to follow-up collection of information which confirms efficacy and safety, similar to a post-marketing commitment in the United States.
Under the PMD Act, products under consideration may also be given a sakigake designation (similar to a fast track designation) or may be granted a priority review status. Additionally, there is a commitment that the PMDA will facilitate research and development by giving scientific and regulatory advice to sponsors from the early stage of development.
According to the new legislation, the sponsor prepares a marketing authorization application which is submitted for review to the PMDA. The PMDA reviews the application and prepares a review report and recommendation which is submitted to the MHLW. The MHLW reviews the recommendation and makes a decision regarding approval of the product. This procedure is followed for both a conditional approval and subsequently for a full approval after the post-marketing commitments have been fulfilled.
