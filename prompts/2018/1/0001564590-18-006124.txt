ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 We are a leading pop culture consumer products company. Our business is built on the principle that almost everyone is a fan of something and the evolution of pop culture is leading to increasing opportunities for fan loyalty. We create whimsical, fun and unique products that enable fans to express their affinity for their favorite “something”—whether it is a movie, TV show, video game, musician or sports team. We typically infuse our distinct designs and aesthetic sensibility into one of the industry’s largest portfolios of licensed content over a wide variety of product categories, including figures, plush, accessories, apparel, hand bags and homewares. With our unique style, expertise in pop culture, broad product distribution and highly accessible price points, we have developed a passionate following for our products that has underpinned our growth. We believe we sit at the nexus of pop culture—content providers value us for our broad network of retail customers, retailers value us for our broad portfolio of licensed pop culture products and pop culture insights, and consumers value us for our distinct, stylized products and the content they represent. We believe our innovative product design and market positioning have disrupted the licensed product markets and helped to define today’s pop culture products category.
 Pop culture pervades modern life and almost everyone is a fan of something. In the past, pop culture fandom was often associated with stereotypical images of fans from narrow demographics, such as Star Trek fans attending conventions to speak Klingon to each other or friends getting together to play Dungeons & Dragons. Today, more quality content is available and technology innovation has made content accessible anytime, anywhere. As a result, the breadth and depth of pop culture fandom resembles, and in many cases exceeds, the type of fandom previously associated only with sports. Social media has further allowed for fans to share their love and form communities easier than before. Everyday interactions at home, work or with friends, whether in person or through social media, are increasingly influenced by pop culture.
 We have invested strategically in our relationships with key constituents in pop culture. Content providers value us for our broad network of retail customers and retailers value us for our broad portfolio of licensed pop culture products, pop culture insights and ability to drive consumer traffic. Consumers, who value us for our distinct, stylized products, remain at the center of everything we do.
 
• | Content Providers: We have strong licensing relationships with many established content providers, such as Disney, HBO, LucasFilm, Marvel, Blizzard Entertainment, the National Football League and Warner Brothers. We strive to license every pop culture property that we believe is relevant to consumers. We believe our numerous licensing relationships have allowed us to build one of the largest portfolios in our industry, and from which we can create multiple products based on each character within those properties. Content providers trust us to create unique, stylized extensions of their intellectual property that extend the relevance of their content with consumers through ongoing engagement, helping to maximize the lifetime value of their content. We believe we have benefited from a trend of content providers consolidating their relationships to do more business with fewer licensees. Our track record of obtaining licenses from content providers, together with our proven ability to renew and extend the scope of our licenses, demonstrates the trust content providers place in us.

• | Retail Channels: We sell our products through a diverse network of retail customers across multiple retail channels, including specialty retailers, mass-market retailers and e-commerce sites. We can provide our retail customers a customized product mix designed to appeal to their particular customer bases. Our current retail customers include Amazon, GameStop, Hot Topic, Target and Walmart in the United States, and Micromania, E.M.P. Merchandising and Smyths Toys, internationally. Retailers recognize the opportunity presented by the demand for pop culture products and are continuing to dedicate additional shelf space as well as increased presence on their e-commerce platform to our products and the pop culture category. Additionally, some of our retail customers, such as Target and Walmart, view us as pop culture experts, and we help them manage their pop culture category. We believe we drive meaningful traffic to our retail customers’ stores because our products have their own built-in fan base, are refreshed regularly creating a “treasure hunt” shopping experience for consumers, and are often supplemented with exclusive, limited-time products that are highlighted on

social media. We believe these merchandising strategies create a sense of urgency with consumers that encourages repeat visits to our retail customers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumers: Fans are increasingly looking for ways to express their affinity for and engage with their favorite pop culture content. Over time, many of our consumers evolve from occasional buyers to more frequent purchasers, whom we categorize as enthusiasts or collectors. We estimate that enthusiasts, who are more engaged in pop culture, and collectors, who regularly purchase our products and self-identify as collectors, each make up approximately one-third of our customers. We create products to appeal to a broad array of fans across consumer demographic groups—men, women, boys and girls—not a single, narrow demographic. We offer a large number of products across our product categories. Our products are generally priced under $10, excluding apparel and handbags, which generally are priced at a higher range, which allows our diverse consumer base to express their fandom frequently and impulsively. We continue to introduce innovative products designed to facilitate fan engagement across different price points and styles in different categories. In addition, our fans routinely express their passion for our products and brands through social media and live pop culture events, such as Comic-Con or Star Wars Celebration.

 We have developed a nimble and low fixed cost production model. The strength of our in-house creative team and relationships with content providers, retailers and third-party manufacturers allows us to move from product concept to pre-selling a new product in as few as 24 hours. We typically have a new figure on the store shelf between 110 and 200 days and can have it on the shelf in as few as 70 days in certain circumstances. As a result, we can dynamically manage our business to balance current content releases and pop culture trends with content based on classic evergreen properties, such as Mickey Mouse or classic Batman. This has allowed us to deliver significant growth while lessening our dependence on individual content releases.
 Recent Developments 
 On November 6, 2017
, we completed our IPO of 10,416,666 shares
 of Class A common stock at an initial public offering price of $12.00
 per share and received approximately $117.3 million
 in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. We used the net proceeds to purchase 10,416,666 newly issued common units directly from FAH, LLC at a price per unit equal to 
the price per share of Class A common stock in the IPO less underwriting discounts and commissions of $117.3 million. Immediately following the completion of the IPO, there were 24,975,932 shares
 of Class B common stock outstanding and 23,337,705 shares of
 Class A common stock outstanding, comprised of 10,416,666 shares
 issued in connection with the IPO and 12,921,039 shares issued in connection with the Transactions described in Note 16, Stockholders’ Equity of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
 Leading Design and Creative Capabilities
 Our in-house creative team layers our own whimsical, fun and distinct stylization onto content providers’ characters, creating unique products for which there is substantial consumer demand. Our creative team is passionate about pop culture. We enjoy a strong pipeline of talent for our creative team given our culture and the opportunity we provide to work with the most relevant pop culture content. We believe content providers trust us with their properties, and consumers passionately engage with our products and brands because of our creativity. In addition, we reinvigorate classic evergreen or back catalog content by infusing a fresh, unique aesthetic and design into characters that enjoy enduring passion and nostalgia from fans. 
Diversity of Products and Accessible Price Points Create Broad Appeal
 We create products to appeal to a broad array of fans across consumer demographic groups. We believe our broad appeal comes through our large selection of items, a large variety of licenses and properties and varied form factors across a number of product categories. We do not limit ourselves by targeting discrete demographics such as the stereotypical collector or the child seeking the latest (and often short-lived) toy craze. We estimate based on market and internal data that occasional buyers, which we define as those consumers who are mainstream movie and TV fans, but do not self-identify as enthusiasts, and enthusiasts, who are more engaged in pop culture than occasional buyers but who do not self-identify as collectors, each make up approximately one- third of our customers. To continue to broaden our offerings beyond figures, we have launched new or expanded 
 5
 
categories such as plush and accessories. We believe we have one of the largest and most engaged fan bases in our industry, driven by their passion and love of our unique products and the properties we represent.
 Trusted Steward of the Most Important Pop Culture Content
 We strive to license every pop culture property that we believe is relevant to our consumers. Over the last decade, we have built strong relationships with content providers and currently have a catalog of content licenses covering a large number of properties that we believe is one of the industry’s largest. We believe there is a trend of content providers consolidating their relationships to do more business with fewer licensees. As a trusted steward with a strong retail distribution network and connection with the end user, we believe we have benefited from this trend. We often work collaboratively with content providers in advance of new content releases to create unique, stylized products to maximize the value of their properties. In some cases, the input we have provided has influenced the content provider’s creative choices for its original content. We believe we are well positioned to continue to obtain licenses for new important movie franchises and other properties. Further, we have historically been able to renew productive licenses on commercially reasonable terms, which positions us to benefit from the ongoing desire of consumers to engage with and show affinity for their favorite pop culture content.
Deep, Mutually Beneficial Relationships with a Broad Network of Retail Customers
 We partner with a diverse group of retail customers through which we sell our products. Many of our retail customers view us as experts in pop culture and in some cases, we help manage their pop culture category within their stores and can provide a curated experience by catering to their particular customer bases. We believe this enables us to enhance the productivity of the pop culture category for our retail customers, resulting in increased sales and expanded shelf space or online placement for our products—a major driver of our growth historically. Additionally, we believe our pop culture expertise and omnichannel sales model position us well to capture the industry shift from traditional brick and mortar stores to channel-agnostic content consumerism. In addition, we often release exclusive new products with a specific retail customer, which can drive traffic and sales for them.
Nimble Speed to Market Reflects “Fast Fashion” Product Development Process
 Speed to market has become increasingly important as technological innovation has accelerated the pace of content discovery and sharing and the speed at which niche content can become mainstream. Our flexible and low-fixed cost production model enables us to go from product design of a figure to the store shelf between 110 and 200 days and can have it on the shelf in as few as 70 days, with a minimal upfront investment for most figures of $5,000 to $7,500 in tooling, molds and internal design costs. Because of the strength of our in-house creative team, we are able to move from product design to pre-selling a new product in as few as 24 hours. This ability, coupled with the valuable data insights we have developed over the past decade, and the increasing use of repeated franchise properties by content providers, reduces potential product risk to us while better positioning us to benefit from trends in content creation and consumption. As an example of our “fast fashion” product development process, we announced and were able to pre-sell a dancing Baby Groot figure, which was a surprise character in Marvel’s 2014 Guardians of the Galaxy movie release, within a week of the movie release.
Dynamic Business Model Drives Revenue Visibility and Growth
 Our business is diversified across content providers and properties, product categories, and sales channels. As a result, we can dynamically manage our business to capitalize on pop culture trends, which has allowed us to deliver significant growth while lessening our dependence on individual content releases. Our content provider relationships are highly diversified. We generated approximately 8% and 15% of sales from our top property for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the portion of our sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 attributable to our top five properties was 23% and 36%, respectively. Our products are balanced across our licensed property categories. In 2017, we generated approximately 45% of sales from classic evergreen properties, approximately 21% from movie release properties, approximately 15% from current video game properties and approximately 18% from current TV properties. In 2016, we generated approximately 43% of sales from classic evergreen properties, approximately 24% from movie release properties, approximately 20% from current video game properties and approximately 12% from current TV properties. We have visibility into the new release schedule of our content providers and our expansive license portfolio allows us to dynamically manage new product creation. This allows us to adjust the mix of products based on classic evergreen properties and new releases, depending on the media release cycle. In addition, we typically sell our 
 6
 
products worldwide through a diverse group of sales channels, including specialty retailers, distributors, mass- market retailers, e-commerce sites and direct-to-consumer.
 Visionary Management Team and Employees with Genuine Passion for Pop Culture
 Our highly experienced management team is led by Brian Mariotti, an industry pioneer. A long- time pop culture fan, Brian recognized early on the impact that trends in media and entertainment would have on the pop culture industry and the value of having a diverse portfolio of licenses. Passion for pop culture pervades our company and our openness to new ideas from anywhere in the organization has resulted in some of our most innovative and differentiated products.
How We Plan to Grow
 We are pursuing the following strategies that we believe will drive substantial future growth.
 Increase Sales with Existing Retail Customers
 We intend to continue to increase our sales by expanding our shelf space and deepening our relationships with our retail customers. Our products have driven traffic to our retail customers’ previously less productive square footage, which has resulted in increased shelf space for our products. In addition to designing unique, stylized products that resonate with pop culture fans and drive traffic, both online and in store, we intend to increase the number of retail customers for whom we curate pop culture selections. We believe doing so deepens our relationships with our retail customers and encourages them to allocate more shelf space to our products and pop culture products generally and, in some cases, create pop culture departments where none existed before, which we believe will drive additional brand awareness and sales growth. We are also in the process of creating a self-service online portal for our retail customers to reduce ordering time and increase the efficiency of our ordering process, which we believe will increase our sales with our existing retail customers.
Add New Retail Customers and Expand into New Channels
 We regularly evaluate and add new retail customers as we believe consumers demand Funko products regardless of the retail channel through which they purchase them. While we believe we have opportunities to add new retailers within existing channels, we also plan to selectively target new or underdeveloped sales channels, such as dollar, drug, grocery and convenience stores. By adding new retail customers, we will increase the awareness and availability of our products to consumers, which we believe will increase sales.
Broaden Our Product Offerings
 In addition to designing products to address new content that licensors continually produce, we plan to add new product categories, lines and brands to leverage our existing sales channels to continue to drive sales. For example, we expanded our blindbox offerings, which have historically included figures, to plush products. We also continually evaluate product innovations and potential acquisition targets to complement our existing product categories, lines and brands. In June 2017, we completed the acquisition of Loungefly, LLC ( “Loungefly”), a designer of a variety of licensed pop culture fashion handbags, small leather goods and accessories, to expand and diversify our product offerings in our accessories category (the “Loungefly Acquisition”). 
Expand Internationally
 We believe that the forces at work first observed in the U.S. pop culture industry are global. We believe we are currently underpenetrated internationally, and we generate the majority of our net sales in the United States; however, we are also focused on growing our international business. Net sales generated from customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 27%, 19% and 24% of our sales for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We are continuing to invest in the growth of our international business both directly and through third party distributors. In the future we may pursue similar acquisitions or expand our direct sales force or distributor relationships to further penetrate Asia Pacific, Latin America, Australia or other regions.

Leverage the Funko Brand Across Multiple Channels
 We believe there is a significant opportunity to leverage our distinctive style and designs across numerous underserved channels such as digital content, as well as potentially movies and television. For example, we are in the process of creating an online portal for Funko that will serve as an online destination for our consumers. This online community will allow consumers to create personal avatars, purchase digital products and interact with other consumers. We believe this opportunity will drive brand awareness with new audience segments, deepen consumer engagement to drive customer lifetime value, strengthen our direct connection with our consumers and grow our direct-to-consumer business, as well as support our retail customers.
Product Lines and Licenses
 We sell a broad array of licensed pop culture consumer products featuring characters from an extensive range of media and entertainment content, including movies, TV shows, video games, music and sports. Our products combine our proprietary brands and distinct designs and aesthetic sensibilities into properties we license from content providers. We seek to license content that will allow us to capitalize on the popularity of current movies, TV shows, video games, music and other content releases, as well as classic evergreen properties, which are not tied to a current release, and which are less subject to pop culture trends. We have also developed our own content and intellectual property, such as our Wetmore Forest property. 
Our Products
 Our current products principally fall within the following product categories.
 Figures. Our figures category includes figures that celebrate pop culture icons in the form of stylized vinyl, bobble heads, blind-packed miniatures and action figures. These figures combine the pop culture properties we license with our own distinctive designs to create pop culture figures that appeal to a broad range of consumers at an affordable price point, often under one of our proprietary brands, such as Pop!, Mystery Minis, Dorbz, Pint Size Heroes and Rock Candy.
 Other. Our other category includes plush products that are soft-sculpt figures that blend licensed content with our distinctive designs to create an array of product lines, intended for consumers of all ages; accessories products that mix pop culture fandom with functionality, and feature everything from pens and pins to buttons and keychains, all based on pop culture icons; apparel (including t-shirts and hats); homewares (including drinkware, party lights and other home accessories); and stylized bags, purses and wallets.
Our Brands and Designs
 Under the Funko brand, we have developed multiple proprietary brands under which we market most of our products. We also continuously develop new product designs and lines, which may develop into proprietary brands in the future. Our principal proprietary brands include: Pop!, Mystery Minis, Dorbz, Pint Size Heroes, Rock Candy, SuperCute and Loungefly.
 Pop!. Introduced in 2010, Pop! is our most well-recognized brand. The Pop! stylized design incorporates an equal head to body ratio with an oversized, rounded square head that typically consists of no mouth and a very simple nose. Pop! figures typically stand about four inches tall. The Pop! design has also been applied across all of our other product categories, including plush, accessories, apparel and homewares. As a brand, Pop! represented 70%, 64% and 75% of our 2017, 2016 and 2015 sales, respectively.
 Mystery Minis. Introduced in 2013, Mystery Minis are usually sets of 12 different figures per property sold individually in a blind box so that the consumer does not know which figure from the set they have purchased. The figures are all highly stylized, but the style can vary based on the licensor. The figures themselves are typically two and a half inches tall and can have varying rarity within the set to create a “treasure hunt” appeal. 
 Dorbz. Introduced in 2015, Dorbz are adorable stylized figures with slightly sculpted round heads on uniform pad printed bodies. The figures stand about three inches tall and are packaged in a double window box. The designs incorporate an equal head to body ratio with smiling features.
 8
 
Pint Size Heroes. Introduced in 2015, Pint Size Heroes are slightly stylized figures with sculpted heads and uniform bodies. They stand one and a half inches tall and have an equal head to body ratio. Released in sets of 24 by property, they are packaged in a blind bag so that the consumer does not know which figure they are purchasing.
 Rock Candy. Introduced in 2015, Rock Candy figures are primarily based on female characters holding a strong pose. The figures stand five inches tall, are stylized and have slightly larger heads and eyes, with a head to body ratio of one to two.
 SuperCute. Introduced in 2016, SuperCute is a nostalgia storybook stylized design that has a head to body ratio of two to three. The figures have large round eyes, no nose and a small mouth. The bodies are very simple and have their arms at their sides and their legs pushed together. The SuperCute brand and design have been applied to various Mystery Minis sets and certain plush figures.
 Loungefly. Acquired in June 2017, Loungefly products are fashion focused stylized handbags, backpacks, small leather goods and accessories. Loungefly products currently are based on a limited set of licenses, however, we anticipate expanding the licenses and content used to create our Loungefly products in the future.
 In addition, we also develop product lines that we market under the broader Funko brand, rather than under any of our proprietary brands. We typically do so when we believe our speed to market or other competitive advantages uniquely position us to take advantage of certain opportunities. While these products may not initially be associated with one of our proprietary brands, they can still reflect our whimsical and creative style, and may develop into a distinct brand over time. For example, in 2015, we entered into a master license in connection with the video game property Five Nights at Freddy’s, under which we created a broad array of products, including figures, plush and keychains. Sales of products made under our Five Nights at Freddy’s license accounted for 8% and 15% of our sales for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Similar to Five Nights at Freddy’s, in October 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Netflix for its Stranger Things property to create and sell a wide variety of products, including figures, blindbox, accessories and apparel.  
 Our Licenses
 Licensors. We have strong licensing relationships with many established content providers, such as Disney, HBO, LucasFilm, Marvel, the National Football League, Blizzard Entertainment and Warner Brothers. We also seek to establish licensing relationships with newer content providers in order to capitalize on new and emerging trends in pop culture. For example, in recent years, we have established relationships and entered into licensing arrangements with each of Dr. Seuss, Netflix and Riot Games related to the Dr. Seuss, Stranger Things and League of Legends properties, respectively. We believe we provide value to content providers by maximizing the lifetime value of their content by extending its relevance to consumers through ongoing fan engagement. 
 License Agreements. Our license agreements permit us to use the intellectual property of our licensors in connection with the products we design and sell. These license agreements typically provide that our licensors own intellectual property rights in the products we design and sell under the license, and as a result, upon termination of the license, we no longer have the right to sell these products. A number of these license agreements relate to properties that are significant to our business and operations. Our license agreements typically have terms of between two and three years and are not automatically renewable. However, we believe we have strong relationships with our licensors, and have historically been able to renew productive licenses on commercially reasonable terms.
Our license agreements require us to make royalty payments to the licensor based on our sales of the licensed product and, in some cases, require us to incur other charges. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the average royalty rate was 15.0%, 15.2% and 14.9%, respectively. Our royalty expense for any given year will vary depending on the mix of products sold during that year. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred royalty expenses of $77.5 million, $64.7 million and $40.8 million, respectively.
 Our licenses are generally not exclusive. In addition, the rights that licensors grant to us are typically limited to specific properties, product categories, territories and, in some cases, sales channels. In addition, our license agreements usually require us to obtain the licensor’s approval of products we develop under the license prior to 
 9
 
making any sales. They also typically provide for a minimum guarantee that covers all licensed properties under that license agreement, which is generally required to be paid in advance, and the amount of which is negotiated based on a variety of factors, including past and expected sales and the licensor’s expected line-up of new releases. 
 Historically, we have a strong track record for meeting minimum guarantees under our license agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded reserves of $2.9 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, related to prepaid royalties we estimated would not be recovered through sales. The increase in the reserves from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to our subscription box business, which we are phasing out in 2018.
 For the year ended December 31, 2017, there were no license agreements that accounted for more than 10% of sales. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 15% of sales were related to one license agreement. For the Successor 2015 Period, we had two license agreements that accounted for 23% and 12% of sales. 
 Licensed Properties. We strive to license every pop culture property that we believe is relevant to consumers. What we consider to be a property will vary based on the terms of the underlying license agreement. In general, we consider each content title to constitute a single property. In some instances, however, a property may consist of an entire franchise or even a single character, particularly in our classic evergreen category. We divide our licensed properties into four main categories: classic evergreen, movie release, current TV and current video game. We also license certain properties that fall outside of these four main categories.
  
• | Classic Evergreen. Properties in the classic evergreen category are based on movies, TV shows, video games, music, sports or other entertainment content that is not tied to a new or current release at the time we release the product. As a result, products that we design and sell based on these properties generally do not have a defined duration of market demand. Examples of our classic evergreen properties include Star Wars, Harry Potter, DC Comics, Marvel Comics and WWE.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Movie Release. Properties in the movie release category are tied to new movie releases and are intended to capitalize on the excitement of fans surrounding these releases. Products that we design and sell based on these properties are expected to have a limited duration of market demand, depending on the popularity of the movie release. Examples of our movie release properties include Star Wars Episode VIII, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Justice League, Spiderman: Homecoming and Thor: Ragnarok.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Current TV. Properties in the current TV category are tied to TV shows that are currently airing new content. These properties are expected to have a market demand depending on the popularity and longevity of the TV show, which is generally expected to be between three and seven years. Examples of our current TV properties currently include Stranger Things, Rick & Morty, Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead and Dragonball Z.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Current Video Game. Properties in the current video game category are tied to new video game releases that are intended to capitalize on the excitement of fans surrounding these releases. Products that we design and sell based on these properties are expected to have a market demand depending on the popularity and longevity of the video game, which is generally expected to be three to seven years. Examples of our current video game properties currently include Five Nights at Freddy’s, Overwatch and Kingdom Hearts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other. We also occasionally license properties that do not fit within the four categories described above, including those associated with current events and limited-duration pop culture phenomena, which we are able to capitalize on due to our speed to market and low cost of production. For example, in connection with the 2016 presidential election, we produced a line of Pop! branded and other figures featuring stylized versions of selected presidential candidates.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect these categories and the properties they encompass to evolve over time as current content becomes classic evergreen and as new forms of pop culture content emerge. In addition, while the percentage of sales attributable to our classic evergreen properties has been between approximately 42% and 49% over the past three years, it may fluctuate in any given year based on the number and popularity of new content releases.

Product Design and Development
 We believe our creative product designs and nimble speed to market are key reasons why content providers trust us with their properties and consumers passionately engage with our brands and products. We leverage our creative, art and sculpting teams to design and develop products in-house from inception to production. Our creative team layers our whimsical, fun and unique style onto the content we license to create product designs that resonate with consumers. Our creative team is passionate about pop culture, and we have a strong pipeline of talent given our culture and the opportunity we provide to work with the most relevant pop culture content. Our designers often work collaboratively with content providers in advance of new content releases to create unique, stylized products to maximize the value of their properties and, in some cases, the input we have provided has influenced the content provider’s creative choices for their original content.
 Our product development team oversees all aspects of new product development in order to ensure a timely product design and development process, including submitting the initial design to the content provider for approval, developing the product prototype, receiving final content provider approval and coordinating manufacturing with our third-party manufacturer. Our flexible and low-fixed cost production model enables us to move from product design of a figure to the store shelf in as few as 70 days and typically between 110 and 200 days, with a minimal upfront investment for most figures of $5,000 to $7,500 in tooling, molds and internal design costs. Because of the strength of our in-house creative team, we are able to move from product design to pre-selling a new product in as few as 24 hours. This ability, coupled with the valuable data insights we have developed over the past decade and the increasing use of repeated franchise properties by content providers, reduces potential product risk to us.
 Manufacturing and Materials 
 Our products are produced by third-party manufacturers primarily in China and Vietnam, which we choose on the basis of performance, capacity, capability and price. We also manufacture or assemble certain apparel and other products in the United States and Mexico. The use of third-party manufacturers enables us to avoid incurring fixed manufacturing costs, while maximizing flexibility, capacity and capability. Though our manufacturing base has diversified over time as we have grown our sales and expanded our product offerings, we have historically concentrated production with a small number of manufacturers and factories as part of a continuing effort to monitor quality, reduce manufacturing costs and ensure speed to market. In the case of most of the factories in which our products are manufactured, our products represent a significant percentage of each factory’s total capacity, which we believe provides us greater flexibility in supply chain management. We do not have long-term contracts with our manufacturers. We believe that alternative sources of supply are available to us although we cannot be assured that we can obtain adequate supplies of manufactured products on a timely basis or at all. 
 We base our production schedules for products on our internal forecasts, taking into account historical trends of similar products and properties, current market information and communications with customers. The accuracy of our forecasts is affected by consumer acceptance of our products, which is based on the strength of the underlying licensed property, the strength of competing products, the marketing strategies of retailers, changes in buying patterns of both our retail customers and our consumers, and overall economic conditions. Unexpected changes in these factors could result in a lack of product availability or excess inventory of a particular product.
 Although we do not conduct the day-to-day manufacturing of our products, we are responsible for designing both the product and the packaging. We seek to ensure quality control by actively reviewing the product, both in-house and via image at multiple stages in development and sample finished goods to validate the quality control process. In addition to quality control testing, safety testing of our products is done by independent third-party testing laboratories. 
 While we purchase finished products from our manufacturers, the cost of our products is impacted by the cost of labor, as well as the cost of the principal raw materials used in the production and sale of our products, including vinyl, fabric, ceramics and plastics. All of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price. Although we do not manufacture our products, we own most of the tools and molds used in the manufacturing process, and generally these are transferable among manufacturers if we choose to employ alternative manufacturers.

Sales
 We sell our products to a diverse network of customers throughout the world. Domestically, we sell our products to specialty retailers, mass-market retailers and e-commerce sites. Our key retail partners in the United States include Amazon, GameStop, Hot Topic, Target and Walmart. We also plan to target new or underdeveloped sales channels, including dollar, drug, grocery and convenience stores. Internationally, we sell our products directly to similar retailers, primarily in Europe, through our subsidiary Funko UK, Ltd. Our key international retail customers include Micromania, E.M.P. Merchandising and Smyths Toys.
 In addition to retailers, we also sell our products to distributors for sale to small retailers in the United States and in certain countries internationally, typically where we do not currently have a direct presence. We also sell certain of our products directly to consumers through our e-commerce business and, to a lesser extent, at specialty licensing and comic book shows, conventions and exhibitions in cities throughout the United States, including at Comic-Con events. Our direct-to-consumer sales accounted for approximately 6% of both our 2017 and 2016 net sales. Though our direct-to-consumer efforts have historically represented a small portion of our net sales, we intend to increase these efforts in the future.
 We believe we have a diverse customer base, with our top ten customers representing approximately 45%, 63%, 62% and 60% of our 2017, 2016, Successor 2015 Period and Predecessor 2015 Period sales, respectively. GameStop represented approximately 8%, 12%, 12% and 11% of our 2017, 2016, Successor 2015 Period and Predecessor 2015 Period sales, respectively. Additionally, Underground Toys Limited represented approximately 8%, 18% and 10% of our 2016, Successor 2015 Period and Predecessor 2015 Period sales, respectively, prior to our acquisition of Underground Toys Limited in January 2017 (the “Underground Toys Acquisition”). Hot Topic represented approximately 9%, 9%, 8% and 11% of our 2017, 2016, Successor 2015 Period and Predecessor 2015 Period sales, respectively. Other than GameStop, Underground Toys Limited and Hot Topic, no single customer represented more than 10% of our sales during the same periods.
 We maintain a full-time sales staff, many of whom make on-site visits to our customers for the purpose of showing products and soliciting orders. Many of our retail customers view us as experts in pop culture and, in some cases, we help manage their growing pop culture category within their stores, providing a curated experience by catering to their particular customer bases. For example, we can curate products based on Dr. Seuss and Harry Potter books for Barnes & Noble, and gaming-based products, such as Fallout and Overwatch, for GameStop. We believe this creates a mutually beneficial relationship between us and our retail customers by providing us with an opportunity to enhance the productivity of the pop culture category within their stores, which may also result in expanded shelf space for our products. In addition to our full-time sales staff, we also retain a number of independent sales representatives to sell and promote our products both domestically and internationally.
 We sell our products to our customers with payment terms typically varying from 30 to 90 days. As discussed above, we contract the manufacture of most of our products to third-party unaffiliated manufacturers primarily located in China, Vietnam and Mexico and ship those products to our warehouse facilities in the United States and the United Kingdom. While most of our sales originate in the United States and the United Kingdom from inventory we hold in our warehouses, certain of our customers may from time to time take title to our products upon shipment from the factory or at the port.
 We establish reserves for sales allowances, including promotional and other allowances, at the time of sale. The reserves are determined as a percentage of sales based upon either historical experience or upon estimates or programs agreed upon by our customers and us. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had reserves for sales allowances of $4.6 million and $4.5 million, respectively.
 Marketing
 The desire for people to connect with their favorite movies, TV shows, video games, music, sports and other passions is global. Because of this desire, which is fueled by the proliferation of online consumer access, we have experienced significant growth in brand penetration in recent years. We believe that our expansive retailer presence, industry-leading engagement rates across our owned channels, and devout fan base create unique opportunities to re-engage and remind consumers to purchase our products. 
 12
 
Funko has established a significant social media presence, using channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. We have continued to look for ways to provide our consumers with what we believe is industry-leading engagement through our variety of owned channels. In January 2018, our YouTube channel hosted its highest month ever with over 6 million minutes in viewing time. In November 2017, we acquired A Large Evil Corporation Ltd. (“A Large Evil Corporation Acquisition”) now renamed Funko Animation Studios, to produce proprietary online videos and other media content to showcase our products and globally-recognizable licenses. 
 We also engage with our consumers through online fan pages, including Funko Fanatics, which are run by our fans and our active blog. We intend to continue to expand our reach through different social media outlets, our websites and internet-based advertising.
 This deep connection with our consumers allows us to communicate quickly with a large number of fans and we believe will also help us grow our own e-commerce business. This deep connection with our consumers also creates a unique opportunity for established retailers to increase their own store traffic by featuring our products. We frequently co-market our products across the largest retailers, both online and in-store, including Amazon, Wal-Mart, Target and GameStop. Many of these retailers join with us to release exclusive products only available to fans at their locations. 
 In addition to our social media reach, our brand cultivates a strong and authentic core of users in part because of our commitment to interact directly with our fans at specialty licensing and comic book shows, conventions and exhibits, including Comic-Con events across the United States, many of which draw over 100,000 attendees.
In August 2017, we opened a flagship retail store location at our headquarters in Everett, Washington. We opened this one-of-a-kind location to showcase our products and brands, to demonstrate retail merchandising for our retail customers, and to serve as a unique destination and experience for our fans of all ages.
 Competition
 We are a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and marketing of licensed pop culture products, in a highly competitive industry. We compete with toy companies in many of our product categories, some of which have substantially more resources than us, stronger name recognition, longer operating histories and benefit from greater economies of scale. We also increasingly compete with large toy companies for shelf space at leading mass market and other retailers. We also compete with numerous smaller domestic and foreign collectible product designers and manufacturers in each of our product categories. Our competitive advantage is based primarily on the creativity and quality of the design of our products and their perceived value, our price points, our license portfolio and our ability to bring new products to market quickly.
 We produce most of our products under trademarks and copyrights that we own, utilizing the intellectual property of our licensors. Certain of our licensors have reserved the rights to manufacture, distribute and sell identical or similar products. Some of these products could directly compete with our products and could be sold to our customers or directly to consumers at lower prices than those at which our products are sold.
 Although we believe we have one of the largest portfolios of licensed content in the pop culture industry, with strong relationships with many of our licensors, we must vigorously compete to obtain these licenses from leading content providers on commercially reasonable terms, and to expand our license rights into additional licensed product categories. This competition is based primarily on the creativity of our product designs, our ability to bring new products to market quickly, our ability to increase fan engagement, the breadth of our sales channels and the quality of our products. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
 Intellectual Property 
 We believe that our trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights have significant value and are important to the marketing of our brand and the favorable perception of our products. As of December 31, 2017, we owned approximately 34 registered U.S. trademarks, 105 registered international trademarks, 12 pending U.S. trademark applications and 21 pending international trademark applications. Most of our products are produced and sold under trademarks owned by or licensed to us. We register many of our trademarks related to our brands and seek protection under the trademark and copyright laws of the United States and other countries where our 
 13
 
products are produced or sold. These intellectual property rights can be significant assets. Accordingly, while we believe we are sufficiently protected, the failure to obtain or the loss of some of these rights could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
 Government Regulation
 Our products sold in the United States are subject to the provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act (“CPSA”), the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (“FHSA”), the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (“CPSIA”) and the Flammable Fabrics Act (“FFA”), and the regulations promulgated pursuant to such statutes. These statutes and the related regulations ban from the market any consumer products that fail to comply with applicable product safety laws, regulations, and standards. The Consumer Product Safety Commission may require the recall, repurchase, replacement, or repair of any such banned products or products that otherwise create a substantial risk of injury and may seek penalties for regulatory noncompliance under certain circumstances. Similar laws exist in some U.S. states and our products sold worldwide are subject to the provisions of similar laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, including Canada, Australia, Europe and Asia.
 We maintain a quality control program to help ensure compliance with applicable product safety requirements. We use independent third-party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the CPSA, the FHSA, the CPSIA, the FFA, other applicable domestic and international product standards, as well as our own standards and those of some of our larger retail customers and licensors. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free, and we may in the future experience issues in products that result in recalls, withdrawals, or replacements of products. A product recall could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, depending on the product affected by the recall and the extent of the recall efforts required. A product recall could also negatively affect our reputation and the sales of other Funko products. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
 We are subject to various other federal, state, local and international laws and regulations applicable to our business, including export controls, and have established processes for compliance with these laws and regulations.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed 586 full-time employees and two part-time employees. We employed 429 people in the United States and 159 people in Europe. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
Seasonality
 While our customers in the retail industry typically operate in highly seasonal businesses, we have historically experienced only moderate seasonality in our business. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 60.5%, 58.7% and 64.6%, respectively, of our net sales were made in the third and fourth quarters, as our customers build up their inventories in anticipation of the holiday season. Generally, the first quarter of the year represents the lowest volume of shipments and sales in our business and in the retail and toy industries generally, and it is also the least profitable quarter due to the various fixed costs of the business. However, the rapid growth we have experienced in recent years may have masked the full effects of seasonal factors on our business to date, and as such, seasonality may have a greater effect on our results of operations in future periods. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
