ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General 
 Sunesis Pharmaceutical, Inc. (“Sunesis” or the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Our primary activities since incorporation have been conducting research and development internally and through corporate collaborators, in-licensing and out-licensing pharmaceutical compounds and technology, conducting clinical trials, and raising capital.
 Our lead program is vecabrutinib, formerly known as SNS-062, a non-covalent inhibitor of Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (“BTK”). Vecabrutinib is being studied in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in B-cell malignancies. In December 2013, we acquired global commercial rights to vecabrutinib, an orally available compound, from Biogen Idec MA, Inc. (“Biogen”). In January 2017, we announced our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for vecabrutinib had become effective. In July 2017, we announced the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1b/2 study to assess the safety and activity in patients with advanced B-cell malignancies after two or more prior therapies, including ibrutinib or another covalent BTK inhibitor, and including patients with BTK C481 mutations. In connection to the dosing of the first patient, we also made a milestone payment of $2.5 million to Biogen under the licensing agreement. The Phase 1b portion of the study is a dose escalation component that will proceed to define a maximum tolerated dose and/or a recommended Phase 2 dose. We currently expect to announce a recommended Phase 2 dose in the fall of 2018. Upon identifying the Phase 2 dose, the Phase 2 portion will further explore clinical activity and safety in disease- and mutation-specific cohorts, including patients with and without the C481S mutation.
 We are also developing SNS-510, a PDK1 inhibitor licensed from Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”). We acquired from Takeda global commercial rights to several potential first-in class, preclinical inhibitors of the novel target PDK1, including SNS-510. We are currently characterizing SNS-510 in preclinical studies with the goal of filing an IND in 2019. 
 We are in a collaboration with Takeda for the development of TAK-580 (formerly MLN2480), an oral pan-RAF inhibitor, which is under investigation for pediatric low-grade glioma and other solid tumor cancers.

We are also seeking to identify a partner to support further vosaroxin development. We conducted a Phase 3, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (“AML”). This trial did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. As a result of both U.S. and European regulatory interactions, we announced on May 1, 2017 the withdrawal of our Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) for vosaroxin. We believe that one additional successful pivotal trial could support future marketing approvals of vosaroxin in the U.S and Europe. It is our intention to out-license vosaroxin to a partner to continue development and commercialization for vosaroxin. In the meantime, we continue to support limited investigator-sponsored trials with vosaroxin.
 Our Strategy 
 We plan to continue to build Sunesis into a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new oncology therapeutics by: 
  
• | exploring the safety and efficacy of vecabrutinib as a potential treatment for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (“CLL”) patients who have relapsed while being treated with a covalent BTK inhibitor primarily as a result of the C481S mutation, as well as for other B-cell malignancies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | investing in preclinical development of SNS-510, with the goal of filing an IND in 2019;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | supporting our pan-RAF kinase inhibitor program with Takeda;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | continuing to expand and develop our oncology-focused pipeline through further licensing or collaboration arrangements and research and development; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | seeking to identify a partner to out-license vosaroxin.

Development Pipeline 
 The following chart summarizes our development pipeline: 
 
Vecabrutinib (SNS-062) 

 Vecabrutinib is a non-covalently binding inhibitor of BTK. BTK mediates signaling through the B-cell receptor, and is critical for adhesion, migration, proliferation and survival of normal and malignant B-lineage lymphoid cells. BTK has been well validated as a target for treatment of B-cell malignancies, with the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib approved for relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma, newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory CLL, CLL with 17p depletion, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, and marginal zone lymphoma.  Ibrutinib is covalent and forms an irreversible bond with cysteine residue 481 (C481) in the BTK kinase domain.  This cysteine may mutate over time to a serine (“C481S”) and this is associated with disease progression and resistance to further treatment with ibrutinib and other covalent BTK inhibitors. Resistance to ibrutinib is a growing problem, with an estimate of cumulative incidence of disease progression in a largely relapsed/refractory CLL population of 19% at 4 years. Characterization of the ibruntinib-relapsed population continues, with one investigation reporting that mutations in BTK C481 are present in 2/3 of relapsed patients, suggesting that this presents a large, growing, and well-defined market.
 Vecabrutinib has inhibitory activity in vitro in BTK kinase assays and in B-cell signaling assays, as well as in in vivo models of B-cell mediated diseases. The mechanism by which vecabrutinib inhibits BTK is distinguished from the mechanism of ibrutinib, as vecabrutinib binds BTK non-covalently, and does not interact with BTK C481. In addition, vecabrutinib has a unique kinase selectivity profile and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile compared to covalently binding BTK inhibitors and this may translate to clinical benefit for patients. For example, vecabrutinib inhibits interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), which may improve anti-
 5


tumor T-cell activity. Ibrutinib also inhibits ITK, and this is thought to have contributed to its efficacy in chronic Graft-Versus-Host disease. Unlike ibrutinib, vecabrutinib does not inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and EGFR inhibition has been associated with gastrointestinal and other adverse events. Vecabrutinib’s distinct kinase selectivity profile and favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile, demonstrated in our Phase 1a study, indicate the potential for vecabrutinib to become a differentiated treatment for B-cell malignancies.
 In 2015, we conducted IND-enabling studies for vecabrutinib, and in 2016 we conducted a Phase 1a healthy volunteer study in Belgium. The results of this study supported further development of vecabrutinib.  In December 2016, we filed an IND with the FDA and in January 2017, the IND was cleared to proceed by the FDA. The rights to develop vecabrutinib for oncology indications were in-licensed from Biogen in December 2013, as described below. 
 Vecabrutinib is currently in a Phase 1b dose escalation study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity over a range of dose levels in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL and other B-cell malignancies after at least two lines of standard treatment to determine the maximum tolerated and/or recommended phase 2 dose. We recently amended the protocol to broaden the inclusion criteria to include additional B-cell malignancies such as Follicular Lymphoma and certain types of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma. In addition to existing leading clinical sites Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Weill Cornell Medicine, UC Irvine, and MD Anderson Cancer Center, Swedish Cancer Institute recently joined the study as our first community-based investigational site bringing a broad catchment area and long history of ibrutinib use. 
 In December 2017 at an investor and analyst event at the American Society of Hematology meeting, we presented data from the first cohort, patients treated with 25mg twice daily (“BID”) of vecabrutinib. Vecabrutinib was well tolerated and patients remained on study for 2-4 cycles of treatment. Adverse events included headache and back pain, cytopenias, and infection. Significant BTK phosphorylation inhibition was observed in two of the patients, a promising early sign of pharmacodynamic activity. We are currently studying the 50mg BID dose cohort, which must be expanded to six patients because one patient did not receive the required number of doses due to an adverse event, which is, by protocol, a dose-limiting toxicity.
 TAK-580 (formerly MLN2480) 
 A pan-Raf inhibitor program was originally developed through a collaboration agreement between Sunesis and Biogen. In March 2011, Biogen’s rights to this program were purchased by and exclusively licensed to Takeda. In September 2017, Takeda presented the final results from a Phase 1 study of TAK-580 in 99 patients at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) conference. The safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of TAK-580 dosed every other day and once weekly at maximum tolerated doses were acceptable. Once-weekly dosing improved safety over every-other-day dosing. These data support the further assessment of once-weekly dosing. The once-weekly dosing schedule is currently being assessed in rational drug combinations to target tumor indications where dysregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is present. 
 In February 2018, an investigator-sponsored trial was initiated evaluating TAK-580 in Pediatric Low-Grade Glioma (PLGG), for which we believe the scientific rationale is compelling.  PLGG accounts for nearly 30% of pediatric brain cancer, and Fusion-RAF proteins are present in a large proportion of these pediatric tumors. There is a significant unmet need for these children and we expect to have a more detailed update on this trial in the coming months.
 The Raf kinases (A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf) are key regulators of cell proliferation and survival within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Pan-RAF inhibitors such as TAK-580 are able to regulate MAP kinase pathway activation that are driven by RAF-monomer signaling, such as BRAF V600 mutations, and are uniquely positioned to also inhibit RAF dimer signaling, which can drive cancers with RAS mutations, non-V600 BRAF mutations, and RAF fusions.
 Under the license agreement, we may in the future receive up to $57.5 million in pre-commercialization, event-based payments related to the development by Takeda of the first two indications for each of the licensed products directed against the Raf target, and royalty payments depending on related product sales, as further described below. 
 SNS-510
 SNS-510 is in preclinical studies with the goal of submitting an IND in 2019. 
 In January 2014, we in-licensed a series of selective PDK1 inhibitors from Takeda that were discovered under a research collaboration agreement between Biogen and Sunesis, as described below. PDK1 is a key kinase and mediator of PI3K/AKT signaling and also regulates other pathways by PI3K-independent mechanisms. These pathways are involved in cell growth, differentiation, 
 6


survival and migration and are frequently dysregulated in cancers. PDK1 inhibitors are expected to be broadly active in both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. We have taken a series of PDK1 inhibitors with confirmed antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo into preclinical development, and in 2017, we selected SNS-510 as a development candidate. 
 There are multiple PI3K pathway inhibitors in late stage development or approval for use in CLL and other malignancies. PDK1 represents a key oncology target within the PI3K pathway and other PI3K-independent pathways including MAPK and NF-KB. We believe SNS-510 is a potential first-in-class compound with demonstrated inhibition of PI3K-dependent and independent pathways and a compelling in vitro and in vivo profile. SNS-510 has the potential for broad-spectrum single agent and combination activity in both solid tumor and hematologic malignancies. 
 Inhibitors of PDK1 are expected to be able to provide similar clinical benefits to those observed with PI3K inhibitors and have the potential to provide additional benefits through inhibition of PI3K-independent cancer signaling pathways, especially in cancer types in which PDK1 is overexpressed such as breast cancer and AML. We believe that our PDK1 inhibitors can be differentiated from PI3K and PDK1 inhibitors currently approved and in development and may provide novel opportunities in solid tumor and hematologic cancers. 
 Vosaroxin
 We are seeking to identify a partner with the expertise and resources to support further vosaroxin development. After regulatory consultation in the US and Europe, we believe that one successful Phase 3 trial would be sufficient for approval, unlocking value for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and investors. We believe the best next step would be to study vosaroxin in a Phase 3 study in relapsed or refractory AML patients who are over 60 years old.
 Vosaroxin is an anti-cancer quinolone derivative—a class of compounds that has not been used previously for the treatment of cancer. Preclinical data demonstrate that vosaroxin intercalates DNA and inhibits topoisomerase II, an enzyme critical for cell replication, resulting in replication-dependent, site-selective DNA damage, G2 arrest and apoptosis. We licensed worldwide development and commercialization rights to vosaroxin from Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. (“Sumitomo”) in 2003. In October 2014, we announced results from our Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal clinical trial of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine to evaluate overall survival in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. The trial enrolled 711 adult patients at 124 study sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Patients treated with vosaroxin achieved increased overall survival compared to those treated with placebo (7.5 months vs 6.1 months, HR=0.87), the primary endpoint, but this difference did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.06). The complete remission (CR) rate, the sole secondary efficacy endpoint in the trial, did demonstrate a significant difference for the vosaroxin combination arm (30.1% vs 16.3%, p < 0.0001). Regarding drug safety, Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic adverse events that were more common in the vosaroxin combination arm were gastrointestinal and infection-related toxicities, consistent with those observed in our previous clinical trials. The rate of serious adverse events was 55.5% in the vosaroxin combination arm compared to 35.7% in the placebo and cytarabine arm.
 Based upon the results, in November 2014, we submitted a letter of intent to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) describing our intention to file a marketing authorization application (MAA) for vosaroxin plus cytarabine for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. In June 2015, we met separately with the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur, who are two appointed members of the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Based upon feedback from these meetings, we filed an MAA with the EMA at the end of 2015. In March 2017, we submitted responses to the EMA Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues issued by the CHMP as part of the centralized review process of the MAA for vosaroxin as a treatment for relapsed/refractory AML in patients aged 60 years and older.  In April 2017, we presented to the Scientific Advisory Group – Oncology (SAG-O) and also to the CHMP.  As a result of these interactions, feedback from our CHMP rapporteurs and our retained regulatory consultants, and an internal assessment, we announced on May 1, 2017 the withdrawal of our MAA. It is our intention to continue to support investigator-sponsored group trials with vosaroxin and to find an out-license partner prior to starting a registered trial.
 The molecular core of vosaroxin is structurally similar to quinolones and distinct from anthracyclines and anthracenediones. Vosaroxin's anticancer activity results from apoptosis caused exclusively by DNA intercalation, inhibition of topoisomerase II, and cell cycle inhibition in replicating cells. Vosaroxin’s cytotoxic activity is established in diverse human tumors and clinical activity is observed in both solid and hematologic malignancies. In preclinical studies, vosaroxin demonstrated broad antitumor activity and exhibited additive or synergistic activity when combined with several therapeutic agents currently used in the treatment of cancer, including cytarabine. Vosaroxin maintains activity in drug resistant tumor cell lines and human tumor models. Vosaroxin evades P-gp transporter-mediated resistance, and its activity is p53 independent, reducing resistance to therapy. Vosaroxin has demonstrated anticancer activity in patients who have failed other topoisomerase II inhibitor treatment.

Vosaroxin Investigator Sponsored Clinical Trials 
 At the request of investigators, we have agreed to support select investigator-sponsored trials. These trials maintain interest in vosaroxin, make the product available to some patients through clinical trials, and could support an expanded market opportunity beyond relapsed/refractory AML. We believe these trials will help to out-license vosaroxin and ultimately enhance its value. These investigator-sponsored trials include:

• | Phase 2 trial of vosaroxin with decitabine in patients 60 years of age or order with newly diagnosed acute AML or high-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). The trial was conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center under the direction of Naval G. Daver, M.D., Associate Professor and Farhad Ravandi -Kashani, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine. The trial completed with overall response rate of 74% and improved overall median overall survival from 5.5 months to 14.6 months.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 1/2 trial of vosaroxin in combination with azacitidine in patients with MDS. The trial was conducted at the Washington University School of Medicine under the direction of Meagan A. Jacoby, M.D., Ph.D., Instructor of Medicine, Division of Oncology. The trial completed with overall response rate of 63% with 50% of patients receiving transplant.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 trial of vosaroxin and infusional cytarabine for frontline treatment of AML (VITAL) patients. Stage 1 of the trial completed with 53% complete remission rate and overall response rate of 71%. Stage 2 is fully enrolled with EHA 2018 presentation targeted.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 1/2 trial of vosaroxin in adult patients with previously treated intermediate-2 or high-risk MDS. The trial is being conducted at Weill Cornell Medical College and New York-Presbyterian Hospital under the direction of Gail J. Roboz, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of the Leukemia Program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 1/2 trial of vosaroxin with cytarabine tested as consolidation therapy as one of up to three novel agents. This trial is being conducted under the direction of national cooperative group French Innovative Leukemia Organization (FILO) and the Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA).

License, Collaboration and Royalty Agreements 
 Licensing and Collaboration Agreements with Biogen and Takeda 
 Overview 
 In August 2004, we entered into the original collaboration agreement with Biogen (the “Biogen OCA”) to discover, develop and commercialize small molecule inhibitors of the human protein Raf kinase, including family members Raf-1, A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf, (collectively “Raf”), and up to five additional targets that play a role in oncology and immunology indications such as BTK and PDK1. 
 In June 2008, the parties agreed to terminate the research term and related funding. In March 2011, as part of a series of agreements among Sunesis, Biogen and Takeda, we entered into: (a) an amended and restated collaboration agreement with Biogen (“the Biogen Idec 1st ARCA”); (b) a license agreement with Millennium (“the Takeda Agreement”); and (c) a termination and transition agreement among Sunesis, Biogen and Takeda (“the Termination and Transition Agreement”). 
 The Termination and Transition Agreement provided for the termination of Biogen’s exclusive rights under the Biogen OCA to all discovery programs under such agreement other than for small molecule inhibitors of the human protein BTK and the permitted assignment to Takeda of all related Sunesis collaboration assets and rights to Raf kinase and the human protein PDK1. 
 Biogen  
 The Biogen 1st ARCA amended and restated the Biogen OCA, to provide for the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule BTK inhibitors. Under this agreement, we no longer have research obligations, but licenses granted to Biogen with respect to the research collaboration under the Biogen OCA (other than the licenses transferred to Takeda under the Takeda Agreement) remain in effect. 
 In December 2013, we entered into a second amended and restated collaboration agreement with Biogen (the “Biogen 2nd ARCA”), which amended and restated the Biogen 1st ARCA, to provide us with an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize vecabrutinib, a BTK inhibitor synthesized under the Biogen 1st ARCA, solely for oncology indications. During the third quarter of 2017, we made a milestone payment of $2.5 million to Biogen upon the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1b/2 study to assess the safety and activity of vecabrutinib in patients with advanced B-cell malignancies after two or more prior therapies, including ibrutinib or other covalent BTK inhibitors, and including patients with BTK C481 mutations. We 
 8


may also be required to make royalty payments on product sales of vecabrutinib. Additionally, potential future royalty payments to us were reduced to equal those amounts due to Biogen for potential future sales of vecabrutinib. All of our other rights contained in the Biogen 1st ARCA remain unchanged. 
 Takeda 
 Under the Takeda Agreement, we granted exclusive licenses to products against two oncology targets originally developed under the Biogen OCA, Raf and PDK1, under substantially the same terms as under the Biogen OCA. 
 In January 2014, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Takeda (“the Amended Takeda Agreement”), to provide us with an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize preclinical inhibitors of PDK1. In connection with execution of the Amended Takeda Agreement, we paid an upfront fee and may in the future be required to make up to $9.2 million in pre-commercialization milestone payments depending on our development of PDK1 inhibitors and royalty payments depending on related product sales. 
 With respect to the Raf target product rights that were originally licensed to Takeda under the Takeda Agreement, we may in the future receive up to $57.5 million in pre-commercialization, event-based payments related to the development by Takeda of the first two indications for each of the licensed products directed against the Raf target and royalty payments depending on related product sales. The agreement also provides us with future co-development and co-promotion rights. Takeda is currently conducting a Phase 1b clinical study of an oral investigative drug, TAK-580, which is licensed to them under the Amended Takeda Agreement. 
 In-license Agreement with Sumitomo 
 In October 2003, we entered into an agreement with Sumitomo to acquire exclusive worldwide development and marketing rights for vosaroxin. In the future we may be required to make additional milestone payments of up to $6.5 million in aggregate to Sumitomo for (a) filing New Drug Applications (“NDA”), in the U.S. and Japan, and (b) for receiving regulatory approvals in these regions and the EU, for cancer-related indications. If vosaroxin is approved for a non-cancer indication, an additional milestone payment will become payable to Sumitomo. 
 The agreement also provides for royalty payments to Sumitomo at rates based on total annual net sales. Under the agreement, we may reduce our royalty payments to Sumitomo if a third party markets a competitive product and we must pay royalties for third-party intellectual property rights necessary to commercialize vosaroxin. Royalty obligations under the agreement continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of the date on which no valid patent claims relating to a product exist or 10 years from the date of the first sale of the product. 
 If we discontinue seeking regulatory approval and/or the sale of the product in a region, we are required to return our rights to the product in that region to Sumitomo. The agreement may be terminated by either party for the other party’s uncured breach or bankruptcy. 
 Royalty Agreement with RPI 
 In March 2012, we entered into a Revenue Participation Agreement (the “Royalty Agreement”), with RPI Finance Trust (“RPI”), an entity related to Royalty Pharma. In September 2012, as a result of the recommendation by the VALOR trial Data and Safety Monitoring Board to increase the sample size for the VALOR trial, RPI made a $25.0 million cash payment to us in exchange for a 6.75% royalty on any future net sales of vosaroxin. In conjunction with the Royalty Agreement, we issued two five-year warrants to RPI, each to purchase 166,666 shares of our common stock, at exercise prices of $20.88 and $27.84 per share, respectively. Of the $25.0 million, $21.9 million was recorded as deferred revenue and is being amortized to revenue over the related performance period of the Royalty Agreement. The remaining $3.1 million represents the fair value of the warrants. Both warrants were exercised in full in 2014.
 Revenues 
 Over the past years, we have generated revenue through the Royalty Agreement with RPI and the Biogen 1st ARCA. In 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recognized $0.7 million, $2.4 million, and $2.9 million of revenue, respectively, related to the Royalty Agreement with RPI.

Manufacturing 
 We rely on, and we expect to continue to rely on, a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of all of our active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”), including vecabrutinib and vosaroxin and the finished drug products (“FDP”) incorporating the API. We have supply agreements with all of these third parties, and our agreements with these parties may include provisions that allow for termination at will by either party following a relatively short notice period. 
 We currently rely on two contract manufacturers for vecabrutinib API and two for FDP. Third-party contract manufacturing organizations are relied on to manufacture key starting materials and intermediates required in the manufacture of vecabrutinib API.  The manufacturing requires high-purity materials to meet the final product specifications. A number of suitable manufacturers are available in North America and India for the manufacturing of API and FDP. Three lots of API have been manufactured at a clinical scale. Scale-up to commercial scale has not been done. The cost to manufacture at large scale is unknown.
 We currently rely on a single contract manufacturer for the vosaroxin API and a single contract manufacturer to formulate the vosaroxin API and fill and finish vials of the vosaroxin FDP. Because the vosaroxin API is classified as a cytotoxic substance, the number of available manufacturers for the API and FDP is limited, but we have identified several suitable backup facilities. In 2016, we performed process validation studies on API and FDP batches of vosaroxin. The results of these process validation studies met preset criteria. In 2017, we manufactured one lot of commercial-scale vosaroxin finished product.
 Competition 
 The life sciences industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from many pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are researching, developing and marketing products designed to address the treatment of cancer, including B-cell malignancies and AML. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and drug development resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive experience in the clinical testing of, obtaining regulatory approvals for, and marketing drugs. 
 With respect to vecabrutinib, we are aware of a number of companies that are or may be pursuing different approaches to C481S-mutant BTK inhibition, including Aptose Biosciences Inc., Roche Holdings AG, ArQule, Inc., and Loxo Oncology, Inc. Moreover, numerous companies are also pursuing inhibitors of wild-type BTK, including AbbVie Inc. (“AbbVie”), with its drug IMBRUVICA®. Other companies with BTK inhibitors currently in development include AstraZeneca PLC, BeiGene, Ltd., EMD Merck, Eli Lilly and Company, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”), Principia Biopharm Inc., and others in oncology and non-oncology indications. Other drugs that may compete to treat ibrutinib refractory patients, including patients with C481S-mutant BTK, include AbbVie’s Bcl-2 inhibitor VENCLEXTA™, Gilead’s Zydelig PI2K kinase inhibitor, TG Therapeutics, Inc.’ umbralisib PI3K inhibitors, and Verastem’s duvelisib PI3K inhibitor.
 Intellectual Property 
 We believe that patent protection is very important to our business and that our future success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents protecting vecabrutinib, SNS-510, TAK-580, vosaroxin or future drug candidates, if any. Historically, we have patented a wide range of technology, inventions and improvements related to our business. When appropriate, we seek orphan drug status and/or data exclusivity in the United States and their equivalents in other relevant jurisdictions, to the maximum extent that the respective laws will permit at such time. For example, we secured orphan drug designation for vosaroxin for the treatment of AML from the European Commission and from the FDA. This may provide ten years of marketing exclusivity in all member countries of the European Union, and seven years of market exclusivity in the U.S.

In addition to our U.S. and European patents, we have been granted similar and related patents in certain other countries, and patent applications are pending in these and other countries, including major markets, throughout the world. As of December 31, 2017, we own, co-own or have rights to approximately 200 granted U.S. and foreign patents, and approximately 106 pending U.S. and foreign applications, pertaining to vosaroxin and compositions and uses thereof. The expiries of these granted patents and patents that may be granted range from 2025 to 2030.
General
 While it is possible that patent term restoration and/or supplemental patent certificates could be available for some of these or other patents we own or control through licenses after possible approval of commercial product, we cannot guarantee that such additional protection will be obtained, and the expiration dates described here do not include such term restoration.
 Our commercial success depends on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our ability to conduct our business. The existence of third party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of patents owned by or licensed to us and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection. If patents containing competitive or conflicting claims are issued to third parties and these claims are ultimately determined to be valid, we may be enjoined from pursuing research, development or commercialization of vecabrutinib, SNS-510, TAK-580, vosaroxin or future drug candidates, if any, or be required to obtain licenses to such patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology. 
 We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially in situations or jurisdictions in which we believe patent protection may not be appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to maintain and do not protect technology against independent developments made by third parties. We seek to protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisers to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials. We seek to protect our company name and the names of our products and technologies by obtaining trademark registrations, as well as common law rights in trademarks and service marks, in the United States and in other countries. 
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs. These agencies and other federal, state and local and foreign entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our product candidates and any future drug candidates we may develop, if any. The application of these regulatory frameworks to the development, approval and commercialization of our drug candidates will take a number of years to accomplish, if at all, and involve the expenditure of substantial resources. 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before any of our drug candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, in vivo preclinical studies and formulation studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an NDA to the FDA;
--+---------------------------------

 11


 
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product candidate is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including proposed labeling (package insert information) and promotional materials, prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Preclinical Testing and INDs 
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals. Laboratories that comply with the FDA Good Laboratory Practice regulations must conduct preclinical safety tests. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND application to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. 
 Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Protection of Human Subjects regulations and Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND application. 
 In addition, each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), at each institution where the study will be conducted. Each IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The FDA, an IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements and regulations for informed consent. 
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap, sometimes followed by a fourth phase: 
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the drug candidate for safety (adverse effects), dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients. In some cases, particularly in cancer trials, a sponsor may decide to conduct what is referred to as a “Phase 1b” evaluation, which is a safety-focused, multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial, often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. In some cases, a sponsor may decide to conduct what is referred to as a “Phase 2b” evaluation, which is a second, confirmatory Phase 2 clinical trial that could, if positive and accepted by the FDA, serve as a pivotal clinical trial in the approval of a drug candidate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as pivotal trials. When Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a drug candidate has potential activity in a disease or condition and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4 (post-marketing) clinical trials may be required by the FDA in some cases. The FDA may conditionally approve an NDA for a drug candidate on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and/or efficacy after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.

New Drug Applications 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application fee under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees, which are typically increased annually. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most such applications for non-priority products within 10 months of filing, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. 
 After the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMs, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 The United States Orphan Drug Act promotes the development of products that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Upon receipt of orphan drug designation from the FDA, the sponsor is eligible for tax credits for qualified clinical trial expenses, the ability to apply for annual grant funding, waiver of PDUFA application fee, and upon approval, the potential for seven years of market exclusivity for the orphan-designated product for the orphan-designated indication. On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted into law and the Orphan Drug tax credit was reduced from 50% to 25%. In October 2009, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to vosaroxin for treatment of AML. 
 13


In the European Union, orphan status is available for therapies addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 people, and provides for the potential for 10 years of marketing exclusivity in Europe for the orphan-designated product for the orphan-designated indication. The marketing exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In April 2012, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation to vosaroxin for the treatment of AML.
 Other Regulatory Requirements 
 Any drugs manufactured or distributed by us, Biogen, Takeda, or our potential future licensees or collaboration partners, if any, pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. 
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, including cancer therapy. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
 Healthcare Law and Regulation
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws restrict our business activities, including certain marketing practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
 The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for either the referral of an individual, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. 
 Federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. 
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of 
 14


the payor. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens.
 Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to a wide range of sanctions and penalties, potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, integrity obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under these laws or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending any such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance and disrupt our business operations.
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of or our drug candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 
 Under European Union regulatory systems, permission to conduct clinical research is granted by the Competent Authority of each European Member State (“MS”), and the applicable Ethics Committees (“EC”), through the submission of a Clinical Trial Application. An EC in the European Union serves the same function as an IRB in the United States. The review times vary by MS but may not exceed 60 days. The EC has a maximum of 60 days to give its opinion on the acceptability of the Clinical Trial Application to both the governing MS and the sponsor applicant. If the application is deemed acceptable, the MS informs the applicant (or does not within the 60-day window inform the applicant of non-acceptance) and we may proceed with the clinical trial. 
 To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we must submit an MAA under the centralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization from the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the CHMP of the EMA that is valid in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), which includes all European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP.
 In the EEA, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. A European Union orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”), agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (“PDCO”). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult 
 15


populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once a marketing authorization is obtained for a pediatric indication in all Member States of the European Union and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension. For orphan-designated medicinal products, the 10-year period of market exclusivity is extended to 12 years.
 In addition to regulations in the United States and the European Union, we will be subject to a variety of other foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our product candidates. Our ability to sell drugs will also depend on the availability of reimbursement from government and private insurance companies. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 We incurred $21.5 million, $22.9 million and $23.7 million of research and development expenses in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily related to the development of vosaroxin and vecabrutinib. We expect to continue to incur significant development expenses related to the development of vecabrutinib, vosaroxin, and our other drug candidates. 
Environment 
 We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures for environmental compliance and protection. We do not expect that such expenditures will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or results of operations in the foreseeable future. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, our workforce consisted of 34 full-time equivalent employees, of which 20 are engaged in research and development and 14 are engaged in general and administrative, medical affairs and commercial planning functions. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
