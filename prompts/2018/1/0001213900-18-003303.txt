Background of Presentation and Recent Developments
 
Name Change
 
Effective March 12, 2018, we changed our name from “Snap Interactive, Inc.” to “PeerStream, Inc.” In connection with the name change, we also changed our trading symbol on the OTCQB Marketplace from “STVI” to “PEER.” The new brand is intended to honor the Company’s legacy of empowering consumers to meet new people and connect with peers via social video applications, while also referencing the anticipated importance of peer-to-peer networks and multimedia streaming in the Company’s future.
 
AVM Merger
 
On October 7, 2016, we completed the AVM Merger, pursuant to which SAVM Acquisition Corporation, our wholly owned subsidiary, merged with and into AVM, with AVM surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the AVM Merger, the former shareholders of AVM received shares of our common stock representing approximately 77.9% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the post-AVM Merger combined company, and the Company’s former shareholders retained approximately 22.1% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the post-AVM Merger combined company, in each case including unvested shares of restricted stock in the total number of shares of common stock outstanding.
 
Presentation for Reverse Stock Split 
 
On January 5, 2017, we effected a 1-for-35 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each issued and outstanding share of our common stock, and the per share exercise price of and number of shares of our common stock underlying our outstanding stock options, was automatically proportionally adjusted based on the 1-for-35 Reverse Stock Split ratio. Except as otherwise provided herein, all share and per-share amounts of our common stock and stock options have been adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented. The Reverse Stock Split did not alter the par value of our common stock, which remains at $0.001 per share, modify any voting rights or other terms of our common stock or impact the amount of preferred stock we are authorized to issue.
Terminated LiveXLive Merger Agreement
 
On September 6, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with LiveXLive Media, Inc. (“LiveXLive”), LXL Video Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of LiveXLive (“Merger Sub”), and Jason Katz, as the agent of the stockholders of the Company, pursuant to which we would have merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of LiveXLive (the “LiveXLive Merger Agreement”).
 
On October 31, 2017, we terminated the LiveXLive Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2(a) of the LiveXLive Merger Agreement due to certain conditions of the LiveXLive Merger Agreement not having been fulfilled as of October 27, 2017, which relieved us of all of our obligations under the LiveXLive Merger Agreement. No termination fee was payable by the Company in connection with the termination of the LiveXLive Merger Agreement.
 
Company Overview
 
We are a leading developer of innovative decentralized technologies that power multimedia social applications and business communication solutions worldwide. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2005. Our principal executive office is located at 122 East 42nd Street, Suite 2600, New York, New York 10168.
 
Our product portfolio includes Paltalk and Camfrog, which together host one of the world's largest collections of video-based communities, and FirstMet, a prominent interactive dating brand serving users 35 and older. Our other products include Tinychat, Firetalk, 50More, Ribbit Live, The Grade, and Vumber. We recently announced a number of initiatives that feature enhancements of our technology platform using blockchain and plans to offer aspects of our multimedia streaming and communications technology to third party developers and corporate clients. We are also currently developing a new video-enabled secure messaging service built on blockchain technology called Backchannel that we expect to launch in the fourth quarter of 2018.
 
Our leading network of products creates a unique social media enterprise where users can meet, see, chat, broadcast and message in real time with other users in our network. Our properties are generally available through Windows®, MacTM OS, iOSTM and AndroidTM platforms. The proprietary technology underlying our products allows us to operate thousands of simultaneous streams, including on mobile platforms, that support interactions on a one-on-one, one-to-many and many-to-many basis. We also have a worldwide established presence and brand identity in both live video chat and interactive dating, with users in over 180 countries as of March 16, 2018. Furthermore, our technology is supported by a portfolio of 26 issued patents.
 
We believe that live video is in the early stages of adoption for applications related to meeting, chatting, dating, broadcasting and other interactive purposes and over time presents an attractive growth opportunity as it becomes pervasively integrated across the social networking and interactive communications industries. As individuals become more reliant on communicating through applications, we believe it is becoming increasingly more important to users that we provide a secure and private environment on which to interact via live video online.

In 2018, we plan to pursue a strategy of using blockchain technology to improve our existing technology platform, to build new proprietary applications and to offer technology solutions to third parties, in each case taking advantage of the enhanced security, scalability and cost-effectiveness that blockchain technology offers. We recently announced that we are developing an open source, multimedia delivery platform based on blockchain technology called “PeerStream Protocol,” or “PSP,” that is expected to specialize in routing live, rich media content and powering applications that require real time data and video communications. At launch, we plan for this platform to host new proprietary apps we develop, as well as to allow third-party developers to build the next generation of social networking, messaging, group collaboration and live video streaming applications based on blockchain technologies. In concert with PSP, we are currently developing Backchannel, a blockchain-based secure messaging application that we believe will be the first video messaging application to eliminate a centralized intermediary responsible for hosting and storing user information, thereby reducing the risk that communications between users can be hacked, stolen or leaked.
 
We believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of key business opportunities in our industry by leveraging our technology, user base and suite of complementary applications to provide video, voice and chat services and experiences with superior security, scalability and cost-efficiency.
 
Key Business Strengths
 
Early Mover to Live Video
 
We believe our early development and use of live video and dating applications have enabled us to have a leading position in the live video industry today. Our products, Paltalk and Camfrog, together host one of the world's largest collections of video-based communities and we believe live video will in time become ubiquitous and an integral element of social networking, messaging and online business applications. Our early mover advantage enables us to seize growth opportunities with existing and new products as the popularity and pervasiveness of live video increases.
Engaging Functionality
 
We have designed our applications with browse functions and other features that prompt interactions between users, which make our applications highly engaging and easy to use. While many online applications and websites provide similar functionality, many competitive services require meaningful effort and initiative on the part of the user to make contact with other users. Our applications are designed to eliminate effort and friction in user-to-user interaction by organizing users around common interests or automating certain aspects of the introductory dialog between users. As a result, we believe our users find our experience more social and enjoyable than many competitive social networking and dating services.
Freemium Online Model 
 
We operate our video chat and dating products on a “freemium” model in which certain application features are free to all users and other features are only available to paid subscribers or other paying members. Dating users are allowed to create a profile, browse, search and view profiles of other users, send instant messages and send an initial message to any user. Premium features, such as access to multiple video chat rooms and enhanced status in the community for our video chat applications or unlimited custom messaging for our dating applications, require a paid subscription. We believe this “freemium” model differentiates us from some other like applications in the industry.
 
Data-Driven Model 
 
We have developed data analytics and application development processes that we believe provide us with a competitive advantage over many other video chat and online dating applications and platforms. Our data analytics provide us with critical visibility into the effectiveness of our sales and marketing expense which allows us to quickly modify such expenditures to create more effective user acquisition campaigns. Our application development processes include a sophisticated A/B testing framework, a framework for comparing two versions of the same application, which allows us to test new features, new functionality, design changes, changes to our proprietary algorithms and compare our results to control groups. These processes provide a real-time granular analysis of user behavior with the intention to modify our applications to improve the user experience as well as increase user engagement in order to increase the number of users that convert into paying subscribers.

Highly Scalable Platform 
 
Our applications are extremely scalable and require limited incremental cost to host additional users, create new features catering to additional discrete audiences, or build new applications based on developed feature-sets with new brand identities. Our video chat properties are built on a highly scalable architecture that enables them to power thousands of chat rooms and live streams simultaneously. This technology is used to power topical discussions in several different formats, including interactions on a one-on-one, one-to-many and many-to-many basis. Our dating platforms allow thousands of simultaneous users to browse the profile of other users, message other users or otherwise be active on our website and applications.
Subscriber Base
 
Our applications and the majority of revenues generated therefrom are supported by a large user database of approximately 164,000 active subscribers worldwide as of March 16, 2018. Our management believes that the scale of our subscriber base presents a competitive advantage in the video chat and dating industry and can present growth opportunities to advance existing products with upsell opportunities as well as to build future brands with cross-sell offers. We also believe that our large user base provides us the opportunity to utilize our blockchain development efforts to offer products and services at scale with the benefits of this advanced technology. The scale of our usage also offers us the opportunity to build our third party advertising revenue.
Company Business Strategy
 
Build on Blockchain Technology
 
We recently announced a multipoint strategy to extend our existing capabilities in multimedia streaming and communications while embracing the growth potential and technological capabilities of blockchain technology. We are currently in the process of developing PSP, an open source protocol for multimedia streaming and communications, and our first blockchain-based application, Backchannel. We are also exploring opportunities to enhance our existing applications with blockchain technology. We believe that using blockchain technology provides several key advantages over the traditional technology used to develop live multimedia streaming and communications applications:

● | Scalability: Blockchain-based networks are formed through community contribution of computing resources, and with compensation mediated through consensus protocols, these peer networks become professionalized. Because they can tap into millions of contributors around the world, these peer networks have the potential to scale far greater than any existing private networks. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Cost-Efficiency: Because blockchain technology would eliminate the need for us to serve as an intermediary by hosting servers to transmit data between users, we expect that the transition to blockchain-based applications could significantly reduce our overhead by decreasing our hosting expenses. Though decentralized peer network hosts would require compensation, we expect that compensation costs will be lower than the cost of centralized hosting. 
● | Security: The decentralized architecture of blockchain networks typically is not vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, one of the most common security issues of today’s internet. This saves developers the high overhead of various security countermeasures, as well as offering improved uptime. 

 
In order to drive our blockchain strategy, we formed a Blockchain Advisory Board in November 2017. The purpose of the Blockchain Advisory Board is to assist us in:
 

● | developing our blockchain-based initiatives, including PSP and Backchannel; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | extending business relationships and forming partnerships with blockchain influencers and innovators to help further our blockchain strategy, including the development of PSP and other elements of our blockchain technology portfolio; and 
● | identifying potential strategic M&A with or equity and token investments in blockchain companies that can accelerate our execution ability or extend our market position. 

 
As part of our blockchain strategy, in the second half of 2017, we expanded our payment processing options on two of our applications, Camfrog and Tinychat, to accept bitcoin as a form of payment. Upon receipt of a bitcoin payment, our payment processor automatically converts the bitcoin into U.S. dollars, so that we receive payment for the transaction in U.S. dollars.

In December 2017, we took two steps to advance our blockchain strategy. First, we initiated a strategic product development and technology relationship with blockchain security innovator, Gladius Network, LLC (“Gladius”). Gladius is building a decentralized solution to protect against DDoS attacks that we believe has promise to integrate into our technology platform that supports several our applications. As part of our strategic relationship with Gladius, we also made a small investment in Gladius’ initial coin offering.
 
In addition, based on the research and recommendation of our development team, we selected the blockchain protocol of NEM.io Foundation Ltd. (“NEM”), one of industry’s leading blockchain technology projects, to power our core blockchain infrastructure. We believe that NEM’s highly regarded technology will offer us the right combination of premier security, capability, flexibility and scalability, coupled with a strong, passionate core development team and community.
 
Develop PSP as an Open Source Media Streaming Protocol
 
We believe our video technology has broad applications to many other industries beyond video social networking. Additionally, we believe that our multimedia streaming technology is scalable and applicable to a large array of applications for consumer and business end users. Through the development of PSP, an open source multimedia streaming and communication protocol, we intend to explore opportunities to contribute technology to and collaborate with leading companies in other industries seeking to integrate multimedia communication or improve their existing service. These partnerships can take many different forms, all of which ultimately may help us to drive the value of our technology and build our business.
Introduce New Applications
 
We plan to enhance our existing applications and develop new applications around our core video chat and blockchain technologies. For example, as described above, we have started development of Backchannel, a blockchain-based secure messaging application, which we expect to launch in the fourth quarter of 2018 targeting privacy-minded consumers as well as business and government end users.
Launch PeerStream Business Solutions 
 
On March 8, 2018, we launched PeerStream Business Solutions to provide technology licensing, services and support related to multimedia streaming and communications for third party developers and corporate clients (“PeerStream Business Solutions”). PeerStream Business Solutions is intended to leverage our nearly 20 years of technology innovation to tap into a potential new B2B revenue stream and support the efforts of a broad range of prospective corporate clients to adopt blockchain technology.
 
On March 21, 2018, as a first step in providing services through PeerStream Business Solutions, we entered into a technology services agreement with ProximaX Limited (“ProximaX”) whereby we agreed to provide certain development and related services to ProximaX to facilitate the implementation of PSP into ProximaX’s proprietary blockchain protocol that is currently under development. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, ProximaX agreed to pay us up to an aggregate of $10.0 million of cash in exchange for our services, with $5.0 million due upon the successful consummation of a future initial coin offering by ProximaX and up to an additional $5.0 million due upon our achievement of certain development milestones set forth in the agreement. In addition, ProximaX agreed to issue us a number of tokens equal to 2.4% of all outstanding tokens on the date of the planned initial coin offering and to reserve an additional 2% of such tokens to be issued as payment for future services provided by us, subject, in each case, to such initial coin offering generating aggregate gross proceeds of at least $30.0 million. If the planned initial coin offering does not raise at least $30.0 million or ProximaX fails to pay us the upfront cash payment of $5.0 million by June 1, 2018, we and ProximaX have agreed to negotiate alternative compensation for our services in good faith.
 
Defend our Intellectual Property
 
We have a portfolio of 26 issued patents. We have successfully defended our intellectual property in the past and have generated tens of millions of dollars in licensing fees for the use of our patents. In 2016, we commenced an enforcement action related to two of our patents against Riot Games, Inc. and Valve Corporation for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,822,523 and 6,226,686 with respect to their online games League of Legends and Defense of the Ancients 2. These two patents were previously asserted against, and then licensed to, Microsoft, Sony, and Activision. For additional information concerning the status of these proceedings, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” herein.

Our Products
 
Live Video Chat
 
We have five existing products in the video chat space: Paltalk; Camfrog; Tinychat; Ribbit Live; and Firetalk. In addition, we are currently developing a new blockchain based video application, Backchannel, which is expected to launch in the fourth quarter of 2018. The major revenue-generating Live Video Chat products are Paltalk and Camfrog. Each product enables individuals to self-organize around topics and users with common affinities. Tinychat, Ribbit Live and Firetalk enable adaptations of our video technology for alternative uses and opportunities in the future.
 
Key features and tools of our video chat applications include:
 

● | Profile Creation: Our video chat products are intuitive and allow users to easily find, connect and communicate with each other based on a user’s particular interest. Users can join our video chat properties by creating a personal profile that is connected to their email address or by using “Facebook Connect®” to create a profile. A user with a Facebook® profile can easily import information from his or her profile, including photos and interest data. Once a profile has been created, users are able to search our thousands of chat rooms organized by topics and easily click to join one. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dynamic Tools and Features: Our video chat products are also dynamic and offer the chance for users to message and/or talk with others while also viewing them through live video. Once a user joins a chat room, he/she can directly message another individual or join a group community chat. Users also have the option to listen to the group through their device microphone and to join a queue for a turn to speak out loud to the group. Two users can also choose to have a one-on-one private live video chat. Our products offer the tools for users to administer the experience in a particular chat room. Users that open chat rooms can mute other users, restrict other users from broadcasting video, and remove a user’s ability to text. Additionally, each user that opens a chat room not only can exercise these administrative controls, they can also deputize other users to be administrators in their rooms, further helping to create a managed and enjoyable experience. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paltalk and Camfrog. Paltalk and Camfrog are our major video chat applications and are both leading providers of live video social networking applications available on Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android and other tablet devices. Together, these products power one of the world’s largest global collections of video based communities, with proprietary technology to host thousands of simultaneous live group conversations on topics such as politics, financial markets, music and dating. Our proprietary client server technology helps maintain high quality video and audio even as many users simultaneously watch a particular broadcaster. Paltalk and Camfrog both have hundreds of millions of registered users and attract a demographically and geographically diverse user base, with users in over 180 different countries. Paltalk users are approximately one-third domestic and two-thirds international, whereas the majority of Camfrog users are international, with a particular concentration in Southeast Asia. 
 
In the first half of 2017, we founded an innovation lab to leverage our technology and commercial platform to support growth initiatives in the live video markets. Through the support of our innovation lab, we recently updated Camfrog to support one-to-many live streaming video capabilities through the launch of Camfrog Live. Camfrog Live offers a wide variety of live video broadcasting entertainment while allowing spontaneous, real-time engagement at a more personal level. The platform offers these viewing users a unique way of connecting and sharing through live interaction with content creators, allowing them to offer feedback and appreciation, including cash donations and tips. Camfrog will continue to support its industry-leading traditional group video chat service, which the Company believes is complemented by the addition of live streaming entertainment. We expect to offer similar one-to-many live streaming video capabilities within our Paltalk application in 2018.
 
PSP. PSP is an open source, decentralized, peer-to-peer multimedia and messaging protocol that, when coupled with blockchain technology, is designed to increase scalability, cost efficiency and security for real-time communication applications in such areas as video conferencing, messaging and workforce collaboration.
Backchannel. Backchannel is a blockchain-based video-enabled secure messaging service we are developing that we plan to release in the fourth quarter of 2018. Backchannel is expected to enable real-time text, voice, and video messaging between individuals and among small groups and to leverage blockchain and other decentralization technologies to offer unique security and privacy benefits. We plan to market Backchannel to privacy-minded consumers around the world, as well as business, legal and government end-users.
 
Backchannel is expected to integrate end-to-end and forward secrecy encryption best practices for communication applications. In addition, we anticipate that Backchannel will use blockchain technology to validate and authenticate users with a crypto identity that does not require any personally identifiable information from the user. As a result, Backchannel will never request or hold the real world identity of its users, and therefore will not have any personal information that could be stolen by hackers. In addition, Backchannel is intended to decentralize the transmission of all communications within its network, meaning that communications will never pass through Backchannel servers, making the application more resistant to censorship, disruption and eavesdropping than traditional communication platforms.

Dating
 
We currently have three dating applications: FirstMet, 50more and The Grade. FirstMet generates substantially all of the revenue in our dating portfolio. 50more, our product targeting users over 50, was launched commercially in July 2017. For the foreseeable future, we expect to focus our dating application resources on FirstMet and 50more.
 
FirstMet. We provide a leading online dating application under the FirstMet brand. FirstMet is native on Facebook, iOS and Android platforms and is also accessible on mobile devices and desktops at FirstMet.com. FirstMet is extremely scalable and requires limited incremental operational cost to add users, active subscribers or new features catering to additional discrete audiences.
 
FirstMet attracts a demographically and geographically diverse user base, with users in over 180 different countries. FirstMet is intuitive, and allows users and subscribers to easily find, connect and communicate with each other. 
 
50more. We introduced 50more commercially in July 2017 as our dating application targeting adults over the age of 50. 50more is based on our FirstMet platform and utilizes the underlying FirstMet infrastructure and technology, a strategy which allowed us to streamline the process of launching 50more as a new and fresh online dating product. 50more has similar functionality to FirstMet but offers more information-rich user profiles and addresses a different target audience of adults over 50.
 
We expect that we will operate 50more in parallel with FirstMet in order to leverage the overlap with FirstMet’s user base and cross sell our users with multiple brands. 50more is available on mobile and desktop platforms.
 
The Grade. The Grade is a free mobile dating application offered on iOS and Android designed to foster a high quality community of users by rewarding good behavior and exposing improper behavior through a programmatic grading algorithm. Despite the uniqueness and early success of The Grade, we decided in late 2015 to shift our promotional and product development resource-focus to FirstMet, with its established user base, and the development of 50more. We believe The Grade remains a viable product with relevant technology, and it may provide a platform in the future for other product opportunities.
 
Telecommunications 
 
We own and operate a small telecommunications provider called Vumber that enables users to have multiple phone numbers in any area code through which calls can be forwarded to a user’s existing cell phone or land line telephone number. Vumber serves both the retail and small business community. Vumber not only allows individuals to communicate while protecting privacy, but also gives business professionals the ability to add a new business line with any chosen area code to their cell phones. Vumber provides an in-depth data analytics platform that can track, record and analyze calls to gain new insights into one’s business.
Product Payment Options
 
Our users have a variety of methods by which to purchase product subscriptions across all of our platforms. Users can pay by credit card, PayPal, Western Union, Check, local e-wallet providers, or complete an in-app purchase through the Apple App Store or Google Play for Android users. As noted above, we also expanded our payment options on certain of our applications in 2017 to include bitcoin as a method of payment. However, any payment made in bitcoin is automatically converted by our payment processor into U.S. dollars so that we receive U.S. dollars for the transaction.
 
Apple retains 30% of the revenue that is generated from sales on our iPhone application through in-app purchases in the United States. Google also retains 30% of the revenue that is generated from sales on Android applications via Google wallet through in-app purchases in the United States.
 
All of our credit card transactions are processed through various payment providers. Video chat users in certain international territories also have an option to purchase through local resellers. Local resellers prepay in bulk for services and debit the prepaid balance as one-time subscriptions and virtual currency are sold to end users. Regardless of which payment method is utilized, users may access our products through any of the gateways we offer.
 
Product Development and Innovation Lab
 
We are continually developing new products, as well as optimizing our existing platforms and feature sets in order to meet the evolving needs of our user base and advertising partners.
 
We develop most of our software internally. We will, however, purchase technology and license intellectual property rights where it is strategically important, operationally compatible, or economically advantageous. For instance, we partner with third parties to further our internationalization efforts as we look to bring additional languages into our existing platforms. We are not materially dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties relating to product development.

In the first half of 2017, we founded an innovation lab to leverage our technology and commercial platform to support growth initiatives in the live video markets. Our innovation lab contributed to the launch of the blockchain initiative, and is currently pursuing live video social networking and live streaming entertainment opportunities on mobile, two areas that we believe show extraordinary promise for user adoption and revenue growth. As described above, our innovation lab recently launched Camfrog Live as an update to our existing Camfrog application to provide support for one-to-many live streaming videos and to include new monetization opportunities for content creators. We believe that the launch of Camfrog Live has the potential to substantially grow our user base by providing a compelling platform for live video interactions.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
We invest in advertising and marketing for the purpose of acquiring users. We adapt our marketing expenditures and channels as we gather the data to analyze the success of our campaigns. We primarily advertise through Internet and mobile advertising networks and run hundreds of campaigns at any given time, targeting various audiences of users, and focusing on campaigns that we believe will produce a positive return over the lifetime of new users. We also generate new sign-ups organically, as people find our sites and applications through brand recognition and word of mouth, search engines and product review websites.
Competition and Our Industry
 
Our products face substantial competition in both the live video and dating industries. We have direct competition from many live video streaming websites including YouNow, Live.me, BIGO Live, Live.ly, Houseparty, Facebook Live, YouTube Live, Instagram Live, and Twitch. In the dating industry, we compete with online dating websites such as OkCupid.com, Christianmingle.com, eHarmony.com, POF.com, Match Group, Inc. properties, as well as online dating applications provided by Badoo Trading Limited, IAC, Affinitas, MeetMe, Inc. and Zoosk, Inc. We also face substantial competition from mobile-based applications including Tinder, Happn, Hinge and Bumble. In addition, the products within our portfolio both compete and collaborate with each other.
 
As technology evolves and the lines between video and dating become less defined, many of these and other properties will become our competitors. There are relatively few significant barriers to entry in our industry and, as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and technical expertise may become a competitor. Nonetheless, we believe that users often utilize multiple applications for multiple purposes, and the use of one website or application is not necessarily to the exclusion of others.
 
Achieving a critical mass of users is crucial for our applications. As a result of our large and dynamic user base, we believe we are well-positioned to continue as a leader in the industries in which we currently operate. Additionally, we seek to offer applications and services that are differentiated in the industry, superior in quality and more appealing than those of our competitors. We also believe that we have the tools and expertise to attract new users through Facebook and other sources at a lower cost per subscriber than certain of our traditional competitors. As social networking application platforms and mobile platforms continue to expand and the Internet becomes ever more of a mainstream method for connecting and interacting with others, we believe that the industries we operate within offer substantial room for growth.
 
Patent and Trademarks
 
To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, patent applications, confidentiality agreements and other contractual rights. We have 26 registered trademarks in the United States and internationally. We have a patent portfolio of 26 patents, and we have historically generated tens of millions of dollars successfully defending our patents. We continue to pursue patents related to certain feature sets on applications currently under development, as well as defend our intellectual property as appropriate. In 2016, we commenced an enforcement action related to two of our patents against Riot Games, Inc. and Valve Corporation for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,822,523 and 6,226,686 with respect to their online games League of Legends and Defense of the Ancients 2. These two patents were previously asserted against, and then licensed to, Microsoft, Sony, and Activision. For additional information concerning the status of these proceedings, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” herein.
Governmental Regulations
 
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and being litigated in the courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations may involve user privacy, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal and state laws regarding privacy and protection of user data, which are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. We are also subject to diverse and evolving laws and regulations in other countries in which we operate. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which we operate. Because our applications are accessible worldwide and used by residents of some foreign countries, foreign jurisdictions may claim that we must comply with foreign laws, even in jurisdictions in which we have no local business entity, employees or infrastructure.

We are also subject to federal laws and regulations regarding content, privacy and the protection of user data, including The Communications Decency Act of 1996, as amended (“The Communications Decency Act”), The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as amended, The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, as amended, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing (“CAN-SPAM”) Act of 2003, among others. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act limits our liability as an online service provider for linking to or hosting third-party content that infringes copyrights. The Communications Decency Act provides statutory protections to online service providers like us who distribute third-party content. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act restricts the ability of online service providers to collect personal information from children under 13. Congress, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and many states have promulgated laws and regulations regarding email advertising, including the CAN-SPAM Act. Any changes in these laws or judicial interpretations narrowing the protections of these laws may subject us to increased risk, increased costs of compliance, and limits on the operation of certain parts of our business.
 
Growing public concern about privacy and the use of personal information may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny. The FTC has, over the last few years, begun investigating companies that have used personally identifiable information in a deceptive or unfair manner or in violation of a posted privacy policy. The European Union is implementing a new privacy directive called the Global Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) that comes into effect in May 2018 and will impose additional new regulatory scrutiny on our business in that geographic region with possible financial consequences for noncompliance. If we are accused of violating the terms of our privacy policy or implementing unfair privacy practices, we may be forced to expend significant financial and managerial resources to defend against an FTC or GDPR enforcement action. Our user database holds the personal information of our users and subscribers residing in the United States and other countries, and we could be sued by those users if any of the information is misappropriated. Any failure by us to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data could also result in loss of user confidence in our online dating applications and services and ultimately in a loss of active subscribers, which could adversely affect our business.
 
In addition, virtually every U.S. state has passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data resulting in unauthorized disclosure, many of which are modeled on California’s Information Practices Act. There are a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress and various state legislative bodies concerning data protection that could, if adopted, have an adverse effect on our business. We are unable to determine if and when such legislation may be adopted. Many jurisdictions, including the European Union, have adopted breach notification and other data protection notification laws designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information. The introduction of new privacy and data breach laws and the interpretation of existing privacy and data breach laws in the United States, Europe and other foreign jurisdictions is constantly evolving. There is a risk that new laws may be introduced or existing laws may be applied in a way that would conflict our current data protection practices or prevent the transfer of data between countries in which we operate.
 
While online personal services are not currently required to verify the age or identity of subscribers, or to run criminal background checks, legislation in this area has been proposed over the last few years in Ohio, Texas, California, Michigan, New Jersey, Florida and Virginia. Companies that provide personal services are not currently subject to the same type of regulation as companies deemed “dating service” providers. However, if a court holds that we are legally providing “dating services” as defined in the relevant regulations, we may be required to comply with additional state regulations. Further, Connecticut, New York, Florida, Texas and New Jersey each have enacted laws that require us to display safety warnings and disclosures to users that we do not conduct background checks.
 
In addition, rising concern about the use of social networking technologies for illegal conduct may in the future produce legislation or other governmental action that could require changes to our online dating applications or restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business. These regulatory and legislative developments, including excessive taxation, may prevent or significantly limit our ability to expand our business.
 
We may also become subject to laws or regulations in the future that limit our ability to accept bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment or to otherwise hold bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. As cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies, with certain governments deeming cryptocurrency offerings and cryptocurrency exchanges illegal, while others have allowed their use and trade. Governments may in the future curtail or outlaw the acquisition or use of cryptocurrencies or the exchange of cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies. Ownership of, holding, trading in or participating in offerings of cryptocurrencies may then be considered illegal and subject to sanction. Governments may also take regulatory action that may increase the cost and/or subject companies that transact in or hold cryptocurrencies to additional regulation.
