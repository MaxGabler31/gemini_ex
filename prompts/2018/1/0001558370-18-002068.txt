 Item 1.  Business.
 General
 We are a blank check company incorporated on December 4, 2015 as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (“business combination”). We have reviewed, and continue to review, a number of opportunities to enter into a business combination with an operating business, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete a business combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business have not been limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we have focused our search on targeted North American or European healthcare related business. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 Prior to our Public Offering, on December 14, 2015, our Sponsor purchased 8,625,000 shares (the “Founder Shares”) of our Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class B ordinary shares”), for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. In October 2016, our Sponsor transferred 50,000 Founder Shares to each of our independent directors at their original per share purchase price. In addition, at such time, each of our independent directors purchased an additional 421,250 Founder Shares from our Sponsor at their original purchase price.
 On the Close Date, we consummated our Public Offering of 30,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit generating gross proceeds of $300,000,000 before underwriting discounts and expenses. Each unit (“Unit”) consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A ordinary shares” and, together with the Class B ordinary share, the “ordinary shares”), and one warrant to purchase one‑half of one Class A ordinary share for $5.75 per one‑half share (or $11.50 per whole share) (each, a “Warrant”). Simultaneously with the closing of our Public Offering, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 16,000,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”), at a purchase price of $0.50 per Private Placement Warrant, to our Sponsor and our independent directors (collectively, the “Initial Shareholders”), generating gross proceeds to the Company of $8,000,000.
 On November 28, 2016, we completed the sale of an additional 1,000,000 Units to the underwriters of the Public Offering at the public offering price of $10.00 per Unit pursuant to the partial exercise of the over‑allotment option granted to the underwriters in connection with our Public Offering (the “Over‑allotment Option”). On November 28, 2016, we sold an additional 400,000 Private Placement Warrants for an aggregate purchase price of $200,000 in connection with the exercise of the Over‑allotment Option. Following the partial exercise of the Over‑allotment Option, 875,000 Founder Shares were forfeited in order to maintain the ownership of the Initial Shareholders at 20% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares. On November 28, 2016, our Sponsor sold 161,180 Founder Shares and 350,114 Private Placement Warrants to one of our independent directors at their original purchase price. On July 5, 2017, our Sponsor sold 186,320 Founder Shares and 404,723 Private Placement Warrants to one of our independent directors at their original per share purchase price.
 We received gross proceeds from the Public Offering, including the partial exercise of the Over‑allotment Option, and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants of $310,000,000 and $8,200,000, respectively, for an aggregate of $318,200,000. Of such amount, $310,000,000 was deposited in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (“Trustee”) acting as Trustee (the “Trust Account”). The remaining $8,200,000 was held outside of the Trust Account, of which $6,200,000 was used to pay underwriting discounts, with the balance used to repay a note to our Sponsor and to pay accrued offering and formation costs, and the remainder was reserved for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. In the future, a portion of interest income on the funds held in the Trust Account may be released to us to pay tax obligations. At December 31, 2017, $312,497,921 was held in the Trust Account and consisted of cash and money market funds.

 On November 28, 2016, we announced that, commencing November 29, 2016, holders of the 31,000,000 Units sold in the Public Offering may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares and Warrants included in the Units. Those Units not separated will continue to trade on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (“NASDAQ”) Capital Market under the symbol “AHPAU,” and the Class A ordinary shares and Warrants that are separated will trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols “AHPA” and “AHPAW,” respectively.
 While we may acquire a target business in any industry or location, our focus will be to acquire and operate a North American or European healthcare related business. We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive acquisition candidates because of their extensive contacts and transaction sources, including a broad list of industry executives, public board members, private owners, wealthy families, private capital managers, private equity funds, investment bankers and other transaction intermediaries. A central component of our acquisition strategy is our management team's ability to implement value creation initiatives designed to drive shareholder value as they have done in the past for Avista portfolio companies, not all of which have achieved the same level of shareholder value.
 Recent Developments
 On August 21, 2017, the Company, Merger Sub, Avista Healthcare NewCo, LLC (“NewCo”), Envigo International Holdings, Inc. (“Envigo”), and Jermyn Street Associates, LLC, solely in its capacity as Shareholder Representative, entered into a Transaction Agreement (as amended on November 22, 2017 and as further amended on December 22, 2017, January 21, 2018 and February 9, 2018, the “Transaction Agreement”) providing for a proposed business combination. 
 On February 14, 2018, we executed and entered into a Mutual Termination Agreement (the “Mutual Termination Agreement”) pursuant to Section 7.1(a) of the Transaction Agreement, with NewCo, Envigo, and Jermyn Street Associates, LLC, solely in its capacity as shareholder representative, for the purpose of mutually terminating the Transaction Agreement, and all proposed transactions relating to the merger. The Transaction Agreement was terminated effective as of February 14, 2018.
 Business Strategy
 Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after a business combination, build a company in the healthcare sector in the public markets that complements the experience and expertise of our management team and board members (the “AHPAC team”). Elements of our business strategy include the following:
· | Utilize the extensive sourcing network of the AHPAC team—We intend to source investment opportunities through our team’s extensive network of healthcare industry executives, board members, private equity investors, wealthy families, commercial banks, investment bankers, advisors, attorneys, accountants and other transaction intermediaries to identify potential investment opportunities. We believe this approach will yield a large number of acquisition candidates. Avista’s distinctive healthcare focused network, coupled with its proactive approach to sourcing, has provided our management team and directors with a flow of referrals that have resulted in numerous transactions for Avista, several of which were proprietary and not available to generalist or less focused participants.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Target high‑quality businesses in multiple healthcare sectors—The AHPAC team has experience that spans a variety of different healthcare sectors. AHPAC intends to focus primarily on companies in the pharmaceutical, medical device, pharmaceutical and device outsourcing, healthcare distribution and healthcare related consumer sub‑sectors. AHPAC intends to target companies believed to have scalable, protected products and services in non‑cyclical sectors with expected long‑term sustainable competitive advantages. We believe that companies in the aforementioned targeted sub‑sectors are well positioned to benefit from the expected growth in global healthcare spending.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Focus on corporate carve‑outs as a potential source of transactions—We believe that recent trends in certain healthcare sectors have created unique investment opportunities which we are well‑positioned to capitalize on given our management team’s experience in carving‑out products and businesses from larger healthcare companies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Seek operational intensive opportunities—We believe that a unique attribute of the AHPAC team is its strong operating capabilities. The AHPAC team has experience in:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Identifying, mentoring and recruiting world‑class talent;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | Operating companies and setting and implementing strategies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | Developing and growing companies, both organically and inorganically, and expanding their sales and business development capabilities, products and geographic footprint;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adding value to companies post acquisition by accelerating their access to additional growth opportunities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Optimize the financial situation of target companies—The AHPAC team has extensive capital markets and financial capabilities that we believe have added substantial value to a number of target businesses. The AHPAC team has experience:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sourcing, structuring, financing, acquiring, and selling businesses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Accessing the capital markets, including financing businesses and helping companies transition to public ownership;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Executing transactions in multiple geographies and under varying economic and financial market conditions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Acquisition Process
 Utilizing the processes developed while at Avista, our management team’s emphasis during the due diligence stage will be on how to maximize value, reduce risk and preserve the capital of a potential acquisition. Our team’s due diligence review includes the development of a plan to assess each critical success factor and risk associated with an acquisition opportunity. In an effort to mitigate potential risks, our team has typically conducted extensive due diligence in a variety of areas, including business, finance, competitive analysis, management assessment, accounting, legal, employee benefits, insurance and risk management. The diligence process typically has included:
· | Business diligence: extensive review of the target’s business history, current condition and future prospects. This analysis typically includes a thorough review of the target’s strategy, trends, assets, risks and opportunities and an assessment of its key customers and suppliers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Industry and competitive analysis: assessment of the target’s competition, relative positioning, barriers to entry and cost position. We expect this diligence will benefit from the insight of the AHPAC team, augmented with other industry experts and third‑party consulting firms, as required;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Management assessment: detailed evaluation of management including on‑site interviews, reference calls and background checks;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Financial and accounting review: detailed analysis of the target’s financial condition including accounting policies, quality of earnings and operating trends, capital requirements and tax position. This analysis is typically completed with the assistance of third‑party accounting advisors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Legal diligence: thorough investigation of the target’s corporate and tax structure, material contracts, history of and prospects for litigation, potential environmental issues and other material legal matters. This review is typically completed with the assistance of legal advisors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Employee benefits, insurance and risk management diligence: detailed review of the company’s current benefits programs and insurance coverage with a view toward finding opportunities to make improvements and/or lower cost. This review is typically completed with the assistance of third‑party advisors
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The AHPAC team has taken an active role in seeking to drive value creation. Our approach to operational value creation requires active involvement and close partnership with potential management teams.

  Our acquisition criteria, due diligence processes and value creation methods are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to such business combination.
 Other Acquisition Considerations
 We are not prohibited from pursuing a business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete a business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, that a business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own our ordinary shares and/or Private Placement Warrants following this offering, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate a business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to a business combination.
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then‑current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete a business combination.
 Our Sponsor, officers, and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding a business combination or we have failed to complete a business combination within 24 months after the Closing Date. None of our officers or directors has been involved with any blank check companies in the past.
 Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets
 We believe our management team’s significant operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring, financing and selling businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.

 We are not prohibited from pursuing a business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete a business combination with a target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, that such a business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 As more fully discussed in “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance—Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre‑existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. All of our officers currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.
 Status as a Public Company
 We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares or for a combination of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred for marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
 Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters' ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders' interests. Our structure may offer further benefits by augmenting a company's profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the Close Date, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non‑affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non‑convertible debt during the prior three‑year period.
 Financial Position
 With funds available for a business combination of $312,497,921, assuming no redemptions and after payment of $10,850,000 of deferred underwriting discounts, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete a business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.

 Effecting a Business Combination
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate a business combination using the proceeds held in the Trust Account from the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of these as the consideration. We may seek to complete a business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 If a business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with a business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may utilize the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post‑transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing a business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of a business combination, and we may effectuate a business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than utilizing the funds held in the Trust Account.
 In the case of a business combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with a business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
 Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
 The NASDAQ rules require that a business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting comissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with a business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with a business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate a business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 We anticipate structuring a business combination so that the post‑transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a business combination such that the post‑transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post‑transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post‑transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post‑transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares

subsequent to a business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post‑transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If a business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
 To the extent we effect a business combination with a target business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such a business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we continue to conduct a thorough due diligence review encompassing, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us.
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination, and the costs associated with this process are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 Lack of Business Diversification
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of a business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we intend to focus our search for a business combination in a single industry. By completing a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
· | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after a business combination, and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of a business combination.
 Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance incumbent management.

 Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve a Business Combination
 We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons.
 Under NASDAQ’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for a business combination if, for example:

· | we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of Class A ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders, as defined by NASDAQ rules, has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Permitted Purchases of Our Securities
 In the event we seek shareholder approval of a business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with a business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of a business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares such persons may purchase. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non‑public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going‑private transaction subject to the going‑private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of a business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of a business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with a business combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against the business combination. Such persons would select the shareholders from whom to acquire shares based on the 

 
  11

 
number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with the business combination.
 Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders Upon Completion of a Business Combination
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares (collectively, the “Public Shares”) upon the completion of a business combination at a per‑share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the business combination, including interest, which interest shall be net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is approximately $10.08 per Public Share. The per‑share amount we will distribute to shareholders who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our Initial Shareholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and any Public Shares they may hold in connection with the completion of a business combination. Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless shareholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons.
 If a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:

· | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e‑4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Upon the public announcement of a business combination, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5‑1 to purchase our Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our Public Shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e‑5 under the Exchange Act.
 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e‑1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete a business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than a specified number of Public Shares which are not purchased by our Sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001, so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules, or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to a business combination. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the business combination.

 
  12

 

 If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:

· | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

  We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public shareholders at least 10 days prior to the shareholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such shareholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any shareholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NASDAQ listing or Exchange Act registration.
 In the event that we seek shareholder approval of a business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the business combination.
 If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete a business combination only if a majority of our outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our Initial Shareholders, officers and directors have agreed, and their permitted transferees will agree, to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares held by them in favor of a business combination. We expect that at the time of any shareholder vote relating to a business combination, our Initial Shareholders and their permitted transferees will own at least 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares entitled to vote thereon. In addition, our Initial Shareholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and any owned Public Shares in connection with the completion of a business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules. Redemptions of our Public Shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to a business combination. For example, a proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Public Shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of such a proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any Public Shares, and all Public Shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
 Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of a Business Combination if We Seek Shareholder Approval
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek shareholder approval of a business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with a business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that any individual public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group,” as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Public Shares held in excess of 15% of the total Public Shares issued as part of the Units in our Public Offering (“Excess Shares”), or 4,650,000 Public Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage public shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then‑current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public 

 
  13

 
shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then‑current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting an individual shareholder’s ability to redeem no more than 15% of the Public Shares, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete a business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we have not restricted our public shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares, including Excess Shares, for or against a business combination. Our Initial Shareholders, officers and directors have, pursuant to a letter agreement entered into with us, waived their right to have any Founder Shares or Public Shares held by them redeemed in connection with a business combination. Unless any of our other affiliates acquires Founder Shares through a permitted transfer from an Initial Shareholder, and thereby becomes subject to the letter agreement, no such affiliate is subject to this waiver. However, to the extent any such affiliate acquires Public Shares, such affiliate would be a public shareholder and restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to any Excess Shares.
 Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
 We may require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve a business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s deposit/withdrawal at custodian system (the “DWAC System”), rather than simply voting against the business combination. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our Public Shares in connection with a business combination will indicate whether we require public shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on a business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a shareholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public shareholders at least 10 days prior to the shareholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such shareholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to deliver their Public Shares electronically by means of the DWAC System.
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above‑referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on a business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise its redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for delivery of its certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which it could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, the holder could sell its shares in the open market before actually delivering its shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.

 
  14

 

 Any request to redeem our Public Shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the shareholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a public shareholder delivers its Public Shares in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate physically or electronically. It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our Public Shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of a business combination.
 If a business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public shareholders who elected to redeem their shares.
 If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target business until 24 months after the Close Date.
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Business Combination
 We have only 24 months after the Close Date to complete a business combination. If we are unable to complete a business combination within such 24‑month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per‑share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest, net of taxes (less up to $50,000 of such net interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders, including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any, subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants and Private Placement Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete a business combination within 24 months after the Close Date.
 Our Initial Shareholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares if we fail to complete a business combination within 24 months after the Close Date. However, to the extent our Initial Shareholders own Public Shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if we fail to complete a business combination within the allotted 24‑month time period.
 Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our Public Shares if we do not complete a business combination within 24 months after the Close Date, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per‑share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest, net of taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares. However, we may not redeem our Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules.
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the proceeds of the Public Offering held outside the Trust Account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any earned interest in the Trust Account, net of any funds required to pay taxes, we may request the Trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $50,000 of such earned interest to pay those costs and expenses.

 
  15

 

 If we were to expend all proceeds of the Public Offering held outside of the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest earned on the Trust Account, the per‑share redemption amount received by public shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per‑share redemption amount received by public shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers other than our independent auditors, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. Upon redemption of our Public Shares, if we are unable to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with a business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor (other than our independent auditors) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.00 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act . In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third‑party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per‑share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per share.
 We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers other than our independent auditors, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under 

 
  16

 
our indemnity of the underwriters of the Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. At December 31, 2017, we had a working capital deficit of $3,634,283 and we had access to cash of $125,886 from the proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $50,000). In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended business combination, the Company issued to the Sponsor on August 11, 2017, an unsecured promissory note pursuant to which the Company is permitted to borrow up to $300,000 in aggregate principal amount. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has borrowed $100,000 under such note. In addition certain vendors have agreed to defer the payment of invoices until the earlier of a close of a business combination or a liquidation of the Company. As of December 31, 2017, $3,774,090 of accrued expenses were deferred. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our Company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only in the event of the redemption of our Public Shares if we do not complete a business combination within 24 months after the Close Date or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the business combination. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with a business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.
 Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain certain requirements and restrictions that apply to us until the consummation of a business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in connection with any such vote. Our Initial Shareholders, officers and directors have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and any Public Shares held in connection with the completion of a business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that:
· | prior to the consummation of a business combination, we shall either (1) seek shareholder approval of a business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest, which interest shall be net of taxes payable, or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer, and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote, for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest, which interest shall be net of taxes payable, in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we will consummate a business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  17

 


· | if a business combination is not consummated within 24 months after the Close Date, then we will liquidate the Company and distribute all funds held in the Trust Account; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | prior to a business combination, we may not issue additional ordinary shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the Trust Account or (ii) vote on any business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of at least two thirds of our ordinary shares. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with a business combination, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that we may consummate a business combination only if approved by holders of a majority of our ordinary shares voted, voting at a duly held shareholders meeting.
 Competition
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for a business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination and our outstanding Warrants and Private Placement Warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Employees
 We currently have four officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed a business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for a business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 Our Units, Class A ordinary shares and Warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and as a result we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The public may read and copy any material we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1‑800‑SEC‑0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at: http://www.sec.gov. The contents of these websites are not incorporated into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to the uniform resource locators (“URLs”) for these websites are intended to be inactive textual references only.
 We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of a business combination. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report on Form 10‑K contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), or International Financing Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”). These 

 
  18

 
financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures as of December 31, 2017 as required by the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer that is not an “emerging growth company” as described below will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such target business to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete a business acquisition with such a target business.
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non‑binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the Close Date, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non‑affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non‑convertible debt during the prior three‑year period.
