Item 1. Business
General 
ADA-ES, Inc. (“ADA”), a Colorado corporation, was incorporated in 1997. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Reorganization"), effective July 1, 2013, Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc. (“ADES”), a Delaware company incorporated in 2011, replaced ADA as the publicly-held corporation and ADA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADES. Each outstanding share of ADA’s common stock automatically converted into one share of common stock of ADES and the shareholders of ADA became stockholders of ADES on a one-for-one basis, holding the same number of shares in and the same ownership percentage of ADES after the reorganization as they held in and of ADA prior to the reorganization. ADES’s common stock became listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol, "ADES," ADA’s previous symbol, and ADA’s stock ceased trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on July 1, 2013. From March 30, 2015 through July 6, 2016, ADES's common stock was traded on the OTC Pink® Marketplace - Limited Information Tier under the trading symbol "ADES." Effective, July 7, 2016 ADES's common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol, ADES. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is referred to as the "Form 10-K" or the "Report." 
As this filing pertains to the year ended December 31, 2017, the terms the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" means ADA and its consolidated subsidiaries for the periods through and including the period ended June 30, 2013 and ADES and its consolidated subsidiaries for the dates or periods after July 1, 2013. 
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we held equity interests of 42.50% and 50.00% in Tinuum Group, LLC ("Tinuum Group") and Tinuum Services, LLC ("Tinuum Services"), respectively, and each of their operations significantly impacted our financial position and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. We account for Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services under the equity method of accounting. 
On July 27, 2017, the Company obtained a 50% membership interest in GWN Manager in exchange for a capital contribution of $0.1 million. GWN Manager subsequently purchased a 0.2% membership interest in a subsidiary of Tinuum Group.
Business Purpose and Strategy
We provide emissions solutions to customers in the coal-fired power generation and industrial boiler processes. We provide environmental control chemicals, equipment and technologies to our primary market that consists of approximately 650 coal-fired electrical generation units located in the United States. 
Through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, we are a leader in emissions control ("EC") technologies and associated equipment, chemicals and services. Our proprietary environmental technologies enable our customers to reduce emissions of mercury and other pollutants, maximize utilization levels and improve operating efficiencies to meet the challenges of existing and pending EC regulations.
Our major activities include:

• | Development and sale of specialty chemicals, equipment, consulting services and other products designed to reduce emissions of mercury, acid gases, metals and other pollutants, and the providing of technology services in support of our customers' emissions compliance strategies; and


• | Through Tinuum Group, an unconsolidated entity, reduction of mercury and nitrogen oxide ("NOX") emissions at select coal-fired power generators through the production and sale of Refined Coal ("RC") that qualifies for tax credits under the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 45 - Production Tax Credit ("Section 45 tax credits"). We benefit from Tinuum Group's production and sale of RC, which generates tax credits, as well as the revenue from selling or leasing RC facilities to tax equity investors. See the separately filed financial statements of Tinuum Group included in Item 15 - "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" ("Item 15") of this Report.

Markets for Our Products and Services
We expect that the share of coal-fired power generation as a percentage of U.S. electricity generation to be more stable compared to previous years when many coal-fired generating units were shut down in response to low gas prices and increasingly stringent environmental regulations. Further, we believe that coal-fired power generation will remain a significant component of the U.S. power generation mix for many years, given coal's abundance, affordability, reliability and availability as a domestic fuel source. Currently, the Energy Information Administration ("EIA") estimates coal makes up 30% of the 
3

United States electric generation. In its Annual Energy Outlook for 2017, the EIA projects that coal will provide between 24% and 33% of electricity generation in 2040 depending on whether the Clean Power Plan ("CPP") of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), which addresses limiting greenhouse gas emissions, is or is not implemented. The primary drivers for many of our products and services are environmental laws and regulations impacting the electric power generation industry and other coal users. These regulations include the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards ("MATS"), a U.S. federal regulation requiring all existing and any new coal-fired electric generating units to control mercury emissions, acid gases, and particulate matter, as well as various state regulations and permitting requirements for coal-fired electric generating units. In addition to the federal MATS rule, certain states have their own mercury rules that are similar to, or more stringent than, MATS, and many coal-fired electric generating units around the country have agreed to consent decrees, which require pollution controls that, in some cases, are more restrictive than the existing regulations. We continue to believe the MATS regulation as well as certain state regulations create a market for our RC and EC products. 
In general, coal is a low cost, stable and reliable source of domestic energy that, unlike many other forms of energy, can be easily stored in large quantities. We believe coal is critical to ensuring the U.S. has a secure and stable source of energy. With current environmental regulations, we believe it is unlikely that any new coal-fired electric generating units will be financed or constructed, which suggests that the average coal-fired electric generating unit age in 2040 will be 64 years old. However, following the retirement of many of the less efficient and generally smaller coal-fired electric generating units over the past few years, and the announcement from the EPA on October 10, 2017 of their proposal to repeal the CPP, we believe that the amount of electricity generated from coal will remain relatively steady in the near term.
While the long-term future is uncertain, and as coal assets continue to age, we expect a continued purchasing trend towards variable cost products and integrated solutions with low capital expenditure requirements and away from large capital equipment and other fixed cost solutions that are less likely to have costs recovered. 
We believe it is likely that many U.S. coal mines, coal-fired electric generating units, coal-centric large equipment providers and other coal-related businesses will have difficulty in adapting to industry changes expected in the coming years. However, we see opportunities for companies that can offer their customers creative and cost-effective solutions that help the U.S. coal-related businesses meet regulatory compliance, improve efficiency, lower costs and maintain reliability.
As of December 31, 2017, our primary products, services and RC technology licenses available to coal-fired electric generating units requiring solutions to assist with compliance with emissions standards included: 

• | Chemicals:


◦ | Our patented M-ProveTM ("M-Prove") technology, which is also incorporated in our RC technologies, that provides a cost effective alternative to other halogen-based, oxidation chemicals used to enhance removal of mercury emissions. M-Prove technology mitigates coal treatment corrosion risks to minimize maintenance and repair costs to enhance system reliability and risks associated with bromine discharge from plant wastewater; and 


◦ | Our RESPond® ("RESPond") liquid chemical additive that is a highly effective ash resistivity modifier for power plants operating cold-side electrostatic precipitators. Unlike Sulfur Trioxide ("SO3") solutions, the incumbent chemical being used to modify ash resistivity, the RESPond additive does not interfere with or reduce the effectiveness of activated carbon injected into the flue gas for purposes of reducing mercury emissions.


• | RC technology licenses:


◦ | Our patented CyCleanTM ("CyClean") technology, a pre-combustion coal treatment process that provides electric power generators the ability to enhance combustion and reduce emissions of NOX and mercury from coals burned in cyclone boilers; and 


◦ | Our patented M-45TM and patent pending M-45-PCTM technologies (collectively, the "M-45 Technology"), which are proprietary pre-combustion coal treatment technologies used to control emissions from circulating fluidized bed boilers and pulverized coal boilers, respectively.

4


• | Equipment:


◦ | Low capital expenditure mercury control technologies and systems such as Activated Carbon Injection ("ACI") systems, that effectively reduce mercury emissions over a broad range of plant configurations and coal types;


◦ | Dry Sorbent Injection systems ("DSI") that reduce emissions of Sulfur Dioxide ("SO2") and other acid gases such as SO3 and Hydrogen Chloride ("HC1"); and


◦ | Other equipment that may be necessary for longer term storage for consumable additives as well as our patented ADAirTM Mixer in-duct technology that alters flue gas flow to improve mixing and optimize particle dispersion to reduce sorbent consumption for ACI and DSI systems.


• | Consulting services and other:


◦ | We provide general consulting services as requested by our customers related to emissions control.

Additionally, we generate significant earnings from our investment in Tinuum Group. As of December 31, 2017, Tinuum Group, has built and placed into service a total of 28 RC facilities designed to produce RC for sale to coal-fired electric generating units. Coal-fired electric generating units use RC as one of a portfolio of tools to help comply with MATS and other environmental regulations. These RC facilities produce and sell RC that qualifies for Section 45 tax credits, including meeting the "placed in service" requirements (referred to as "placed in service"). The IRS has issued guidance regarding emissions reductions in the production of electricity by coal-fired electric generating units, including measurement and certification criteria necessary to qualify for the Section 45 tax credits. The ability to produce and sell RC, which generates Section 45 tax credits, expires 10 years after each RC facility is placed in service, but not later than December 31, 2021. Two of Tinuum Group's RC facilities were placed in service in 2009 and related Section 45 tax credits for these facilities substantially expire in December 2019. The Section 45 tax credits related to the remaining RC facilities expire in 2021.
Once an RC facility is in operation, Tinuum Group may lease or sell it to a tax equity investor, which we refer to as an "invested" RC facility. The tax equity investor subsequently operates the RC facility to produce and sell RC to a utility. It is financially advantageous for Tinuum Group to lease or sell an RC facility as the tax equity investor assumes the operating expenses for the RC facility and pays to Tinuum Group either an up-front payment to purchase or lease payments to lease the RC facility. We benefit from equity income and distributions accruing through our investment in Tinuum Group. Tax equity investors may benefit from their investment in RC facilities through the realization of tax assets and credits from the production and sale of RC.
RC facilities that are producing and selling RC and have not been leased or sold, are referred to as "retained" RC facilities, whereby the RC is produced and sold by Tinuum Group and, as an owner, we benefit from the related Section 45 tax benefits. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the Section 45 tax credits were $6.91 and $6.81 per ton of RC produced and sold to a utility. The value of the Section 45 tax credits is adjusted annually based on inflation adjustment factors published in the Federal Register. As of December 31, 2017, we have received, but have not been able to fully utilize, substantial tax credits and benefits from certain retained RC facilities that previously produced and sold RC for the benefit of Tinuum Group. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" ("Item 8") of this Report for additional information regarding our net operating losses, tax credits and other deferred tax assets. 
As of December 31, 2017, Tinuum Group had 17 invested RC facilities producing RC at utility sites and no retained RC facilities. The remaining 11 RC facilities, although placed in service, were either installed but not operating, awaiting site selection or in various other stages of contract negotiation or permanent installation. 
The RC facilities producing and selling RC as of December 31, 2017 are generally operated by Tinuum Services under operating and maintenance agreements with the owners or lessees of the RC facilities. 
Segment Information 
As of December 31, 2017, our operations consisted of two reportable segments: (1) RC and (2) EC.
Financial information related to each of our reportable segments is set forth in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 
5


(1) | RC Segment

Our RC segment derives its earnings from equity method investments as well as royalty payment streams and other revenues related to reduced emissions of both NOX and mercury from coal treated with our proprietary chemicals and burned at coal-fired electric generating units. Our equity method investments related to the RC segment include Tinuum Group, Tinuum Services and GWN Manager. 
Tinuum Group owns, leases or sells facilities used in the production of RC. The RC facilities are located at coal-fired generation stations owned by regulated utilities, cooperatives, government agencies and wholesale power generators (collectively, "Generators"). The RC produced by the RC facilities is used by the Generators as fuel in the coal-fired boilers to produce electricity. For invested RC facilities, Tinuum Group collects lease income from the lessee if leased, or sales proceeds from the buyer if sold. We benefit from these transactions through our equity method investment in Tinuum Group. RC facilities that are producing RC, but that Tinuum Group has not leased or sold, are referred to as retained RC facilities. Tinuum Group produces and sells RC to Generators and the owners of Tinuum Group, including us, may benefit to the extent Section 45 tax credits and other tax benefits are realized from the operation of retained RC facilities. 
Tinuum Services operates and maintains RC facilities under operating and maintenance agreements with Tinuum Group and owners or lessees of RC facilities. Tinuum Group or the owners or lessees of the RC facilities pay Tinuum Services, subject to certain limitations, the costs of operating and maintaining the RC facilities plus various fees. Tinuum Services also arranges for the purchase and delivery of certain chemical additives under chemical agency agreements, which include the chemicals required for our CyClean, and M-45 Technologies, necessary for the production of RC. The term of each chemical agency agreement runs concurrently with the respective RC facility's sale or lease agreement. 
We also earn royalties from the licensing of our M-45 Technology ("M-45 License") to Tinuum Group. Royalties are recognized based upon a percentage of the per-ton, pre-tax margin as defined in the M-45 License. 
Key drivers to RC segment performance and cash distributions are the number of operating (leased or sold) versus retained RC facilities, production and sale of RC and royalty-bearing tonnage. 
Refined Coal Data
The following table provides summary information related to the Company's investment in Tinuum Group and the related RC facilities as of December 31, 2017 and tons of RC produced and sold for the year ended December 31, 2017:
 | | | | Operating
 | # of RC Facilities | Not Operating | | Invested | Retained
RC Facilities | 28 | | 11 | | 17 | | (1) | —
RC tons produced and sold (000's) | | | | 46,887 | | 1,187 | 

(1) One RC facility is approximately 50% invested with an independent third party. The remaining approximate 50% is retained by Tinuum Group and the Company.
Additional information related to RC facilities is included in Item 7 - "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" ("Item 7") of this Report.

(2) | EC Segment


(a) | Systems & Equipment- Activated Carbon Injection, Dry Sorbent Injection System and Other Systems

Historically, our EC segment included revenues and related expenses from the sale of ACI and DSI equipment systems, chemical sales, consulting services and other sales related to the reduction of emissions in the coal-fired electric generation process and the electric utility industry. Demand for ACI and DSI system contracts historically was driven by coal-fired power plant utilities that needed to comply with MATS and Maximum Achievable Control Technology Standards ("MACT"). As the deadline for these standards has passed, and customers have now implemented ACI, DSI and other large equipment systems as a component of their strategies to comply with applicable regulations, the Company does not anticipate entering into future long-term fixed price contracts for ACI or DSI systems. However, we may continue to provide smaller scale equipment products that may be needed by power generation units as part of their ongoing operations.
Currently, we are transforming ourselves into a consumable products-focused company to provide customers with emission reduction solutions within the mercury control consumables market. 
6


(b) | Chemicals

Current mercury control options include consumables that utilize powdered activated carbon (“PAC”), halogen and re-emissions technologies. These options provide coal-powered utilities and industrial boilers with mercury control solutions working in conjunction with ACI and DSI systems and other pollution control equipment, generally without the requirement for significant ongoing capital outlays. Our current proprietary chemical portfolio generally provides customers with halogen and flue gas conditioning technology options, which include M-Prove and RESPond, respectively. Currently, sales of these products comprise a small piece of the consumables market. Our current and future focus is to increase our market share within the consumables market, both organically and through potential acquisition(s). 
Our patented M-Prove pre-combustion coal treatment technology involves the application of chemicals to coal. This technology substantially reduces mercury emissions and also can reduce the amount of activated carbon or other sorbents used to meet regulatory mercury emission limits. The power industry is beginning to experience corrosion and wastewater issues in their plants that they attribute to the use of bromine to enhance the capture of mercury. 
We believe the key benefits of the M-Prove additive are as follows:

• | effective at extremely low treatment rates;


• | significantly reduces "balance-of-plant" risks attributed to other halogen-based coal treatments, including corrosion to air pre-heater baskets;


• | minimizes ancillary halogen emissions in the stack as well as fly ash and wastewater;


• | reduces sorbent consumption for ACI systems;


• | facilitates enhanced mercury removal by downstream pollution control devices;


• | supports fuel flexibility and potential for fuel cost savings.

We experienced higher demand for our M-Prove Technology in 2017 and we believe that related revenues will continue to increase in 2018 as plants gain experience with their mercury control systems and begin to optimize their strategy to reduce operational impacts, especially as they relate to corrosion and wastewater. In October 2012, we were awarded the first in a family of patents designed to protect this technology in the U.S., and are pursuing similar patents in various other countries.
We license certain emissions control technologies, including the M-Prove additive, to Tinuum Group for the production of RC to reduce emissions of both mercury and NOX from coal-fired boilers. We licensed our patented CyClean technology to Tinuum Group upon formation of the entity in 2006 for use with cyclone boilers for the life of the patents. In July 2012, we executed the M-45 License with Tinuum Group, which is effective for the duration that Section 45 tax credits are available. We believe these licenses will leverage Tinuum Group’s operating expertise and allow it the ability to provide and use either the CyClean or M-Prove Technologies to produce RC. Later in 2012, we made a technological advancement in the M-Prove Technology, which was incorporated in the M-45 License and allows it to be effective in “pulverized coal” (“PC”) boilers. In addition to the royalty payments we receive from Tinuum Group, the use of M-Prove Technology in the production of RC provides valuable operating data and validates the effectiveness of the M-Prove Technology in a range of coal-fired boilers. We expect this information will help in our sales process for the M-Prove Technology. We are in the early stages of selling M-Prove into the EC market and a portion of our current revenues in this offering include application tests of M-Prove at customer sites. 
We have deployed technologies for conditioning flue gas streams from coal-fired combustion sources and maybe used as an alternative to other mercury control products. Our flue gas conditioning chemicals, sold under the trade name RESPond®, allow existing air pollution control devices, such as electrostatic precipitators ("ESPs"), to operate more efficiently without the use of traditional SO3 additives, which have been shown to be detrimental to effective mercury control by partially negating the effectiveness of certain sorbents used to absorb mercury, including activated carbon. Such treatment of the flue gas stream allows for effective collection of fly ash particles that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere. The use of the proprietary chemical blends may help existing marginally sized ESPs continue to operate effectively when applied exclusively, or in combination with other chemicals such as hydrated lime, activated carbon products, or other high-resistivity materials. 

(c) | Consulting Services

Historically, we have provided consulting services to assist electric power generators, the electric utility industry and others in planning and implementing strategies to meet the new and increasing government emission standards requiring reductions in SO2, SO3, HC1, NOX, particulates, acid gases and mercury. We anticipate that consulting services revenue will continue to diminish as we shift our focus to selling in the emissions reduction consumables market.

Legislation and Environmental Regulations 
U.S. Federal Mercury and Air Toxic Standards (“MATS”) Affecting Electric Utility Steam Generating Units
On December 16, 2011, the U.S. EPA issued the final "MATS Rule," which took effect in April 2012. The EPA structured the MATS Rule as a MACT-based hazardous pollutant regulation applicable to coal and oil-fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units (“EGU”), which generate electricity via steam turbines and have a capacity of 25 megawatts or greater, and provide for, among other provisions, control of mercury and particulate matter and control of acid gases such as HCl and other Hazardous Air Pollutants ("HAPs"). Approximately 1,260 units were coal-fired EGUs. According to our estimates, the standard sets a limit that we believe requires the capture of up to 80-90% of the mercury in the coal burned in electric power generation boilers as measured at the exhaust stack outlet for most plants. The MACT standards are also known as National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAP"). Plants generally had four years to comply with the MATS Rule, and we estimate that, based on data reported to the EPA and conversations with plant operators, most plants were required to comply by April 2016 and implementation of the MATS Rule is largely complete. We estimate that 48% of the coal-fired EGUs that were operating in December 2011, when the MATS rule was finalized, have been permanently shut down, leaving approximately 650 EGUs in operation at the end of 2017.
In April 2017, a review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit of a “supplemental finding” associated with the cost benefit analysis of the MATS Rule conducted by EPA was stayed at the request of the current Administration. The court case continues to be stayed indefinitely, but the MATS Rule is still in force until the issue is resolved. The EPA has not issued any further official proceedings regarding MATS Rule. 
State Mercury and Air Toxics Regulations Affecting EGUs
In addition, certain states have their own mercury rules that are similar to or more stringent than the MATS Rule, and coal-fired electric generating units around the country are subject to consent decrees that require the control of acid gases and particulate matter, in addition to mercury emissions. Twenty-three states have mercury-specific rules that affect more than 283 generating units and more than 100 GW of generating capacity that were still operating at the end of 2017.
Effluent Limitation Guidelines
On September 30, 2015, the EPA set the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants. The final rule requires, among other things, zero discharge for fly ash transport water, and limits on mercury, arsenic, selenium, and nitrate from flue gas desulfurization ("FGD") wastewater (also known as "legacy wastewater"). In April 2017 the EPA Administrator announced his decision to reconsider the Effluent Limitations Guidelines ("ELG") Rule, and the U.S. Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit granted the motion to reconsider and placed the case in abeyance, which delayed the earliest compliance date from November 2018 to November 2020. In September 2017, the EPA indicated that plants would not need to comply before November 2020, with a possible extension of up to five years with state approval. Although halogens are not directly regulated in the effluent guidelines, some halogens may impact the effectiveness of biological wastewater treatment systems that are often used for the removal of selenium. We are evaluating whether the potential market opportunity supports our development of new products to help plants comply with these rules, as well as how these rules may affect our current product offerings.
Additional U.S. Legislation and Regulations
On August 3, 2015, the EPA finalized rules to reduced greenhouse gases ("GHGs") in the form of the CPP, which established guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to reduce GHG emissions. Under the CPP, states are required to prepare State Implementation Plans to meet state targets established based on emission reductions from affected sources. The CPP requires that the Best System of Emission Reduction ("BSER") be implemented and establishes three building blocks, which 
8

include heat rate improvements at affected coal-fired electric generating units, substituting coal-fired generation with less carbon-intensive EGUs such as natural gas combined cycle plants, and substituting renewable generation. The CPP has been challenged by multiple states in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ("DC Circuit"). The CPP is currently stayed by the Supreme Court, and a panel of 10 judges on the DC Circuit are reviewing the CPP following a hearing in September 2016. On October 10, 2017, the EPA announced a proposal to repeal the CPP. The DC Circuit has been holding CPP litigation in abeyance since April 28, 2017.
International Regulations
There are various international regulations related to mercury control. In Canada, the Canada-Wide Standard ("CWS") was initially implemented in 2010, with increasingly stringent limits through 2020 and with varying mercury caps for each province. China and Germany both have limits for mercury emissions that are less stringent than U.S. limits, which are typically met using co-benefits from other installed air pollution control equipment designed to control other pollutants. In May 2017, the EU ratified the Minimata Convention on Mercury, triggering mercury control regulations with implementation starting in 2021. Specific emissions limits are currently being developed guided by the best available technologies reference ("BREF") document for limiting stack emissions and liquid effluents from industrial processes. The BREF conclusions for large coal-fired electric generating units were adopted by the European Commission in July 2017.
Based upon the existing and potential regulations, we believe the international market for mercury control products may expand in the coming years, and we are positioning our patent portfolio and existing commercial products accordingly to be prepared if an international market for our products develops.
Competition 
In the EC consumables market, our mercury control chemicals primarily compete against the use of brominated PAC, as well as the use of bromine applied to the coal prior to combustion. Our primary competitors for our coal additives are Nalco Water, Ecolab Company, and Midwest Energy Emissions Corp ("MEEC"). As it relates to brominated PAC providers, our primary competitors include ADA Carbon Solutions, Cabot Corporation, and Calgon Carbon. 
In the RC market, we believe Chem-Mod, LLC ("Chem-Mod") and licensees of the Chem-Mod technology are our principal competitors. Competition within the RC market is based primarily on price, the number of tons of coal burned at the coal-fired electric generating unit where the RC facilities are operating and the tax compliance facts associated with each RC facility. Additionally, competition for tax equity investors extends into other investment opportunities, including opportunities related to potential tax incentive transactions available to potential investors.
Patents 
As of December 31, 2017, we held 38 U.S. patents and three international patents that were issued or allowed, 12 additional U.S. provisional patents or applications that were pending, and nine international patent applications that were either pending or filed relating to different aspects of our technology. Our existing patents generally have terms of 20 years from the date of filing, with our next patents expiring beginning in 2021. We consider many of our patents and pending patents to be critical to the ongoing conduct of our business. 
Our Vendors and Supply of Materials 
We purchase our proprietary chemicals through negotiated blending contracts that include confidentiality agreements with chemical suppliers. These arrangements attempt to assure continuous supply of our proprietary chemical blends. The manufacturing of our chemical products is dependent upon certain discrete chemicals that are subject to price fluctuations and supply constraints. In addition, the number of chemical suppliers who provide the necessary additives needed to manufacture our proprietary M-Prove and RESPond chemicals is limited. Supply agreements are generally renewed on an annual basis. 
Seasonality of Activities 
The sale of our chemical products and RC facility operation levels depend on the operations of the coal-fired electric generating units to which the applicable chemicals are provided and the location of the RC facilities, respectively. Coal-fired electric generating units routinely schedule maintenance outages in the spring and/or fall depending upon the operation of the boilers. During the period in which an outage may occur, which may range from one week to over a month, no chemicals are used or RC produced and sold, and our revenues can be correspondingly reduced. Additionally, power generation is weather dependent, with electricity and steam production varying in response to heating and cooling needs.
9

Dependence on Major Customers 
We depend on our customer relationships with owners and operators of coal-fired power electric generating units as well as general market demand for coal-fueled power generation. Additional information related to major customers is disclosed in Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 
Through our investment in Tinuum Group, we depend on our relationships with owners and operators of coal-fired power generation facilities, including various electric utilities and tax equity investors. Tinuum Group is the exclusive licensee for purposes of producing RC using the CyClean and M-45 Technologies. Tinuum Group depends on tax equity investors, with significant concentration within affiliates of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. These investors could renegotiate or terminate their leases, or the utilities where the RC facilities are installed could materially reduce their use of RC.
Research and Development Activities 
During 2017, we focused on pursuing the expansion of potential product offerings within the emissions reduction consumables market to complement our existing chemical solutions. Historically, we engaged in research and development activities that would bring the broader technologies to the EC market and expand our own offerings, including CO2 capture technology. This research and development was funded, in part, under contracts and/or cost reimbursement arrangements with the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") and other third parties.
Backlog
Backlog represents the dollar amount of revenues we expect to recognize in the future from fixed-price contracts, primarily for ACI and DSI systems as well as certain fixed-price chemical contracts that have been executed, but work has not commenced, and those that are currently in progress. A project is included within backlog when a contract is executed. Backlog amounts include anticipated revenues associated with the original contract amounts, executed change orders, and any claims that may be outstanding with customers. It does not include contracts that are in the bidding stage or have not been awarded. As a result, we believe the backlog figures are firm, subject to customer modifications, alterations or cancellation provisions contained in the various contracts. 
Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results. Estimates of profitability could increase or decrease based on changes in direct materials, labor and subcontractor costs, and indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools and repairs, and any claims with customers. Backlog is not a measure defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and is not a measure of profitability. Our method for calculating backlog may not be comparable to methodologies used by other companies.

Based on our adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASU 2014-09") on January 1, 2018, all the equipment system contracts that are included in backlog as of December 31, 2017, and costs related thereto, will be recognized through a balance sheet adjustment on January 1, 2018, and will not impact our earnings in 2018. All material backlog will be recognized as a balance sheet adjustment on January 1, 2018.
Operating Locations
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had domestic operations located in Colorado.
