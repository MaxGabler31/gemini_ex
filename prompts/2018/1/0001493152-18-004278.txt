General 
 
Houston American Energy Corp is an independent oil and gas company focused on the development, exploration, exploitation, acquisition, and production of natural gas and crude oil properties. Our principal properties, and operations, are in the U.S. Permian (Delaware) Basin. Additionally, we have properties in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, particularly Texas and Louisiana, and in the South American country of Colombia.
 
We focus on early identification of, and opportunistic entrance into, existing and emerging resource plays. We do not operate properties but typically seek to partner with, or invest along-side, larger operators in the development of resources or retain interests, with or without contribution on our part, in prospects identified, packaged and promoted to larger operators. By entering these plays earlier, identifying stranded blocks and partnering with, investing along-side or promoting to, larger operators, we believe we can capture larger resource potential at lower cost and minimize our exposure to drilling risks and costs and ongoing operating costs.
 
We, along with our partners, actively manage our resources through opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures where reserves can be identified, developed, monetized and financial resources redeployed with the objective of growing reserves, production and shareholder value.
 
Properties
 
Our exploration and development projects are focused on existing property interests, and future acquisition of additional property interests, in the Texas Permian Basin, the onshore Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast region and in the South American country of Colombia.
 
Each of our property interests differ in scope and character and consists of one or more types of assets, such as 3-D seismic data, leasehold positions, lease options, working interests in leases, partnership or limited liability company interests, corporate equity interests or other mineral rights. Our percentage interest in each property represents the portion of the interest in the property we share with other partners in the property. Because each property consists of a bundle of assets that may or may not include a working interest in the project, our stated interest in a property simply represents our proportional ownership in the bundle of assets that constitute the property. Therefore, our interest in a property should not be confused with the working interest that we will own when a given well is drilled. Each of our exploration and development projects represents a negotiated transaction between the project partners relating to one or more properties. Our working interest may be higher or lower than our stated interest.

- United States Properties: 
 
In the United States, our properties and operations are principally located in the on-shore Permian (Delaware) Basin and Gulf Coast regions of Louisiana and Texas.
 
Texas Properties 
 
Reeves County. Our principal exploration properties in Texas covers 960 gross acres in Reeves County, Texas, in which we hold an 18.6% average working interest, consisting of (1) the 320 gross acre Johnson Lease, in which we hold a 25% working interest, subject to a proportionate 5% back-in after payout, and (2) the 640 gross acre O’Brien Lease, in which we hold an average 15.489% working interest. Our Reeves County acreage lies within the Delaware sub-basin of the Permian Basin, with resource potential in the Wolfcamp, Bone Spring and Avalon formations. During 2017, we drilled and completed our initial wells on both lease blocks, the Johnson State #1H well and the O’Brien #3H well, both horizontally drilled and hydraulically fractured wells in the Wolfcamp A formation. Our near term operations are focused on implementation of a multi-well program of horizontally drilled and hydraulically fractured wells on our existing Reeves County acreage and other acreage we may acquire in Reeves County. Founders Oil & Gas, LLC serves as operator on all of our current Reeves County acreage.
 
Other Properties. We hold a 25% mineral interest in 146 gross acres in Live Oak County, Texas, including 1 productive well. We have no present plans to conduct additional drilling operations on such acreage.

- Colombian Properties: 
 
At December 31, 2017, we held interests in multiple prospects in Colombia covering 392,205 gross acres. We identify our Colombian prospects by the concessions operated.
 
The following table sets forth information relating to our interests in prospects in Colombia at December 31, 2017:
 

Property | Operator | Ownership Interest | | | Total Gross Acres | | Total Gross Developed Acres | Gross Productive Wells 
-------------+----------+------------------------+------+---+-----------------------+---------+---------------------------------+---------------------------
Los Picachos | Hupecol | | 12.5 | % | | 86,235 | | — | —
Macaya | Hupecol | | 12.5 | % | | 195,201 | | — | —
Serrania | Hupecol | | 12.5 | % | | 110,769 | | — | —
Total | | | | | | 392,205 | | — | —

 
At December 31, 2017, we held interests in three concessions operated by Hupecol Operating Co. in Colombia. The Loc Picachos, Macaya and Serrania concessions are located in the Caguan Putumayo Basin of Colombia. The concessions cover an aggregate area of 392,205 acres. Our interest in each of the concessions is subject to an escalating royalty ranging from 8% to 20% depending upon production volumes and pricing and an additional 6% to 10% per concession when 5,000,000 barrels of oil have been produced on a field in a concession.
 
As of December 31, 2017, no wells had been drilled and no production had taken place on any of the fields in our then existing concessions in Colombia.
 
As operator of our various prospects, Hupecol has substantial control over the timing of drilling and selection of prospects to be drilled and we have limited ability to influence the selection of prospects to be drilled or the timing of such drilling operations and have no effective means of controlling the costs of such drilling operations. Accordingly, our drilling budget is subject to fluctuation based on the prospects selected to be drilled by Hupecol, the decisions of Hupecol regarding timing of such drilling operations and the ability of Hupecol to drill and operate wells within estimated budgets.
 
Commencement of drilling of each of our concessions has been delayed on multiple occasions, and continues to be delayed, due to numerous factors of a political nature, including conflicts between federal and local authorities over environmental and permitting issues and lingering security concerns arising from the long-standing conflict between the federal government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, also known as FARC.
 
In June 2016, a peace accord was announced between the Colombian government and FARC. The peace accord was ultimately rejected in a popular referendum although both government and FARC representatives have indicated a desire to cease all hostilities and seek to arrive at an acceptable final peace accord. While there is no assurance as to how the peace initiative will, or will not, impact our assets, we continue to evaluate our plans regarding our Colombian assets in light of the peace initiatives and the potential of the same to enhance our prospects of arriving at a favorable resolution to the impasse that has prevented the commencement of drilling operations on our Colombian properties.
 
Serrania Block
 
Our interest in the Serrania concession was acquired through a Farmout Agreement with the original operator of the block pursuant to which we will pay 25% of designated Phase 1 geological and seismic costs in return for a 12.5% interest in the Contract for Exploration and Production covering the concession.
 
Seismic work on the Serrania Block was completed in 2010. Drilling preparation and seismic processing work was performed in 2011 and 2012 in connection with the planned drilling of initial test wells on the concession. The National Hydrocarbon Agency of Colombia (the “ANH”) has granted extensions of required development commitments, including drilling of a first test well on the Serrania concession, until conditions in the area allow operations.

During 2017, Hupecol continued to experience opposition, at the local level, to their efforts to secure necessary permits to commence drilling operations on the Serrania block. The federal government, which originally granted the concession, granted necessary permits to commence drilling and subsequently rescinded the permits. Given the ongoing opposition, Hupecol has determined to defer further efforts to commence drilling on the block for the foreseeable future and has commenced discussions with the ANH with a view to arriving at a final definitive settlement either permitting drilling or compensating Hupecol for the block.
 
Los Picachos and Macaya Prospects
 
Our Los Picachos and Macaya prospects adjoin our Serrania concession. Hupecol has advised us that they have put on hold plans to begin seismic and other work on the Los Picachos and Macaya concessions until a satisfactory resolution of the ongoing permitting disputes. The ANH has granted extensions of required development commitments, including seismic acquisition, until conditions in the area allow operations.
Drilling Activity 
 
During 2017, we drilled two wells. The following table summarizes the number of wells drilled during 2017, 2016, and 2015, excluding any wells drilled under farmout agreements, royalty interest ownership, or any other wells in which we do not have a working interest.

Productive wells are wells that are found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of the production exceed production expenses and taxes.
 
Both of the wells drilled during 2017 were classified as exploratory wells on our Reeves County, Texas acreage and both were horizontally drilled, hydraulically fractured and successfully completed in the Wolfcamp formation.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had no wells in progress or awaiting hook up.
 
Productive Wells 
 
Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including shut-in wells. A well bore with multiple completions is counted as only one well. As of December 31, 2017, we owned interests in 10 gross wells. As of December 31, 2017, we had ownership interests in productive wells, categorized by geographic area, as follows:

Natural Gas and Oil Reserves 
 
Reserve Estimates 
 
The following tables sets forth, by country and as of December 31, 2017, our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves, and the estimated present value (discounted at an annual rate of 10%) of estimated future net revenues before future income taxes (“PV-10”) and after future income taxes (“Standardized Measure”) of our proved reserves, each prepared in accordance with assumptions prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 
The PV-10 value is a widely used measure of value of oil and natural gas assets and represents a pre-tax present value of estimated cash flows discounted at ten percent. PV-10 is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC. We believe that our PV-10 presentation is relevant and useful to our investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account the related future income taxes, as such taxes may differ among various companies because of differences in the amounts and timing of deductible basis, net operating loss carry forwards and other factors. We believe investors and creditors use our PV-10 as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to the reserve estimates of other companies. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP and is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP.

(1) | In accordance with applicable financial accounting and reporting standards of the SEC, the estimates of our proved reserves and the PV-10 set forth herein reflect estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development costs, using prices and costs under existing economic conditions at December 31, 2017. For purposes of determining prices, we used the unweighted arithmetical average of the prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017. The average prices utilized for purposes of estimating our proved reserves were $48.14 per barrel of oil and $3.048 per mcf of natural gas for our US properties, adjusted by property for energy content, quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials. The prices should not be interpreted as a prediction of future prices. The amounts shown do not give effect to non-property related expenses, such as corporate general administrative expenses and debt service, future income taxes or to depreciation, depletion and amortization.

(2) | Natural gas is converted on the basis of six Mcf of gas per one barrel of oil equivalent. 
(3) | The Standard Measure differs from PV-10 only in that the Standard Measure reflects estimated future income taxes. 

 
Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, proved reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available. The estimates of reserves, future cash flows and present value are based on various assumptions, including those prescribed by the SEC, and are inherently imprecise. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual future production, cash flows, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates.
 
Reserve Estimation Process, Controls and Technologies
 
The reserve estimates, including PV-10 and Standard Measure estimates, set forth above were prepared by Russell K. Hall & Associates, Inc. for our Reeves County, Texas, reserves and by Lonquist & Co., LLC for all other reserves.
 
These calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with SEC financial accounting and reporting standards.

Our year-end reserve reports are prepared by reserve engineering firms based upon a review of property interests being appraised, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, geosciences and engineering data, and other information provided to them by our management team. Russell K. Hall & Associates also prepares reserve estimates for Founders Oil & Gas, the operator of our Reeves County properties. Lonquist & Co. also prepares reserve estimates for the various Hupecol entities. Upon analysis and evaluation of data provided, the reserve engineering firms issue a preliminary appraisal report of our reserves. The preliminary appraisal report and changes in our reserves are reviewed by our President for reasonableness of the results obtained. Once any questions have been addressed, the reserve engineering firms issue final appraisal reports, reflecting their conclusions.
 
Russell K. Hall & Associates is an independent Midland, Texas based professional engineering firm providing reserve evaluation services to the oil and gas industry. Their report was prepared under the direction of Russell K. Hall, founder and President of Russell K. Hall & Associates. Mr. Hall holds a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Oklahoma, is a registered professional engineer and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the Society of Independent Professional Earth Scientists and the West Texas Geological Society. Mr. Hall has more than 30 years of experience in reserve evaluation for the oil and gas industry and the oil and gas finance industry. Russell K. Hall & Associates, and its employees, have no interest in our company or our properties and were objective in determining our reserves.
 
Lonquist & Co. is an independent professional engineering firm specializing in the technical and financial evaluation of oil and gas assets. Lonquist & Co’s report was conducted under the direction of Don E. Charbula, P.E., Vice President of Lonquist & Co. Mr. Charbula holds a BS in Petroleum Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin and is a registered professional engineer with more than 30 years of experience in production engineering, reservoir engineering, acquisitions and divestments, field operations and management. Lonquist & Co., and its employees, have no interest in our Company and were objective in determining our reserves.
 
The SEC’s rules with respect to technologies that a company can use to establish reserves allows use of techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
 
Our reserve engineering firms used a combination of production and pressure performance, simulation studies, offset analogies, seismic data and interpretation, geophysical logs and core data to calculate our reserves estimates.
 
Proved Undeveloped Reserves 
 
The following table summarizes activity within our proved undeveloped reserve category for the year ended December 31, 2017:

Proved undeveloped reserves (MBoe): | | 
Beginning of year | | — 
Extensions and discoveries | | 437,797
End of year | | 437,797

 
At December 31, 2017, all proved undeveloped reserves were attributable to our 2017 drilling operations on our Reeves County, Texas acreage. We expect to develop all of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2017 within five years of their initial booking.

Developed and Undeveloped Acreage 
 
The following table sets forth the gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage (including both leases and concessions), categorized by geographical area, which we held as of December 31, 2017:

 | Developed | | Undeveloped
--------------+-----------+-------+------------
 | Gross | | Net | | Gross | Net 
United States | | 2,899 | | 294 | | 320 | 63 
Colombia | | — | | — | | 392,205 | 49,025
Total | | 2,899 | | 294 | | 392,525 | 49,088

 
Developed acreage is comprised of leased acres that are within an area spaced by or assignable to a productive well. Undeveloped acreage is comprised of leased acres with defined remaining terms and not within an area spaced by or assignable to a productive well.
 
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we can generally retain our interest in undeveloped acreage by drilling activity that establishes commercial production sufficient to maintain the leases or by paying delay rentals during the remaining primary term of leases. The oil and natural gas leases in which we have an interest are for varying primary terms and, if production under a lease continues from our developed lease acreage beyond the primary term, we are entitled to hold the lease for as long as oil or natural gas is produced.
 
Many of the leases and concessions comprising the undeveloped acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless production from the acreage has been established prior to such date, in which event the lease or concession will remain in effect until the cessation of production. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2017, the expiration periods of the gross and net acres that are subject to leases or concessions summarized in the above table of undeveloped acreage.

Title to Properties 
 
Title to properties is subject to royalty, overriding royalty, carried working, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the gas and oil industry, liens for current taxes not yet due and other encumbrances. As is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition (other than preliminary review of local records).
 
Investigation, including a title opinion of local counsel, generally is made before commencement of drilling operations.
 
Marketing 
 
At December 31, 2017, we had no contractual agreements to sell our gas and oil production and all production was sold on spot markets.
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 3 full-time employees and no part time employees. The employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we do not anticipate that any of our future employees will be covered by such agreements.

Competition
 
We encounter intense competition from other oil and gas companies in all areas of our operations, including the acquisition of producing properties and undeveloped acreage. Our competitors include major integrated oil and gas companies, numerous independent oil and gas companies and individuals. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources and have been engaged in the oil and gas business for a much longer time than our Company. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties, exploratory prospects and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.
Regulatory Matters 
 
Regulation of Oil and Gas Production, Sales and Transportation 
 
The oil and gas industry is subject to regulation by numerous national, state and local governmental agencies and departments. Compliance with these regulations is often difficult and costly and noncompliance could result in substantial penalties and risks. Most jurisdictions in which we operate also have statutes, rules, regulations or guidelines governing the conservation of natural resources, including the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, minimum well spacing, plugging and abandonment of wells and the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells. Some jurisdictions also require the filing of drilling and operating permits, bonds and reports. The failure to comply with these statutes, rules and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties and the suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas.
Environmental Regulation 
 
Various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including the discharge of materials into the environment, may affect our exploration, development and production operations and the costs of those operations. These laws and regulations, among other things, govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment, the issuance of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations, the discharge and disposition of generated waste materials and waste management, the reclamation and abandonment of wells, sites and facilities, financial assurance and the remediation of contaminated sites. These laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for noncompliance and for any contamination resulting from our operations and may require the suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas.
 
The environmental laws and regulations applicable to our U.S. operations include, among others, the following United States federal laws and regulations:
 

● | Clean Air Act, and its amendments, which govern air emissions; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Clean Water Act, which governs discharges into waters of the United States; 
● | Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which imposes liability where hazardous releases have occurred or are threatened to occur (commonly known as “Superfund”); 
● | Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs the management of solid waste; 
● | Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which imposes liabilities resulting from discharges of oil into navigable waters of the United States; 
● | Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which requires reporting of toxic chemical inventories; 
● | Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the underground injection and disposal of wastewater; and 
● | U.S. Department of Interior regulations, which impose liability for pollution cleanup and damages. 

 
Colombia has similar laws and regulations designed to protect the environment.
 
We routinely obtain permits for our facilities and operations in accordance with these applicable laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. There are no known issues that have a significant adverse effect on the permitting process or permit compliance status of any of our facilities or operations.
 

11
--

 

The ultimate financial impact of these environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determined as new standards are enacted and new interpretations of existing standards are rendered. Environmental laws and regulations are expected to have an increasing impact on our operations. In addition, any non-compliance with such laws could subject us to material administrative, civil or criminal penalties, or other liabilities. Potential permitting costs are variable and directly associated with the type of facility and its geographic location. Costs, for example, may be incurred for air emission permits, spill contingency requirements, and discharge or injection permits. These costs are considered a normal, recurring cost of our ongoing operations and not an extraordinary cost of compliance with government regulations.
 
Although we do not operate the properties in which we hold interests, noncompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations by the operators of our oil and gas properties could expose us, and our properties, to potential costs and liabilities associated with such environmental laws. While we exercise no oversight with respect to any of our operators, we believe that each of our operators is committed to environmental protection and compliance. However, since environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and in the operations of companies engaged in similar businesses and since regulatory requirements frequently change and may become more stringent, there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future. Such costs may result in increased costs of operations and acquisitions and decreased production.
 
Hydraulic Fracturing Regulation
 
Hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking”, is a common practice used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas from tight formations, including shales. Fracking involves the injection of fluids—usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of chemical additives—as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore.
 
Except as applies to federal lands, fracking generally is exempt from regulation under many federal environmental rules and is generally regulated at the state level.
 
For example, in Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission administers regulations related to oil and gas operations, including regulations pertaining to protection of water resources in connection with those operations. The Texas Legislature adopted new legislation requiring oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, effective as of September 1, 2011. The Texas Railroad Commission has adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the Railroad Commission issues an initial drilling permit after February 1, 2012. This law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the Texas Railroad Commission with the well completion report. The total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the Texas Railroad Commission.
 
There has been increasing public controversy regarding fracking with regard to the use of fracking fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level, fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause operators to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on well operations and economics.
 
We do not operate wells but contract well operations to third party operators. Operators of our wells may perform fracking operations, or contract third parties to perform such operations, on wells in which we participate. Many newer wells would not be economical without the use of fracking to stimulate production from the well. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing.

Climate Change Legislation and Greenhouse Gas Regulation 
 
Federal, state and local laws and regulations are increasingly being enacted to address concerns about the effects the emission of “greenhouse gases” may have on the environment and climate worldwide. These effects are widely referred to as “climate change.” Since its December 2009 endangerment finding regarding the emission of greenhouse gases, the EPA has begun regulating sources of greenhouse gas emissions under the federal Clean Air Act. Among several regulations requiring reporting or permitting for greenhouse gas sources, the EPA finalized its “tailoring rule” in May 2010 that determines which stationary sources of greenhouse gases are required to obtain permits to construct, modify or operate on account of, and to implement the best available control technology for, their greenhouse gases. In November 2010, the EPA also finalized its greenhouse gas reporting requirements, beginning in March 2012, for certain oil and gas production facilities.
 
Moreover, in recent past the U.S. Congress has considered establishing a cap-and-trade program to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases. Under past proposals, the EPA would issue or sell a capped and steadily declining number of tradable emissions allowances to certain major sources of greenhouse gas emissions so that such sources could continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These allowances would be expected to escalate significantly in cost over time. The net effect of such legislation, if ever adopted, would be to impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon-based fuels such as crude oil, refined petroleum products, and natural gas. In addition, while the prospect for such cap-and-trade legislation by the U.S. Congress remains uncertain, several states have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, similar cap-and-trade programs.
 
As a crude oil and natural gas company, the debate on climate change is relevant to our operations because the equipment we use to explore for, develop and produce crude oil and natural gas emits greenhouse gases. Additionally, the combustion of carbon-based fuels, such as the crude oil and natural gas we sell, emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Thus, any current or future federal, state or local climate change initiatives could adversely affect demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce by stimulating demand for alternative forms of energy that do not rely on the combustion of fossil fuels, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although our compliance with any greenhouse gas regulations may result in increased compliance and operating costs, we do not expect the compliance costs for currently applicable regulations to be material. Moreover, while it is not possible at this time to estimate the compliance costs or operational impacts for any new legislative or regulatory developments in this area, we do not anticipate being impacted to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors.
