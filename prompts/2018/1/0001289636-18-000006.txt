Item 1. Business
Overview
Profire is an oilfield technology company, providing products that enhance the efficiency, safety, and compliance of the oil and gas industry. We specialize in the creation of burner-management systems used on a variety of oilfield forced-air and natural-draft fire tube vessels. We sell our products and services primarily throughout North America. Our experienced team of industry service professionals also provides supporting services for our products. We were originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 5, 2003. Since October 2008, we have been primarily engaged in the business of developing burner-management technologies for the oil and gas industry.
Principal Products and Services
In the oil and natural gas industry, there are numerous demands for heat generation and control.  Oilfield vessels of all kinds, including line-heaters, dehydrators, separators, treaters, amine reboilers, and free-water knockout systems require heat to satisfy their various functions, which is provided by a burner flame inside the vessel.  This burner flame is integral to the operation of the vessel because these vessels use the flame's heat to facilitate the proper function of the vessel. Such functions include separating, storing, transporting and purifying oil and gas (or even water).  For example, the viscosity of oil and moisture content (and temperature) of gas are critical to a number of oilfield processes, and are directly affected by the heat provided by the burner flame inside the vessel. Our burner-management systems help ignite, monitor, and manage this burner flame, reducing the need for employee interaction with the burner, such as for the purposes of re-ignition or temperature monitoring.
As a result, oil and gas producers can achieve increased safety, greater operational efficiencies, and improved compliance with industry regulations.  We believe there is a growing trend in the oil and gas industry toward enhanced control, process automation, and data logging, partly for potential regulatory-satisfaction purposes. We believe that enhanced burner-management products and services can help our customers be compliant with such regulatory requirements, where applicable. In addition to selling products, we train and dispatch service technicians to service burner flame installations in Canada and throughout the United States.
We initially developed our first burner-management system in 2005. Since 2005, we have released several iterations of our initial burner-management system to increase features and capabilities, while maintaining compliance with Canadian Standards Association (CSA) and Underwriters Laboratories (UL) ratings.
Our burner-management systems have become widely used in Western Canada, and throughout many regions in the United States. We have sold our burner-management systems to many large energy companies, including Anadarko, Chesapeake Energy, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, Encana, Exxon-Mobil, Petro-Canada, Shell and others.  Our systems have also been sold or installed in other parts of the world, including France, Italy, Ukraine, India, Nigeria, the Middle East, Australia, and Brazil. While we have an interest in expanding our international distribution capabilities, our current principal focus is on the North American oil and gas market.
 Recent Product Extension: PF3100
In September 2015, the Company unveiled its next generation burner-management system which is designed to operate, monitor, and control more complex, multi-faceted oilfield applications. The PF3100 is an advanced management system designed to work with a number of Profire-engineered modules, specific to different applications, thus allowing the system to expertly manage a wide variety of applications.
Throughout the industry, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are used to operate and manage custom-built oilfield applications. Though capable, PLCs can be expensive, tedious, and difficult to use. Our unique solution, the PF3100, helps manage and synchronize custom applications, allowing oilfield producers to meet more deadlines and improve profitability through an off-the-shelf solution with dynamic customization.  The Company is selling the PF3100 for use in the oil and gas industry's natural-draft and forced-air markets.
The Company frequently assesses market needs by participating in industry conferences, soliciting feedback from existing and potential customers, and looking for opportunities to provide quality solutions to the oil and gas producing companies it serves. Upon identifying a potential market need, the Company begins researching the market and developing products that might be feasible for future sale.

Additional Complementary Products
In addition to our burner-management systems, we also sell complementary oilfield products to help facilitate improved oilfield safety and efficiency. Such products help manage fuel flow (e.g., valves and fuel-trains), meter air flow (e.g., airplates), generate power on-site (e.g., solar packages), ignite and direct flame (e.g., flare stack igniter and nozzles), and other necessary functions. We continue to develop innovative complementary products, which we anticipate will help bolster continued long-term growth. Some of the complementary products we sell are purchased from third parties (e.g., solar packages), while some are proprietary (e.g., flare stack igniter) or patent-pending (e.g. inline pilot and valve technologies).

Chemical-Management Systems
Chemical injection is used for a wide variety of purposes in the oil and gas industry including down-hole inhibition of wax, hydrates, and corrosion agents, to allow product to flow more efficiently to the wellhead. Once at the wellhead, chemical injection can also be used to further process the oil or gas before it is sent into a pipeline, and with other applications.
Currently, a variety of pumps are available in the market that can be used to meter the chemicals injected, but most are often inaccurate in injecting the proper amount of chemical as they may not account for all of the variables that affect how much chemical should be injected (e.g., pressure, hydrogen sulfide concentration, etc.), nor the optimal efficiency rates of varying pump systems.
Inaccurate injection levels are problematic because the chemicals injected are expensive, and over-injection causes unnecessary expense for producers. Under-injection can also be problematic because it often results in the creation of poor product (i.e., with wax, hydrate, or corrosion agents), and causes problems with pipeline audits.
Our chemical-management systems monitor and manage the chemical-injection process to ensure that optimal levels of chemicals are injected. This improves pump efficiency and production quality of the well. Our chemical-management systems also reduce the risk of exposure to chemicals, which results in increased worker safety and greater compliance with pipeline regulations. Like our burner-management systems, our chemical-management systems can be monitored and managed remotely via SCADA or other remote-communication systems. We hold a U.S. patent related to our chemical management system and its process for supplying a chemical agent to a process fluid.
Principal Markets and Distribution Methods
Our principal markets include Canada and the United States, specifically the Marcellus, Permian, Bakken, STACK, SCOOP, and Eagle Ford areas. In our experience, the oil and gas industry does not typically centralize purchasing decisions of relatively inexpensive products and services like those we provide. Therefore, we place a strong emphasis on developing relationships with customers at the field-level. Because of this relationship-based purchasing structure, most of our sales are made directly to producers rather than through distributors.
We have also had success in working with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who manufacture the production and processing equipment on which our products are utilized. These products can be used in new wells or as replacements for former old or defective products. In addition, we have had success in working with strategic partners that deliver instrumentation and electrical (I&E) services in the industry. When drilling activity is high, these OEMs and I&Es provide us with a relatively easy-to-scale sales channel.
In addition to developing a larger presence in international markets in future years, we believe the PF3100 platform will serve as the base for applications outside of the oil and gas industry (as well as for new applications within the oil and gas industry). Although our primary focus is on serving the oil and gas industry, we continue to look for opportunities to expand and diversify our product footprint to other industries. For example, the PF3100 could have applications in the agricultural industry. We intend to continue to explore these opportunities.
Competition
We believe most of our competitors have limited sales and service departments to promote and support their products. Most of our competitors are regionally focused, with operations that are limited to areas close to their headquarters. There are several companies marketing burner-management products similar to ours. Our direct competitors include Combustex, SureFire, Platinum, and ACL.

While price is a significant method of competition within our industry, we believe the most important competitive factors are performance, quality, reliability, durability, and installation/service expertise. To that end, we have primarily sought to first create high-quality and innovative products, then to constrain costs without compromising those primary characteristics. Relative to our competition, we believe our product-offering tends to be about average in price, but with above-average capability, reliability, and product-support.
We believe this quality-focused approach will help us continue to remain competitive in the industry. To help assure our customers of our commitment to quality and safety, our burner-management systems have been certified to comply with CSA and UL ratings. Additionally, because we were an early-mover in the burner-management market, we have the advantage of established relationships with both suppliers and customers, which help create a barrier to new entrants.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We operate under release date purchase orders with the majority of our suppliers. This allows for our procurement team to work closely with our suppliers to navigate the market fluctuations and the changing needs of our customers. In the past, we have not experienced any sudden or dramatic increase in the prices of the major parts or components needed for our systems. However, as the industry activity increases, there could be greater upward pressure on the price of system components.
Some of the components that we resell, such as some of our valve products, are available from a limited number of suppliers. If our access to such products became constricted, we could experience a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. We continue to develop proprietary products that could reduce some of our dependency on these limited componentry items. As we anticipate continued development of proprietary products, we expect to review vendor relationships to help ensure we are working with suppliers that best meet our needs and the needs of our customers. Because many of the component parts we use are relatively low-priced and readily available, we do not anticipate that a sudden or dramatic increase in the price (or decrease in supply) of any particular part would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, even if we were unable to increase our sales prices proportionate to any particular price increase.
We contract with a third-party fabricator, Logican Technologies, to manufacture our burner-management and chemical-management systems, along with other proprietary products. We believe this has provided us with improved manufacturing efficiencies. Additionally, the use of a third-party fabricator enables us to concentrate our capital on liquidity maintenance, research and development projects, and other strategies that align with our core competencies instead of investments in manufacturing equipment. Under the direction of our product engineers, the manufacturer is able to procure all electronic parts, specialty cases and components, and from those components assemble the complete system. Using specialty equipment and processes provided by us, the system is tested on-site by the manufacturer, and if the finished product is acceptable, it is shipped to us for distribution. We subsequently perform our own quality-control testing, and ensure the programming for each system is ready for the anticipated environment of the customer. Shipments to us from our manufacturer are usually limited to approximately 300 systems, so that in the event any one shipment is lost or damaged, inventory levels are not seriously impacted. The entire manufacturing process is typically completed within 90 to 120 days of the manufacturer receiving our purchase order.
Our manufacturer is located in Alberta, Canada. While we have a contract in place with this manufacturer, should we lose its services, we believe we keep enough inventory on hand to meet our customers' needs in the event of short-term supply chain disruptions. We also believe we have adequate alternative manufacturing sources available, and that while such a loss might result in a temporary short-term disruption, we do not anticipate it would result in a materially adverse impact in our ability to meet demand for our products or results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for a significant period of time. We periodically seek alternative manufacturing options to ensure our current fabricator is competitive in price, manufacturing quality and fulfillment speed, and to ensure we have the ability to scale our production levels based on customer demand and market conditions.
Dependence upon Major Customers
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. During the nine-month transition period ended December 31, 2016, the following customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. The loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows:

Customer | Year Ended December 31, 2017 | | Nine-Month Transition Period
Chesapeake Energy | 4 | % | | 11 | %

Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We have filed or acquired several patent applications for various product innovations, both domestically and internationally. Management will continue to assess the strategic and financial value of each potential patent as we develop various intellectual properties. The provisional and/or non-provisional applications we have filed thus far are intended to protect:

• | inline pilot technologies to increase efficiency and reliability of pilot-light performance in a variety of climates;


• | software technology within a modular burner-management system; and


• | certain valve-related technologies.

We have a patent that covers our proprietary coil which expires on December 2, 2035, a patent related to our chemical-management system and its process which expires on March 9, 2036, and a patent over the temperature control valve which expires on November 16, 2036.
Need for Governmental Approval of our Principal Products or Services
We are required to obtain certain safety certifications/ratings for our combustion- and chemical-management systems before they are released to the market. We have received the appropriate certifications including CSA, Intertek and UL certifications for our burner-management and chemical-management systems.
Although sales of our products and services have not been dependent on industry regulations, we believe industry regulations have enhanced our sales environment in certain geographies. We believe that increased regulation of our customers—especially when coupled with consistent enforcement—may influence potential customers to purchase our products or services.
Effects of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulation on our Business
We believe that our products can improve regulatory compliance for our customers. Regulations concerning emissions, safe burner ignition methods, data logging, or other regulatory dimensions that could be related to our products, may impact our customers and markets. Examples of such regulations include:

• | B149.3-10, which has evolved in recent years and is effective for Alberta, governs the safety precautions that must be met concerning the ignition of the pilot and the main burner in Canada. It requires a programmable control to be used, if the controller complies with certain certification requirements promulgated by the CSA.


• | Regulation 7, which was passed during fiscal year 2014 by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, required that combustion devices installed after May 1, 2014, be equipped with an auto-igniter and all existing combustion devices to be equipped with an auto-igniter by May 1, 2016.


• | R307-503-4(1) (b) & (c), which was passed during fiscal year 2014 by the Utah Department of Air Quality, mandated that all new open and enclosed flare have an auto-igniter. The rule required the two largest oil- and gas-producing counties in the state to retrofit all existing enclosed flare with auto-igniters by December 1, 2015, and all other counties to comply by April 1, 2017.


• | Order 25417, which was passed by North Dakota's Industrial Council, is rule that became effective April 1, 2015, requires producers to condition crude oil before transportation and prove oil temperature is above 110 degrees Fahrenheit, to burn off toxic gases from the oil.

Our burner-management system's design enables our products to help companies become compliant with the aforementioned and other regulations. While these industry requirements are relatively new, we intend to continue following their implementation and enforcement. We have assigned sales and service professionals to these specific geographic areas to ensure we have a strong presence in the States and Provinces with specific regulations.
In light of this regulatory environment, we are focused on providing products and services that exceed existing regulatory and industry safety standards; therefore, we believe demand for our products may increase as regulators continue to tighten safety and efficiency standards in the industry. In addition to satisfying regulatory and safety requirements, we believe oil and gas companies continue to recognize the operational efficiencies that can be realized through the use of our burner-management systems and related products. However, significant changes in the regulatory environment could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition. For example, a significant portion of our historical Canadian sales has been aided by such regulation, resulting in a higher estimated penetration rate for our products there, and we anticipate such regulatory pressures to continue. Consequently, if the regulatory environment were to become significantly less stringent, we may experience a decline

in the demand for our products, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any pending or anticipated major regulatory changes.
Research and Development
We place strong emphasis on product-oriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved products and systems. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and the nine-month transition period ended December 31, 2016, we spent $1,221,211 and $757,880, respectively, on research and development programs.
Cost and Effects of Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Laws
Our business is affected by local, provincial, state, federal and foreign laws and other regulations relating to the gas and electric safety standards and codes presently existing in the oil and gas industry, as well as laws and regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and the nine-month transition period ended December 31, 2016, respectively, we did not incur material direct costs to comply with applicable environmental laws. There can be no assurance, however, that this will continue to be the case in the future as environmental laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry are routinely subject to change.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 98 employees, 86 of whom were full-time employees.
