Business
 
Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (together with our subsidiaries, “we,” “our,” “Abeona” or the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation. We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases. Our lead programs include EB-101 (gene-corrected skin grafts) for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH), an adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) and ABO-101 (AAV NAGLU), an AAV based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB). We are also developing ABO-201 (AAV-CLN3) gene therapy for juvenile Batten disease (JNCL), ABO-202 (AAV-CLN1) for treatment of infantile Batten disease (INCL), EB-201 for epidermolysis bullosa (EB), ABO-301 (AAV-FANCC) for Fanconi anemia (FA) disorder and ABO-302 using a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing approach to gene therapy for rare blood diseases. In addition we are developing a proprietary vector platform, AIM™, for next generation product candidates. Our principal executive office is located at 3333 Lee Parkway, Suite 600, Dallas, Texas 75219. Our website address is www.abeonatherapeutics.com.
 
Product Development Strategy
 
Abeona is focused on developing and delivering gene therapy products for severe and life-threatening rare diseases. A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. There are nearly 7,000 rare diseases, which may involve chronic illness, disability, and often, premature death. More than 25 million Americans and 30 million Europeans have a severe, life-threating disease. While rare diseases can affect any age group, about 50% of people affected are children (15 million) and rare diseases account for 35% of deaths in the first year of life. These rare diseases are often poorly diagnosed, very complex, and have no treatment or not very effective treatment. Over 95% of rare diseases do not have a single FDA or EMA approved drug treatment, however most rare diseases are often caused by changes in genes. Approximately 80% of rare diseases are genetic in origin and can present at any stage of life. We believe emerging insights in genetics and advances in biotechnology, as well as new approaches and collaboration between researchers, industry, regulators and patient groups, provide significant opportunities to develop breakthrough treatments for rare diseases.
Developing Next Generation Gene Therapy
 
Gene therapy is the use of DNA as a potential therapy to treat a disease. In many disorders, particularly genetic diseases caused by a single genetic defect, gene therapy aims to treat a disease by delivering the correct copy of DNA into a patient’s cells. The healthy, functional copy of the therapeutic gene then helps the cell function correctly. In gene therapy, DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein is packaged within a ‘‘vector,’’ often a ‘‘naked’’ virus, which is used to transfer the DNA to the inside of cells within the body. Gene therapy can be delivered by a direct injection, either intravenously (IV) or directly into a specific tissue in the body, where it is taken up by individual cells. Once inside cells, the correct DNA is expressed by the cell machinery, resulting in the production of missing or defective protein, which in turn is used to treat the patient’s underlying disease and can provide long-term benefit.
 
Abeona is developing next-generation AAV gene therapies. Viruses such as AAV are utilized because they have evolved a way of encapsulating and delivering one or more genes of the size needed for clinical application, and can be purified in large quantities at high concentration. Unlike AAV vectors found in nature, the AAV vectors used by Abeona have been genetically-modified such that they do not replicate. Although the preclinical studies in animal models of disease demonstrate the promising impact of AAV-mediated gene expression to affected tissues such as the heart, liver and muscle, our programs use a specific virus that is capable of delivering therapeutic DNA across the blood brain barrier and into the central nervous system (CNS) and the somatic system (body), making them attractive for addressing lysosomal storage diseases which have severe CNS manifestations of the disease.
 
Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of rare inborn errors of metabolism resulting from deficiency in normal lysosomal function. These diseases are characterized by progressive accumulation of storage material within the lysosomes of affected cells, ultimately leading to cellular dysfunction. Multiple tissues ranging from musculoskeletal and visceral to tissues of the CNS are typically involved in disease pathology. Since the advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to manage some LSDs, general clinical outcomes have significantly improved; however, treatment with infused protein is lifelong and continued disease progression is still evident in patients. Thus, AAV-based gene therapy may provide a viable alternative or adjunctive therapy to current management strategies for LSDs.

Our initial programs are focused on LSDs such as Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) III A and IIIB. MPSIII, also known as Sanfilippo syndromes type A and type B, is a progressive neuromuscular disease with profound CNS involvement. Our lead product candidates, ABO-101 and ABO-102, have been developed to replace the damaged, malfunctioning enzymes within target cells with the normal, functioning version. ABO-201 is a similar product, using an AAV to deliver the correct lysosomal gene that is defective in juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Delivered via a single injection, these drugs are only given once to a patient.
 
ABO-101 for MPS III B and ABO-102 for MPS III A (Sanfilippo syndrome)
 
MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome) is a group of four inherited genetic diseases, described as type A, B, C or D, which cause enzyme deficiencies that result in the abnormal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (sugars) in body tissues. MPS III is a lysosomal storage disease, a group of rare inborn errors of metabolism resulting from deficiency in normal lysosomal function. The incidence of MPS III (all four types combined) is estimated to be 1 in 70,000 births.
 
Mucopolysaccharides are long chains of sugar molecules used in the building of connective tissues in the body. There is a continuous process in the body of replacing used materials and breaking them down for disposal. Children with MPS III are missing an enzyme which is essential in breaking down used mucopolysaccharides. The partially broken down mucopolysaccharides remain stored in cells in the body causing progressive damage. Babies may show little sign of the disease, but as more and more cells become damaged, symptoms start to appear.
 
In MPS III, the predominant symptoms occur due to accumulation within the CNS, including the brain and spinal cord, resulting in cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and eventual death. To date, there is no cure for MPS III and treatments are largely supportive.
 
Abeona is developing next-generation AAV-based gene therapies for MPS III, which involves a one-time delivery of a normal copy of the defective gene to cells of the CNS with the aim of reversing the effects of the genetic errors that cause the disease.
 
After a single dose in MPS III preclinical models, ABO-101 and ABO-102 induced cells in the CNS and peripheral organs to produce the missing enzymes which helped repair the damage caused to the cells. Preclinical in vivo efficacy studies in MPS III have demonstrated functional benefits that remain for months after treatment. A single dose of ABO-101 or ABO-102 significantly restored normal cell and organ function, corrected cognitive defects that remained months after drug administration, increased neuromuscular control and increased the lifespan of animals with MPS III over 100% one year after treatment compared to untreated control animals. These results are consistent with studies from several laboratories suggesting AAV treatment could potentially benefit patients with MPS III A and B. In addition, safety studies conducted in animal models of MPS III have demonstrated that delivery of AB0-101 or AB0-102 are well tolerated with minimal side effects.
 
EB-101 for the Treatment of Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa and EB-201 for the Correction of Gene Mutations in Skin Cells (Keratinocytes)
 
EB-101 (LZRSE-Col7A1 Engineered Autologous Epidermal Sheets (LEAES)), is an ex vivo gene therapy for the treatment of RDEB. EB-201 (AAVDJ-Col7A1) is a pre-clinical candidate targeting a novel, AAV-mediated gene editing and delivery approach to correct gene mutations in skin cells for patients with RDEB. We entered into an agreement (the ‘‘EB Agreement’’) with EB Research Partnership (‘‘EBRP’’) and Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (‘‘EBMRF’’) to collaborate on gene therapy treatments for EB. The EB Agreement became effective August 3, 2016, on the execution of two licensing agreements with The Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University (‘‘Stanford’’) described below.
 
We entered into a license with Stanford effective August 3, 2016 for the EB-101 (LZRSE-Col7A1 Engineered Autologous Epidermal Sheets (LEAES)) technology, and we have performed certain preclinical development work and are performing clinical trials of a gene therapy treatment for EB based upon such in-licensed technology.
 
We also entered into a license with Stanford effective August 3, 2016 for the EB-201 (AAV DJ COL7A1) technology, and we plan to perform preclinical development and clinical trials of a gene therapy treatment for EB based upon such in-licensed technology.

ABO-201 for juvenile Batten disease (or Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses) (JNCL) and ABO-202 (AAV-CLN1) gene therapy for treatment of infantile Batten disease (or Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses) (INCL)
 
ABO-201 (AAV CLN3) is an AAV-based gene therapy which has shown promising preclinical efficacy in delivery of a normal copy of the defective CLN3 gene to cells of the CNS with the aim of reversing the effects of the genetic errors that cause JNCL. JNCL is a rare, fatal, autosomal recessive (inherited) disorder of the nervous system that typically begins in children between 4 and 8 years of age. Often the first noticeable sign of JNCL is vision impairment, which tends to progress rapidly and eventually result in blindness. As the disease progresses, children experience loss of previously acquired skills (developmental regression). This regression usually begins with the loss of the ability to speak in complete sentences. Children then lose motor skills, such as the ability to walk or sit. They also develop movement abnormalities that include rigidity or stiffness, slow or diminished movements (hypokinesia), and stooped posture. Beginning in mid- to late childhood, affected children may have recurrent seizures (epilepsy), heart problems, behavioral problems, and difficulty sleeping. Life expectancy is greatly reduced. Most people with juvenile Batten disease live into their twenties or thirties. As yet, no specific treatment is known that can halt or reverse the symptoms of JNCL.
 
JNCL is the most common form of a group of disorders known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). Collectively, all forms of NCL affect an estimated 2 to 4 in 100,000 live births in the United States. NCLs are more common in Finland, where approximately 1 in 12,500 individuals are affected, as well as Sweden, other parts of northern Europe, and Newfoundland, Canada.
 
Most cases of JNCL are caused by mutations in the CLN3 gene, which is the focus of our AAV-based gene therapy approach. These mutations disrupt the function of cellular structures called lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments in the cell that normally digest and recycle different types of molecules. Lysosome malfunction leads to a buildup of fatty substances called lipopigments and proteins within these cell structures. These accumulations occur in cells throughout the body, but neurons in the brain seem to be particularly vulnerable to damage. The progressive death of cells, especially in the brain, leads to vision loss, seizures, and intellectual decline in children with JNCL.
 
ABO-202 (AAV9 CLN1) is an AAV-based gene therapy which has shown promising preclinical efficacy in delivery of a normal copy of the defective CLN1 gene to cells of the central nervous system with the aim of reversing the effects of the genetic errors that cause an infantile form of Batten disease (also known as infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis).
 
ABO-301 for Fanconi Anemia (FA) and ABO-302 for rare blood diseases using a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing approach to gene therapy for rare blood diseases
 
ABO-301 (AAV-FANCC) is an AAV-based gene therapy which has shown promising preclinical efficacy in delivery of a normal copy of the defective gene to cells of the hematopoietic or blood system with the aim of reversing the effects of the genetic errors that cause FA. FA is a rare (1 in 160,000) pediatric, autosomal recessive (inherited) disease characterized by multiple physical abnormalities, organ defects, bone marrow failure, and a higher than normal risk of cancer. The average lifespan for people with FA is 20 to 30 years.
 
The major function of bone marrow is to produce new blood cells. In FA, a DNA mutation renders the FANCC gene nonfunctional. Loss of FANCC causes skeletal abnormalities and leads to bone marrow failure. FA patients also have much higher rates of hematological diseases, such as acute myeloid leukemia or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in people with FA is between 10 and 30 percent. Aside from bone marrow transplantation, there are no specific treatments known that can halt or reverse the symptoms of FA. Repairing fibroblast cells in FA patients with a functional FANCC gene is the focus of our AAV-based gene therapy approach.
 
Using a novel CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 (CRISPR associated protein 9) system, researchers used a protein-RNA complex composed of an enzyme known as Cas9 bound to a guide RNA molecule that has been designed to recognize a particular DNA sequence. The RNA molecules guide the Cas9 complex to the location in the genome that requires repair. CRISPR-Cas9 uniquely enables surgically efficient knock-out, knock-down or selective editing of defective genes in the context of their natural promoters, unlocking the potential to treat both recessive and dominant forms of genetic diseases. Most importantly, this approach has the potential to allow for more precise gene modification.

Polymer Hydrogel Technology (PHT™)
 
MuGard® (mucoadhesive oral wound rinse) approved for mucositis, stomatitis, aphthous ulcers, and traumatic ulcers
 
MuGard is our marketed product for the management of oral mucositis, a frequent side-effect of cancer therapy for which there is no other established treatment. MuGard, a proprietary nanopolymer formulation, received marketing clearance from the FDA in the U.S. as well as Europe, China, Australia, New Zealand and Korea. We launched MuGard in the U.S. in 2010 and licensed MuGard for commercialization in the U.S. to AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AMAG) in 2013. We licensed MuGard to RHEI Pharmaceuticals, N.V. for China and other Southeast Asian countries in 2010; Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. for South Korea in 2014; and Norgine B.V. for the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Australia and New Zealand in 2014.
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that the value of technology both to us and to our potential corporate partners is established and enhanced by our broad intellectual property positions. Consequently, we have already been issued and seek to obtain additional U.S. and foreign patent protection for our products, including those under development and for new discoveries.
 
Patent applications are filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and, when appropriate, with the Paris Convention’s Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) Countries (most major countries in Western Europe and the Far East) for our inventions and prospective products.
 
We have a strategy of maintaining an ongoing line of patent continuation applications for each major category of patentable carrier and delivery technology. By this approach, we are extending the intellectual property protection of our basic targeting technology and initial agents to cover additional specific carriers and agents, some of which are anticipated to carry the priority dates of the original applications.

We are aware of an issued U.S. patent owned by a third party directed to the AAV9 viral vector and methods for its use. This patent was issued in 2002. We understand that the owner of this patent grants licenses under the patent from time to time, and we expect that, prior to commercializing our ABO-101, ABO-102, ABO-201 or ABO-202 product candidates (which utilize the AAV9 vector), we would seek to license this patent. Other licensed technologies may also require the licensing of additional patents for commercialization.
 
MuGard patents
 
For our mucoadhesive liquid technology, used in MuGard, two U.S. patents have been issued and two European patents have been granted. Two European patents have been granted and validated in numerous European countries. Patents have also been granted in several other major territories worldwide. Our mucoadhesive liquid technology patents and applications cover a range of products for a variety of diseases and conditions affecting the oral cavity, including the management of the various phases of mucositis. MuGard mucoadhesive technology patents expire in 2022.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government, principally by the FDA, and, to a lesser extent, by other federal and state agencies as well as comparable agencies in foreign countries where registration of products will be pursued. Although a number of our formulations incorporate extensively tested drug substances, because the resulting formulations make claims of enhanced efficacy and/or improved side effect profiles, they are expected to be classified as new drugs by the FDA.
 
The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal, state and foreign statutes and regulations govern the testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, shipping and record keeping of our products. The FDA has the authority to approve or not approve new drug applications and inspect research, clinical and manufacturing records and facilities.
 
Among the requirements for drug approval and testing is that the prospective manufacturer’s facilities and methods conform to the FDA’s Code of Good Manufacturing Practices regulations, which establishes the minimum requirements for methods to be used in, and the facilities or controls to be used during, the production process. Such facilities are subject to ongoing FDA inspection to insure compliance.
 
The steps required before a pharmaceutical product may be produced and marketed in the U.S. include preclinical tests, the filing of an Investigational New Drug (‘‘IND’’) application with the FDA, which must become effective pursuant to FDA regulations before human clinical trials may commence, numerous phases of clinical testing and the FDA approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) prior to commercial sale.

Preclinical tests are conducted in the laboratory, usually involving animals, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the potential product. The results of preclinical tests are submitted as part of the IND application and are fully reviewed by the FDA prior to granting the sponsor permission to commence clinical trials in humans. All trials are conducted under International Conference on Harmonization, good clinical practice guidelines. All investigator sites and sponsor facilities are subject to FDA inspection to insure compliance. Clinical trials typically involve a three-phase process. Phase 1 the initial clinical evaluations, consists of administering the drug and testing for safety and tolerated dosages and in some indications such as cancer and HIV, as preliminary evidence of efficacy in humans. Phase 2 involves a study to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication and to determine optimal dosage and dose interval and to identify possible adverse side effects and risks in a larger patient group. When a product is found safe, and initial efficacy is established in Phase 2, it is then evaluated in Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 3 trials consist of expanded multi-location testing for efficacy and safety to evaluate the overall benefit-to-risk index of the investigational drug in relationship to the disease treated. The results of preclinical and human clinical testing are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA for approval to commence commercial sales.
 
The process of forming the requisite testing, data collection, analysis and compilation of an IND and an NDA is labor intensive and costly and may take a protracted time period. In some cases, tests may have to be redone or new tests instituted to comply with FDA requests. Review by the FDA may also take considerable time and there is no guarantee that an NDA will be approved. Therefore, we cannot estimate with any certainty the length of the approval cycle.
 
We are also governed by other federal, state and local laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, employment practices, as well as environmental protection.

Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by intense competition, rapid product development and technological change. Competition is intense among manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals and other product areas where we may develop and market products in the future. Most of our potential competitors are large, well established pharmaceutical, chemical or healthcare companies with considerably greater financial, marketing, sales and technical resources than are available to us. Additionally, many of our potential competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow such competitors to develop new or improved products that may compete with our product lines. Our potential products could be rendered obsolete or made uneconomical by the development of new products to treat the conditions to be addressed by our developments, technological advances affecting the cost of production, or marketing or pricing actions by one or more of our potential competitors. Our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of such developments. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or with the assistance of major health care companies in areas where we are developing product candidates. We are aware of certain development projects for products to treat or prevent certain diseases targeted by us, and the existence of these potential products or other products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of products developed by us.
 
Gene therapy competition
 The gene therapy industry is highly competitive and driven by several large competitors including Bluebird, Voyager, RegenXbio, Spark, Dimension, Avalanche, uniQure, and Lysogene.
 
MuGard competition
 ActoGeniX N.V., Alder Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Applied Protein Sciences, LLC, Avaxia Biologics, Inc., BioAlliance Pharma S.A., BMG Pharma s.r.l., Camurus AB, DARA BioSciences, Inc., Galera Therapeutics, Inc. Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Maya Biotech Ltd., NephRx, Piramal Healthcare Ltd., Soligenix, Inc. and Synedgen are developing products to treat mucositis that may compete with our mucoadhesive liquid technology. Products that are marketed to treat mucositis include Caphosol by Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Gelclair by DARA BioSciences, Inc., Episil by Camurus AB, and Kepivance by Biovitrum.
 
Many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources, including larger research and development, marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, our competitors may successfully develop technologies and drugs that are more effective or less costly than any that we are developing or which would render our technology and future products obsolete and noncompetitive.
 
In addition, some of our competitors have greater experience than we do in conducting preclinical and clinical trials and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA or other regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly than we do. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage. Drugs resulting from our research and development efforts or from our joint efforts with collaborative partners therefore may not be commercially competitive with our competitors’ existing products or products under development.

In the area of advanced drug delivery, which is the focus of our early stage research and development activities, a number of companies are developing or evaluating enhanced drug delivery systems. We expect that technological developments will occur at a rapid rate and that competition is likely to intensify as various alternative delivery system technologies achieve similar if not identical advantages.
 
Even if our products are fully developed and receive required regulatory approval, of which there can be no assurance, we believe that our products can only compete successfully if marketed by a company having expertise and a strong presence in the therapeutic area. Consequently, we do not currently plan to establish an internal marketing organization. By forming strategic alliances with major and regional pharmaceutical companies, management believes that our development risks should be minimized and that the technology potentially could be more rapidly developed and successfully introduced into the marketplace.
 
Other Key Developments
 
On February 12, 2018, we announced that the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) to our ABO-202 program (AAV-CLN1), an AAV-based gene therapy for the treatment of infantile Batten disease.
 
ABO-202, developed with Steven Gray, Ph.D. and the support of The Saoirse Foundation, Taylor's Tale, Garrett the Grand Batten Fighter, Hayden's Batten Disease Foundation, and the Batten Disease Support and Research Association, is anticipated to enter clinical trials in 2018.
 
The preclinical data for ABO-202 were presented at the WORLDSymposium for Lysosomal Diseases held in San Diego, California from February 5-9, 2018. Key findings included:
 

· | CLN1 mice recapitulate the major features of the human disease manifestations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The data demonstrate that a single intrathecal (IT) injection of self-complementary adeno-associated virus 9 (scAAV9) encoding the human CLN1 gene to CLN1 mice at 1 week and 1 month (pre-symptomatic) significantly increased their survival, improved behavior and reduced motor deficits;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Higher IT doses further improved these observations, suggesting that methods increasing CNS exposure may be beneficial and provided some survival and behavioral benefit to symptomatic INCL mice; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A combination approach delivering ABO-202 by both intravenous and intrathecal routes of administration further increased survival efficacy 50% and improved potential treatment options for older animals with advanced disease manifestations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
On February 8, 2018 we announced updated clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial for ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH), the Company’s investigational gene therapy for the treatment of Sanfilippo syndrome Type A (MPS IIIA), a rare autosomal-recessive lysosomal storage disease. The results demonstrate robust and durable clinical effects achieved throughout various time points post-administration. To date, 10 patients have been dosed with a single intravenous injection of ABO-102. Results were reported during the WORLDSymposium.
 
In the trial, subjects received a single intravenous injection of ABO-102 to facilitate systemic delivery of a corrective copy of the gene associated with onset and progression of MPS IIIA. Subjects were evaluated at multiple time points post-injection for safety assessments and signals of biopotency and clinical activity.
 
On February 7, 2018 we reported preliminary 30-Day safety and biopotency signals from the first patient dosed in the Company’s ongoing Phase 1/2 trial for ABO-101, a gene therapy treatment for patients with MPS IIIB (Sanfilippo syndrome Type B), enrolling at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. The ABO-101 therapy involves a single intravenous injection of AAV gene therapy for subjects with MPS IIIB, a rare autosomal recessive disease causing neurocognitive decline, speech and mobility loss, and premature death. Abeona plans to enroll a total of three patients in Cohort 1 (2E13 vg/kg) before dose-escalating to the Cohort 2 dose (5E13 vg/kg).
 
The Phase 1/2 study is designed to evaluate safety and preliminary indications of efficacy of ABO-101 in subjects suffering from MPS IIIB. In the first patient treated in Cohort 1:

· | ABO-101, at a systemic dose of 2E13 vg/kg, is well-tolerated, with no treatment related adverse events or serious adverse events (SAEs) through 30 days of follow up.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Early biopotency signals include significant heparan sulfate (HS) reductions observed in cerebral spinal fluid (50%), urine (69%), plasma (60%) and urinary total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) (67%);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 50% decline in CSF heparan sulfate from baseline supports previous AAV9 clinical observations that ABO-101 crossed the blood brain barrier after intravenous administration;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Normalized NAGLU enzyme activity observed represented by a greater than 300-fold increase over baseline at 30 days post administration.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Subjects in the Phase 1/2 trial receive a single, intravenous injection of ABO-101, which uses an AAV vector to introduce a corrective copy of the NAGLU gene associated with MPS IIIB disease. Subjects will be evaluated at multiple time points over the initial 30 days post-injection for safety assessments and initial signals of biopotency. Results in the first patient dosed with ABO-101 suggest strong CNS and broader systemic distribution, with the potential to reduce levels of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that represent the lysosomal storage pathology central to MPS IIIB disease progression.
 
On January 29, 2018 we announced that the FDA has granted the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to EB-101, the Company’s gene-corrected autologous cell therapy product for patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB).
 
On December 20, 2017 we announced that the first patient in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for ABO-101 (AAV-NAGLU), a single treatment gene therapy for patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB), has been dosed at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Columbus, Ohio.
 
On November 9, 2017, we announced that the first patient was enrolled in our ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH) Phase 1/2 clinical trial for MPS-IIIA at the Hospital Clinico Universitario of Santiago de Compostela, Spain. In conjunction with the initiation of the Spain clinical site, we have established a local subsidiary to manage clinical trial and regulatory developments in Europe.
 
On October 19, 2017, we closed an underwritten public offering of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, at a public offering price of $16.00 per share. The gross proceeds to the Company were $92,000,000, before deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.
 
On October 16, 2017, we announced a collaborative agreement between nine Sanfilippo foundations to provide up to approximately $13.85 million of grants to Abeona in installments for the advancement of the Company’s clinical stage gene therapies for Sanfilippo Syndrome Type A (MPS IIIA) and Sanfilippo Syndrome Type B (MPS IIIB), subject to achievement of certain milestones.
 
On October 11, 2017, we announced enrollment of our first two patients in an expansion of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial in ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH) for MPS IIIA. While we believe that the data from this expansion cohort, together with the data generated in this program to date, will allow us to submit a BLA, we have no assurance to this effect from the FDA.
 
On October 6, 2017, we announced top-line one year data from our ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH) MPS IIIA Trial at the Cell & Gene Meeting on the Mesa. Observations demonstrated:
 

· | At one year post-injection, two patients in Cohort 1 demonstrated reduction of 69.3% +/- 5.7% (P<0.001) in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) heparan sulfate (HS). One patient in the Cohort was unable to be accessed due to an adverse event unrelated to the therapy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Hepatomegaly — Cohort 1 subjects demonstrated normalization of liver volumes of 80% (+/- 16.2%) points at one year (P<0.005) post-injection. The natural history study in 25 subjects with MPS III demonstrated that subjects had increased liver volumes averaging 220% at baseline that was maintained over a year of follow-up.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Initial analysis of Cohort 1 patient MRI data showed evidence of stabilization of the area of deep brain architecture in the thalamus and putamen (P<0.05) at one year post-administration.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cognitive assessments at the 12-month time point for Cohort 1 showed evidence of stabilization in the Leiter-R non-verbal IQ (n=2) and Vineland (adaptive behavior) (n=3, P=0.05) scales.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No serious adverse events related to the drug were reported in subjects in the cohort receiving ABO-102 (Cohort 1: 5E12 vg/kg) through over 2,000 cumulative follow-up days.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
On October 4, 2017, we announced the dedication of a commercial gene therapy manufacturing facility in Cleveland, Ohio to support development of advanced gene and cell therapies for treatment of life-threatening rare diseases.
 
On September 28, 2017, we announced a collaboration with Brammer Bio for the commercial translation of ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH).
