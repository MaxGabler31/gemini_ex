Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We are Inter Parfums, Inc. We operate in the fragrance business, and manufacture, market and distribute a wide array of fragrance and fragrance related products. Organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in May 1985 as Jean Philippe Fragrances, Inc., we changed our name to Inter Parfums, Inc. in July 1999. We have also retained our brand name, Jean Philippe Fragrances, for some of our mass market products.
 
Our worldwide headquarters and the office of our three (3) wholly-owned United States subsidiaries, Jean Philippe Fragrances, LLC and Inter Parfums USA, LLC, both New York limited liability companies, and IP Beauty, Inc. (formerly Nickel USA, Inc.), a Delaware corporation, are located at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10176, and our telephone number is 212.983.2640. We also own 100% of Inter Parfums USA Hong Kong Limited indirectly through our 100% owned subsidiary, Inter Parfums USA, LLC.
 
Our consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary, Inter Parfums Holdings, S.A., and its majority-owned subsidiary, Interparfums SA, maintain executive offices at 4 Rond Point des Champs Elysees, 75008 Paris, France. Our telephone number in Paris is 331.5377.0000. Interparfums SA is the sole owner of three (3) distribution subsidiaries: Inter Parfums srl for Italy, Inter España Parfums et Cosmetiques, SL, for Spain and Interparfums Luxury Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation for distribution of prestige brands in the United States. Interparfums SA is also the majority owner of Parfums Rochas Spain, SL, a Spanish limited liability company, which specializes in the distribution of Rochas fragrances, as well as the majority owner of Inter Parfums Gmbh, a distribution subsidiary for Germany. As of December 31, 2017, our German distribution subsidiary has been replaced by the former minority-owner in such subsidiary, which is now acting as the distributor of our products in Germany.

Company Overview
 
The following information is qualified in its entirety by and should be read together with the more detailed information and audited financial statements, including the related notes, contained or incorporated by reference in this report.
General
 
We operate in the fragrance business and manufacture, market and distribute a wide array of fragrance and fragrance related products. We manage our business in two segments, European based operations and United States based operations. Certain prestige fragrance products are produced and marketed by our European operations through our 73% owned subsidiary in Paris, Interparfums SA, which is also a publicly traded company as 27% of Interparfums SA shares trade on the NYSE Euronext.
 
Our business is not capital intensive, and it is important to note that we do not own manufacturing facilities. We act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers. These components are received at one of our distribution centers and then, based upon production needs, the components are sent to one of several third party fillers which manufacture the finished product for us and deliver them to one of our distribution centers.
 
Our prestige products focus on niche brands, each with a devoted following. By concentrating in markets where the brands are best known, we have had many successful launches. We typically launch new fragrance families for our brands every year or two, and more frequently seasonal and limited edition fragrances are introduced as well.
 
The creation and marketing of each product family is intimately linked with the brand’s name, its past and present positioning, customer base and, more generally, the prevailing market atmosphere. Accordingly, we generally study the market for each proposed family of fragrance products for almost a full year before we introduce any new product into the market. This study is intended to define the general position of the fragrance family and more particularly its scent, bottle, packaging and appeal to the buyer. In our opinion, the unity of these four elements of the marketing mix makes for a successful product.
 
As with any business, many aspects of our operations are subject to influences outside our control. We believe we have a strong brand portfolio with global reach and potential. As part of our strategy, we plan to continue to make investments behind fast-growing markets and channels to grow market share. We discuss in greater detail risk factors relating to our business in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, and the reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

European Operations
 
We produce and distribute our fragrance products primarily under license agreements with brand owners, and fragrance product sales through our European operations represented approximately 81% of net sales for 2017. We have built a portfolio of prestige brands, which include Boucheron, Coach, Jimmy Choo, Karl Lagerfeld, Lanvin, Montblanc, Paul Smith, Repetto, Rochas, S.T. Dupont and Van Cleef & Arpels, whose products are distributed in over 100 countries around the world.
 
With respect to the Company’s largest brands, we own the Lanvin brand name for its class of trade, and license the Montblanc and Jimmy Choo brand names. As a percentage of net sales, product sales for the Company’s largest brands were as follows:
 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
-----------+-------------------------+---
 | 2017 | | | 2016 | | 2015
Montblanc | | 21 | % | | 23 | % | 21 | %
Jimmy Choo | | 18 | % | | 17 | % | 20 | %
Lanvin | | 11 | % | | 12 | % | 15 | %

United States Operations
 
Prestige brand fragrance products are also marketed through our United States operations, and represented 19% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. These fragrance products are sold under trademarks owned by us or pursuant to license or other agreements with the owners of brands, which include Abercrombie & Fitch, Agent Provocateur, Anna Sui, bebe, Dunhill, Hollister, French Connection and Oscar de la Renta  brands. 
Recent Developments
 
GUESS License
 
In February 2018, the Company entered into an exclusive, 15-year worldwide license agreement with GUESS?, Inc. for the creation, development and distribution of fragrances under the GUESS brand. This license will take effect on April 1, 2018, and our rights under such license are subject to certain minimum advertising expenditures and royalty payments as are customary in our industry.
Jimmy Choo License Renewal
 
In December 2017, the Company and J Choo Ltd amended their license agreement and extended their partnership through December 31, 2031. Our initial Jimmy Choo license was signed in 2009.
Income Tax Recovery
 
The French government had introduced a 3% tax on dividends or deemed dividends for entities subject to French corporate income tax in 2012. In 2017, the French Constitutional Court released a decision declaring that the 3% tax on dividends or deemed dividends is unconstitutional. As a result of that decision, the Company has filed a claim for refund of approximately $3.6 million (€3.2 million) for these taxes paid since 2015 including accrued interest of approximately $0.4 million. The Company recorded the refund claim in the accompanying financial statements as of December 31, 2017.
 
 3



Impairment Loss
 
The Company reviews intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Product sales of some of our legacy mass market product lines have been declining for many years and now represent a very small portion of our net sales. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company set in motion a plan to discontinue several of these product lines over the next few years. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $2.1 million as of December 31, 2017, which represented approximately 50% of total intangible assets relating to our mass market product lines. The Company also increased its inventory obsolescence reserves by $0.5 million as of December 31, 2017, to adjust to net realizable value the inventory of the product lines expected to be discontinued.
Paul Smith License Renewal
 
In May 2017, the Company renewed its license agreement for an additional four years with Paul Smith for the creation, development, and distribution of fragrance products through December 2021, without any material changes in terms and conditions. Our initial 12-year license agreement with Paul Smith was signed in 1998, and had previously been extended through December 31, 2017.
Settlement with French Tax Authorities
 
As previously reported, the French Tax Authorities examined the 2012 tax return of Interparfums SA. The main issues challenged by the French Tax Authorities related to the commission rate and royalty rate paid to Interparfums Singapore Pte. and Interparfums (Suisse) SARL, respectively. Due to the subjective nature of the issues involved, in April 2016, Interparfums SA reached an agreement in principle to settle the entire matter with the French Tax Authorities. The settlement required Interparfums SA to pay a tax assessment of $1.9 million covering the issues for not only the 2012 tax year, but also covering the issues for the tax years ended 2013 through 2015. The settlement, which was finalized by the French Tax Authorities in the first quarter of 2017, was accrued in March 2016.
Fragrance Products
 
General
 
We are the owner of the Rochas brand, and Lanvin brand name and trademark for our class of trade. In addition, we have built a portfolio of licensed prestige brands whereby we produce and distribute our prestige fragrance products under license agreements with brand owners. Under license agreements, we obtain the right to use the brand name, create new fragrances and packaging, determine positioning and distribution, and market and sell the licensed products, in exchange for the payment of royalties. Our rights under license agreements are also generally subject to certain minimum sales requirements and advertising expenditures as are customary in our industry.

Fragrance Portfolio

Abercrombie & Fitch— In December 2014, we entered into a 7-year worldwide license to create, produce and distribute new fragrances and fragrance related products under the Abercrombie & Fitch brand name. The Company distributes these fragrances internationally in specialty stores, high-end department stores and duty free shops, and in the U.S., in duty free shops and in select Abercrombie & Fitch retail stores.

Agent Provocateur— In July 2013, we entered into a 10.5-year exclusive worldwide license to create, produce and distribute fragrances and fragrance related products under London-based luxury lingerie brand, Agent Provocateur. In 2013, we commenced distribution of selected fragrances within the brand’s legacy fragrance portfolio, and in 2014, we launched our first new Agent Provocateur scents, Fatale and Fatale Pink. In 2016, we introduced Agent Provocateur Aphrodisiaque, our second fragrance family for the brand. An addition to the brand’s signature fragrance collection took place in 2017 with another planned in 2018.

Anna Sui—In June 2011, we entered into a 10-year exclusive worldwide fragrance license agreement to produce and distribute fragrances and fragrance related products under the Anna Sui brand.

We are working in partnership with American designer, Anna Sui, and her creative team to build upon the brand’s growing customer appeal, and develop new fragrances that capture the brand’s very sweet feminine girly aspect, combined with touch of nostalgia, hipness and rock-and-roll. Anna Sui’s devoted customer base, which spans the world, is concentrated in Asia.
 
During 2017 Anna Sui brand sales experienced an upturn in sales as economic conditions in China, a strong market for the brand, had been improving. During the economic downturn in China, we maintained our strong advertising and marketing commitment to Anna Sui, which was rewarded as the Chinese economy improved. In addition, the brand’s growing popularity in other Asian countries contributed to the upturn in Anna Sui fragrance sales, which we exploited with a major new product launch Fantasia by Anna Sui, with distribution concentrated across Asia. In the second half of 2018, we will introduce Fantasia Mermaid for Anna Sui. We are currently distributing several lines of product, including top sellers, La Vie de Bohème, Romantica and Secret Wish.
 
bebe Stores— In July 2008, we entered into an exclusive 6-year worldwide agreement with bebe Stores, Inc., that has been renewed through June 30, 2020, under which we design, manufacture and supply fragrances for company-owned bebe stores in the United States and Canada, as well as select specialty and department stores worldwide. We have incorporated bebe’s signature look into fragrances for the brand’s strong, hip, sexy, and sophisticated clientele.

In 2016, we launched our first Coach fragrance, a women’s scent, which has quickly become a top selling prestige fragrance.

For 2018, we will start the year with a companion fragrance for the Coach signature scent for women followed in the second quarter with a new version of the Coach men’s signature scent.
 
Dunhill—In December 2012, we entered into an exclusive 10-year worldwide fragrance license to create, produce and distribute fragrances and fragrance related products under the Dunhill brand.

We took over production and distribution of Dunhill legacy fragrances beginning in 2013, and we introduced a legacy scent flanker, Desire Black, in 2014. In 2015, we rolled out our new Dunhill scent, Icon, the success of which has made the Dunhill brand our largest and fastest growing brand within our United States based operations. For 2016, we launched several product extensions including Icon Luxury Spray Set and Icon Elite.

Women’s shoes remain the core of the product offer, alongside handbags, small leather goods, scarves, sunglasses, eyewear, belts, fragrance and men’s shoes. Chief Executive Officer Pierre Denis and Creative Director Sandra Choi together share a vision to create one of the world’s most treasured luxury brands. Jimmy Choo has a global store network encompassing more than 150 stores and is present in the most prestigious department and specialty stores worldwide. Jimmy Choo is part of the Michael Kors Holdings Limited luxury fashion group.
 
        Our first fragrance under the Jimmy Choo brand, a women’s signature scent, rolled out globally in 2011. In 2013, we launched our second Jimmy Choo line, Flash, and in 2014, we debuted Jimmy Choo Man our first men’s scent which ranked in 2015 as the 9th best-selling men’s fragrance in the United States. In 2015, the launch of Jimmy Choo Illicit, our third women’s fragrance under that label hit the market. For 2016, we debuted a new women’s flanker, Jimmy Choo Illicit Flower. In 2017, building on the very strong fragrance family trees of the Jimmy Choo signature scent for women (2011) and Jimmy Choo Man (2014), we successfully launched Jimmy Choo L’Eau for women and Jimmy Choo Man Ice. The brand’s women’s signature scent will add still another member to the family with Jimmy Choo Fever debuting during the summer of 2018. 
 
Karl Lagerfeld— In October 2012, we entered into a 20-year worldwide license agreement with Karl Lagerfeld B.V., the internationally renowned haute couture fashion house, to create, produce and distribute fragrances under the Karl Lagerfeld brand.
 
Under the creative direction of Karl Lagerfeld, one of the world’s most influential and iconic designers, the Lagerfeld Portfolio represents a modern approach to distribution, an innovative digital strategy and a global 360 degree vision that reflects the designer’s own style and soul. Our first line, a premium namesake duo scent for both men and women, was launched in 2014. However, in 2015, with sales concentrated in Russia and northern Europe, re-orders were disappointing and sales of this brand declined despite the launch of Private Klub, a line extension.
 
We are seeking to reinvigorate this brand by changing its strategic positioning and instituting new pricing with the launch of a new duo called Les Parfums Matières, which debuted in the second half of 2017. Initial sales of this line have been promising.
 
Lanvin— In July 2007, we acquired the worldwide rights to the Lanvin brand names and international trademarks listed in Class 3, our class of trade. A synonym of luxury and elegance, the Lanvin fashion house, founded in 1889 by Jeanne Lanvin, expanded into fragrances in the 1920s.
 
Lanvin is currently our third largest brand by sales volume. Lanvin fragrances occupy an important position in the selective distribution market in France, Eastern Europe and Asia, and we have several lines currently in distribution, including: Arpège, Lanvin L’Homme, Éclat d’Arpège, Rumeur 2 Rose, Jeanne Lanvin and Modern Princess. Our Éclat d’Arpège line accounts for approximately 50% of this brand’s sales. To capitalize on the success of our Éclat d’Arpège line, in 2015 we launched Éclat d’Arpège Homme as well as Éclat de Fleurs. In late 2016, we released a new women’s line, Lanvin Modern Princess in limited distribution to counteract depressed sales in 2016, primarily owing to market weakness in Russia and China. In 2017, we successfully rolled out broader international distribution of Lanvin Modern Princess and premiered another interpretation of Éclat d’Arpège. In the pipeline for 2018 are new interpretations of Éclat d’Arpège and Modern Princess.

Montblanc—In October 2015, we extended our license agreement with Montblanc by five years. The original agreement, signed in 2010, provided us with the exclusive worldwide license rights to create, produce and distribute fragrances and fragrance related products under the Montblanc brand through December 31, 2020. The new agreement, which went into effect on January 1, 2016, extends the partnership through December 31, 2025 without any material changes in operating conditions from the prior license. 
 
Montblanc has achieved a world-renowned position in the luxury segment and has become a purveyor of exclusive products, which reflect today’s exacting demands for timeless design, tradition and master craftsmanship. Through its leadership positions in writing instruments, watches and leather goods, promising growth outlook in women’s jewelry, active presence in more than 70 countries, network of more than 350 boutiques worldwide and high standards of product design and quality, Montblanc has grown to be our largest fragrance brand.
 
In 2011, we launched our first new Montblanc fragrance, Legend, which quickly became our best-selling men’s line. In 2012, we launched our first women’s fragrance under the Montblanc brand, and our second men’s line, Emblem, was launched in 2014. The Emblem line was expanded in 2015 to include Montblanc Emblem Intense and a new women’s scent, Lady Emblem. In 2016, we further extended our successful Montblanc Legend line with a new men’s scent, Montblanc Legend Spirit. For 2017, we continued the rollout of the highly successful launch of Montblanc Legend Spirit and launched Montblanc Legend Night during the 2017 holiday season. For 2018 we will continue the global rollout of Legend Night.
 
Oscar de la Renta— In October 2013, we entered into a 12-year exclusive worldwide license to create, produce and distribute fragrances and fragrance related products under the Oscar de la Renta brand. In 2014, we took over distribution of fragrances within the brand’s legacy fragrance portfolio, and our first new women’s fragrance under the Oscar de la Renta brand, Extraordinary, was launched in 2015. For 2016, in addition to several flankers that we launched throughout the year in select markets, we debuted a new men’s fragrance family, Oscar de la Renta Gentlemen. Bella Blanca, a new Oscar de la Renta scent, debuted in early 2018.
 
Oscar de la Renta is one of the world’s leading luxury goods firms. The New York-based company was established in 1965, and encompasses a full line of women’s accessories, bridal, childrenswear, fragrance, beauty and home goods, in addition to its internationally renowned signature women’s ready to wear collection. Oscar de la Renta products are sold globally in fine department and specialty stores, www.oscardelarenta.com and through wholesale channels. The Oscar de la Renta brand has a loyal following in the United States, Canada and Latin America.
 
Paul Smith— In May 2017, the Company renewed its license agreement for an additional four years with Paul Smith for the creation, development, and distribution of fragrance products through December 2021, without any material changes in terms and conditions. Our initial 12-year license agreement with Paul Smith was signed in 1998, and had previously been extended through December 31, 2017.

Paul Smith is an internationally renowned British designer who creates fashion with a clear identity. Paul Smith has a modern style which combines elegance, inventiveness and a sense of humor and enjoys a loyal following, especially in the UK and Japan. Fragrances include: Paul Smith, Paul Smith Extrême, Paul Smith Rose and Paul Smith Essential.
 
Repetto— In December 2011, we entered into a 13-year exclusive worldwide license agreement to create, produce and distribute fragrances under the Repetto brand.
 
Created in 1947 by Rose Repetto at the request of her son, dancer and choreographer Roland Petit, Repetto is today a legendary name in the world of dance. For a number of years, it has developed timeless and must-have collections with a fully modernized signature style ranging from dance shoes, ballet slippers, flat shoes, and sandals to more recently handbags and high-end accessories.
 
With Repetto boutiques in several countries throughout the world, the brand has branched out into Asia, notably China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea and Japan with a mix of cross-generational appeal and French chic. Our first Repetto fragrance line was launched in 2013 and a floral scent was added in 2015. Despite this brand’s success with footwear, handbags and high-end accessories, fragrance sales have been disappointing due to the lack of brand recognition. Dance with Repetto debuted in the first quarter of 2018.
 
Rochas— In May 2015, we acquired the Rochas brand from The Procter & Gamble Company. Founded by Marcel Rochas in 1925, the brand began as a fashion house and expanded into perfumery in the 1950s under Hélène Rochas’ direction. This transaction included all brand names and registered trademarks for Rochas (Femme, Madame, Eau de Rochas, etc.), mainly for class 3 (cosmetics) and class 25 (fashion). Substantially the entire €106 million purchase price for the assets acquired (approximately $118 million) was allocated to trademarks with indefinite lives, including approximately $5.4 million in acquisition related expenses.
 
This acquisition opened a new page in the Company’s history by integrating for the first time both fragrances and fashion. This is allowing us to apply a global approach to managing a fragrance brand with complete freedom in terms of creativity and aesthetic choices, as well as a very high degree of visibility to establish a position of even greater preeminence for Rochas in the luxury goods universe. Rochas brand sales currently include approximately $2.5 million of royalties generated by the fashion and accessory business via its portfolio of license agreements. We have been reviving the nearly century old brand’s luster, and our first new fragrance for Rochas, Mademoiselle Rochas, had a successful launch that began in the first quarter of 2017. This success was primarily attributable to the strength of the Eau de Rochas line and the successful rollout of Mademoiselle Rochas in markets beyond the traditional Rochas markets in France and Spain. For Rochas in 2018, we plan to continue the international rollout of Mademoiselle Rochas in additional markets, debut flankers for Eau de Rochas and Mademoiselle Rochas and in 2019, launch our first new men’s line.

S.T. Dupont— In June 1997, we signed an exclusive worldwide license agreement with S.T. Dupont for the creation, manufacture and distribution of S.T. Dupont fragrances. In 2011, the agreement was renewed through December 31, 2016, and in September 2016 was renewed again through December 31, 2019, without any material changes in terms and conditions. S.T. Dupont is a French luxury goods house founded in 1872, which is known for its fine writing instruments, lighters and leather goods. S.T. Dupont fragrances include: S.T. Dupont, S.T. Dupont Essence Pure, S.T. Dupont Passenger, S.T. Dupont Passenger Cruise, 58 avenue Montaigne, So Dupont and S.T. Dupont Collection.
 
Van Cleef & Arpels— In September 2006, we entered into an exclusive 12-year worldwide license agreement for the creation, development and distribution of fragrance products under the Van Cleef & Arpels brand and related trademarks.
 
Van Cleef & Arpels fragrances in current distribution include: First, Van Cleef pour Homme, Tsar, Van Cleef, Féerie, Collection Extraordinaire, and Rêve. For 2016, we launched a new men’s line, In New York, and a new women’s line, So First. Sales of the Collection Extraordinaire line have experienced continued growth since its debut. For 2017 we introduced a new addition to the Van Cleef & Arpels Collection Extraordinaire assortment and for 2018, we are looking to add new lines to the collection. We are in discussions for an extension of the Van Cleef & Arpels license, and although we expect to agree to an extension, we cannot assure you that one will be reached.
 
Business Strategy 
 
Focus on prestige beauty brands. Prestige beauty brands are expected to contribute significantly to our growth. We focus on developing and launching quality fragrances utilizing internationally renowned brand names. By identifying and concentrating in the most receptive market segments and territories where our brands are known, and executing highly targeted launches that capture the essence of the brand, we have had a history of successful launches. Certain fashion designers and other licensors choose us as a partner, because our Company’s size enables us to work more closely with them in the product development process as well as our successful track record.
 
Grow portfolio brands through new product development and marketing. We grow through the creation of fragrance family extensions within the existing brands in our portfolio. Every year or two, we create a new family of fragrances for each brand in our portfolio. We frequently introduce seasonal and limited edition fragrances as well. With new introductions, we leverage our ability and experience to gauge trends in the market and further leverage the brand name into different product families in order to maximize sales and profit potential. We have had success in introducing new fragrance families (sub-brands, flanker brands or flankers) within our brand franchises. Furthermore, we promote the smooth and consistent performance of our prestige fragrance operations through knowledge of the market, detailed analysis of the image and potential of each brand name, a “good dose” of creativity and a highly professional approach to international distribution channels.

Continue to add new brands to our portfolio, through new licenses or acquisitions. Prestige brands are the core of our business and we intend to add new prestige beauty brands to our portfolio. Over the past twenty years, we have built our portfolio of well-known prestige brands through acquisitions and new license agreements. We intend to further build on our success in prestige fragrances and pursue new licenses and acquire new brands to strengthen our position in the prestige beauty market. To that end, during 2014, we signed fragrance licenses for Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister brands; in 2015, we signed fragrance licenses for Coach and French Connection, extended our Montblanc fragrance license and purchased the Rochas brand, and in 2016, we extended the terms of our S.T. Dupont and bebe licenses. In 2017, we extended our Jimmy Choo license through December 31, 2031 and our Paul Smith license until December 2021 and in February 2018, we signed a license agreement with GUESS?, Inc. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $278 million, which we believe should assist us in entering new brand licenses or out-right acquisitions. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into any future agreements, or acquire brands or assets on terms favorable to us, or if we do, that any such transaction will be successful. We identify prestige brands that can be developed and marketed into a full and varied product families and, with our technical knowledge and practical experience gained over time, take licensed brand names through all phases of concept, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution.
 
Expand existing portfolio into new categories. We intend to selectively broaden our product offering beyond the fragrance category and offer other fragrance related products and personal care products under some of our existing brands. We believe such product offerings meet customer needs and further strengthen customer loyalty.
 
Continue to build global distribution footprint. Our business is a global business and we intend to continue to build our global distribution footprint. In order to adapt to changes in the environment and our business, and in addition to our arrangements with third party distributors globally, we have formed and are operating distribution subsidiaries in the major markets of the United States, France, Italy and Spain for distribution of prestige fragrances. We may look into future joint arrangements or acquire distribution companies within other key markets to distribute certain of our prestige brands. While building a global distribution footprint is part of our long-term strategy, we may need to make certain decisions based on the short-term needs of the business. We believe that in certain markets, vertical integration of our distribution network may be one of the keys to future growth of our Company, and ownership of such distribution should enable us to better serve our customers’ needs in local markets and adapt more quickly as situations may determine.

Suppliers’ accounts for our European operations are primarily settled in euro and for our United States operations, suppliers’ accounts are primarily settled in U.S. dollars. For our European operations, prestige fragrances, components and contract filling needs are purchased from many different suppliers located around the world. For United States operations, components for our prestige fragrances are primarily sourced, produced and filled in the United States, and our mass market products are primarily manufactured, produced or filled in the United States or China. 
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
Our products are distributed in over 100 countries around the world through a selective distribution network. For our international distribution, we either contract with independent distribution companies specializing in luxury goods or distribute prestige products through our distribution subsidiaries. In each country, we designate anywhere from one to three distributors on an exclusive basis for one or more of our name brands. We also distribute our products through a variety of duty free operators, such as airports and airlines and select vacation destinations.

As our business is a global one, we intend to continue to build our global distribution footprint. For distribution of brands within our European based operations we operate through our distribution subsidiaries in the major markets of the United States, France, Italy and Spain, in addition to our arrangements with third party distributors globally. Our third party distributors vary in size depending on the number of competing brands they represent. This extensive and diverse network together with our own distribution subsidiaries provides us with a significant presence in over 100 countries around the world.
 
Almost 45% of our European based prestige fragrance net sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  We primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
The business of our European operations has become increasingly seasonal due to the timing of shipments by our majority-owned distribution subsidiaries to their customers, which are weighted to the second half of the year.
 
For our United States operations, we distribute product to retailers and distributors in the United States as well as internationally, including duty free and other travel-related retailers. We utilize our in-house sales team to reach our third party distributors and customers outside the United States. In addition, the business of our United States operations has become increasingly seasonal as shipments are weighted toward the second half of the year.
 
 Geographic Areas
 
United States export sales were approximately $71.4 million, $77.5 million and $66.3 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Consolidated net sales to customers by region are as follows:

Competition
 
The market for prestige fragrance products is highly competitive and sensitive to changing preferences and demands. The prestige fragrance industry is highly concentrated around certain major players with resources far greater than ours. We compete with an original strategy, regular and methodical development of quality fragrances for a growing portfolio of internationally renowned brand names.
 Inventory
 
We purchase raw materials and component parts from suppliers based on internal estimates of anticipated need for finished goods, which enables us to meet production requirements for finished goods. We generally deliver product to customers within 72 hours of the receipt of their orders. Our business is not capital intensive, and it is important to note that we do not own manufacturing facilities. We act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers. These components are received at one of our distribution centers and then, based upon production needs, the components are sent to one of several third party fillers which manufacture the finished product for us and then deliver them to one of our distribution centers.
 Product Liability
 
Our United States operations maintain product liability coverage in an amount of $10.0 million, and our European operations maintain product liability coverage in an amount of €20.0 million (approximately $24.0 million). Based upon our experience, we believe this coverage is adequate and covers substantially all of the exposure we may have with respect to our products. We have never been the subject of any material product liability claims. 
Government Regulation
 
A fragrance is defined as a “cosmetic” under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. A fragrance must comply with the labeling requirements of this FDC Act as well as the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and its regulations. Some of our color cosmetic products may contain menthol and are also classified as a “drug”. Under U.S. law, a product may be classified as both a cosmetic and a drug. Additional regulatory requirements for products which are “drugs” include additional labeling requirements, registration of the manufacturer and the semi-annual update of a drug list. In addition, various jurisdictions prohibit the use of certain ingredients in fragrances and cosmetics.
 
 16



Our fragrances are subject to the approval of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as a result of the use of specially denatured alcohol. So far we have not experienced any difficulties in obtaining the required approvals.
 
Our fragrance products that are manufactured or sold in Europe are subject to certain regulatory requirements of the European Union, such as Cosmetic Directive 76/768/CEE and Regulation number 1223/2009 on cosmetic products, but as of the date of this report, we have not experienced any material difficulties in complying with such requirements.
 
Trademarks
 
The market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our trademarks and brand names. We have licenses or other rights to use, or own, the material trademark and brand name rights used in connection with the packaging, marketing and distribution of our major products both in the United States and in other countries where such products are principally sold. Therefore, trademark and brand name protection is important to our business. Although most of the brand names we license, use or own are registered in the United States and in certain foreign countries in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark or brand name protection. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The costs required to protect our trademarks and brand names may be substantial.
 
Under various license and other agreements we have the right to use certain registered trademarks throughout the world (except as otherwise noted) for fragrance products. These registered trademarks include:
 

● | Abercrombie & Fitch 
--+--------------------------------
● | Agent Provocateur 
● | Anna Sui 
● | bebe

● | Dunhill

In addition, we are the registered trademark owner of several trademarks for fragrance and beauty products, including:

● | Intimate
● | Aziza 

Employees
 
As of March 1, 2018, we had 355 full-time employees worldwide. Of these, 266 are full-time employees of our European operations, with 109 employees engaged in sales activities and 157 in administrative, production and marketing activities. Our United States operations have 89 employees, and of these, 13 were engaged in sales activities and 76 in administrative, production and marketing activities. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
