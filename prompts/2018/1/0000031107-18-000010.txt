ITEM 1 | BUSINESS
-------+---------



(a)  General Development of Business
 
The Eastern Company (the "Company," "Eastern," "we," "us," or "our") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Connecticut in October, 1912, succeeding a co-partnership established in October, 1858. The business of the Company is the design, manufacture and sale of industrial hardware, security products and metal products.
 
Today, the Company maintains sixteen physical locations across North America and Asia.
 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
On April 3, 2017, the Company completed a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Securities Purchase Agreement") with Velvac Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Velvac"), Jeffery R. Porter, W. Greg Bland, John Backovitch, Dave Otto, Bob Otto, Timothy Rintelman, Robert Brester, Dan Mcgrew, Mark Moeller, and Prospect Partners II, L.P. (collectively, the "Sellers"). Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding stock of Velvac from the Sellers (the "Velvac Acquisition") for $39.5 million and an earnout consideration contingent upon Velvac achieving minimum earnings performance levels and based on sales of Velvac's new proprietary Road-iQ product line (the "Earnout Consideration"). The Velvac Acquisition was financed with a $31 million term loan from People's United Bank, National Association ("People's"), a $5 million draw down on the Company's $10 million revolving credit facility with People's and $3.5 million in cash. In addition, the Company paid a working capital adjustment of $0.6 million by which working capital exceeded a pre-determined target amount. Please refer to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 7, 2017 and the amendment thereto filed on June 19, 2017 for further details.
 
 (b)  Financial Information about Industry Segments
 
Financial information about industry segments is included in Note 10 to the Company's financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
 
(c)  Narrative Description of Business
 
The Eastern Company actively manages niche industrial divisions that focus on the design, manufacture and sale of particular products and industrial services and are leaders in their specific market sector.  We believe Eastern's divisions operate in industries with long-term macroeconomic growth opportunities, have positive and stable cash flows, face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence, and have strong management teams largely in place.
 
Eastern focuses on proactive financial and operational management of its divisions in order to increase earnings and increase long-term shareholder value. Among other things, Eastern regularly monitors financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline and assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic growth strategies.

Eastern also identifies and works with division management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities.  In addition, Eastern recruits and retains talented managers to operate its divisions.
 
Eastern continuously reviews acquisitions of businesses that have the potential for significant long-term value creation and periodically evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing divisions and investments.  We seek to acquire businesses that produce stable and growing earnings and cash flows.  Eastern may pursue acquisitions in industries other than those in which its divisions currently operate if an acquisition presents an attractive opportunity.
 
The Company operates in three business segments: Industrial Hardware, Security Products and Metal Products.
 
Industrial Hardware
 
The Industrial Hardware business segment consists of Eberhard Manufacturing, Eberhard Hardware Manufacturing Ltd., Eastern Industrial Ltd, Velvac, Canadian Commercial Vehicles Corporation, Composite Panel Technologies and Sesamee Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. These divisions design, manufacture and market a diverse product line of custom and standard vehicular and industrial hardware, including passenger restraint and vehicular locks, latches, hinges, mirrors, mirror-cameras, light-weight sleeper boxes and truck bodies. These products can be found on tractor-trailer trucks, specialty commercial vehicles, recreational vehicles, fire and rescue vehicles, school buses, military vehicles and other vehicles. In addition, the segment designs and manufactures a wide selection of fasteners and other closure devices used to secure access doors on various types of industrial equipment such as metal cabinets, machinery housings and electronic instruments. The segment sells directly to original equipment manufacturers and to distributors through in-house salesmen and outside sales representatives. Sales, customer engineering and customer service are provided through in-house sales personnel and engineering staff. We believe that in order to service these markets, our divisions offer competitive engineering design, service, quality and price. In addition, we invest in the continued introduction of new or improved product designs and we expand into synergistic product lines in order to maintain and increase market share.
Security Products
 
The Security Products business segment consists of Illinois Lock Company/CCL Security Products, World Lock Company Ltd., Dongguan Reeworld Security Products Ltd., World Security Industries Ltd., Greenwald Industries ("Greenwald"), and Argo EMS (formerly Argo Transdata). Illinois Lock Company/CCL Security Products designs, manufactures and distributes custom engineered and standard closing and locking systems, including vehicular accessory locks, cabinet locks, cam locks, electric switch locks, tubular key locks and combination padlocks. Some of its products are sold under the names SESAMEE®, PRESTOLOCK® and SEARCHALERT™. These products are sold to original equipment manufacturers, distributors, route operators, and locksmiths through in-house salesmen and outside sales representatives. Greenwald manufactures and markets coin acceptors and other coin security products used primarily in the commercial laundry markets. Greenwald's products include timers, drop meters, coin chutes, money boxes, meter cases, smart cards, value transfer stations, smart card readers, card management software, and access control units. Argo EMS supplies printed circuit boards and other electronic assemblies to original equipment manufacturers in various industries, including measurement systems, semiconductor equipment manufacturing, and industrial controls, medical and military products. The Security Products segment continuously seeks new markets where it can offer competitive engineered solutions that meet manufacturers' security needs.
Metal Products
 
The Company believes that its Metal Products business segment, based at the Company's Frazer & Jones facility, is the largest and most efficient producer of expansion shells for use in supporting the roofs of underground mines. This segment also manufactures specialty malleable and ductile iron castings.
 
Typical products include mine roof support anchors, couplers for railroad braking systems, support anchoring for construction and couplers/fittings for utility (oil, water and gas) industries. Mine roof support anchors are sold to bolt manufacturers while specialty castings are sold to original equipment manufacturers or machine houses. Frazer & Jones will not be effected by the new metals tariff since all metals are purchased domestically.
 
General
 
The Company obtains materials from domestic, Asian affiliated and nonaffiliated sources. Raw materials and outside services were readily available for all of the Company's segments during 2017 and are expected to be readily available in 2018 and the foreseeable future. In 2017, the Company experienced price increases for many of the raw materials used in producing its products, including: scrap iron, zinc, brass and stainless steel.  In 2016, the Company experienced a price decline for many of these same materials.  At this time, the Company expects raw material prices to continue to increase as demand for raw materials increases

as the global economy grows.  These raw material cost increases could negatively impact the Company's gross margin if raw material prices increase too rapidly for the Company to recover those cost increases through either price increases to our customers or cost reductions in other areas of the business.
 
Patent and trademark protection for the various product lines within the Company is limited, but believed by the Company to be sufficient to protect the Company's competitive positions.  No business segment is dependent on any patent nor would the loss of any patent have any material adverse effect on the Company's business.  Foreign sales are not significant.
 
None of the Company's division segments are seasonal.
 
Customers for all business segments are broad-based geographically and by markets, and sales are generally not highly concentrated by customer.  No one customer exceeded 10% of total consolidated sales in 2017, 2016 or 2015.
 
The dollar amount of the backlog of orders received by the Company is believed to be firm as of the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017. Such backlogs was $34,991,000 at December 30, 2017, as compared to $26,993,000 at December 31, 2016.  The primary reasons for the change from 2016 to 2017 were the acquisition of Velvac on April 3, 2017 and the timing of orders received from customers.
 
The Company encounters competition in all of its business segments. Imports from Asia and Latin America with favorable currency exchange rates and low cost labor have created additional pricing pressure. The Company competes successfully by offering high quality custom engineered products on a timely basis. To compete, the Company deploys internal engineering resources, maintains cost effective manufacturing capabilities through its wholly-owned Asian subsidiaries, expands its product lines through product development and acquisitions, and maintains sufficient inventory for fast turnaround of customer orders.
 
Research and development expenditures in 2017 were $3,678,000 and represented 1.8% of gross revenues.  In 2016 and 2015, such expenditures were $1,526,000 and $1,219,000, respectively.  The research and developments costs are primarily attributable to the Velvac and Eberhard Manufacturing divisions. Velvac performs ongoing research, in both the mechanical and electronic product lines, and in RoadIQ. This research is necessary for the Company to remain competitive and to continue to provide technologically advanced electronic systems. Eberhard Manufacturing develops new products for the various markets it serves based on changing customer requirements to remain competitive. Other research projects include the development of various latches and rotaries and various transportation and industrial hardware products.
 
The Company does not anticipate that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations is likely to have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 
The average number of employees in 2017 was 1,189.
 
The Company's ratio of working capital to sales improved in 2017 to 33.7% from 47.1% in 2016 and 41.6% in 2015. The improvement in working capital was the result of a reduction in inventory in the Metal business segment and partially the result of the Velvac acquisition.  Working capital includes cash held in various foreign subsidiaries.  With the passage of recent tax legislation cash previously held in foreign countries can be repatriated back to the United States and used for other business needs thus reducing working capital further.  Other factors affecting working capital include our average days' sales in accounts receivable, inventory turnover ratio and payment of vendor accounts payable.  In some cases, the company must hold extra inventory due to extended lead time in receiving products ordered from our foreign subsidiaries to ensure product is available for our customers.  The Company continues to monitor its working capital needs with the goal of reducing our ratio of working capital to sales to 25%.
