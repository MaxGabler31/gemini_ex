ITEM 1. Business
Overview
 
CSSE is a growing media company building online video on-demand (“VOD”) networks that provide positive and entertaining video content for all screens. We also curate, produce and distribute long and short-form video content that brings out the best of the human spirit, and distribute the online content of our affiliate, A Plus. We are aggressively growing our business through a combination of organic growth, licensing and distribution arrangements, acquisitions, and strategic relationships. We are also expanding our partnerships with sponsors, television networks and independent producers. Our subsidiary, Screen Media, is a leading global independent television and film distribution company, which owns one of the largest independently owned television and film libraries. We also own Popcornflix®, a popular online advertiser-supported VOD (“AVOD”) network, and four additional AVOD networks, which collectively have rights to exhibit thousands of movies and television episodes.


We have an exclusive, perpetual and worldwide license from our parent, CSS, a publishing and consumer products company, to create and distribute video content under the Chicken Soup for the Soul® brand (the “Brand”).
 
We operate in three areas:
 

· | Online Networks. In this segment, we distribute and exhibit video on-demand content directly to consumers across all digital platforms, such as smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles and the web through our Popcornflix and A Plus networks. Popcornflix had 15 million active users in 2017.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Television and Film Distribution. In this segment, we distribute movies and television series worldwide to consumers through license agreements across all media, including theatrical, home video, pay-per-view, free, cable and pay television, VOD and new digital media platforms worldwide. We own the copyright or long-term distribution rights to more than 1,200 television series and feature films.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Television and Short-Form Video Production. In this segment, we partner with sponsors and use highly regarded independent producers to develop and produce our video content, including Brand-related content.

Since our inception in January 2015, our business has grown rapidly. For the full year 2017, our net revenue was $10.7 million, as compared to 2016 net revenue for the full year of $8.1 million. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Screen Media in November 2017. We had net income of $22.8 million for the full year 2017, as compared to a full year net income of $0.8 million in 2016. Our 2017 Adjusted EBITDA was $28.3 million for the full year, as compared to full year 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 million. The full year 2017 included a gain on bargain purchase of $24.3 million relating to the acquisition of Screen Media, as discussed below in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
Business Strategy
 
Our vision is to use our solid core of traditional media production and distribution assets to build a powerful portfolio of online VOD networks and assets. Our production and distribution businesses generate current revenue and Adjusted EBITDA to fund our rapidly growing online networks. We will build and acquire assets such as content libraries, digital publishers with content related to our own, and stand-alone VOD networks.

One of our fundamental objectives is to continue to grow our VOD networks to create a “network of networks” as we continue to grow our content offerings to critical mass. Our strategy is to build our library of video content through a combination of Chicken Soup for the Soul original video content and opportunistic acquisitions of third-party video content libraries, such as our transformative acquisition of Screen Media, or other rights to video content as distressed networks seek to monetize their content libraries.


Online Networks
 
Our acquisition of Screen Media accelerated our entry into the direct-to-consumer online VOD market through Popcornflix. Popcornflix has an extensive footprint with apps that have been downloaded approximately 24 million times. Popcornflix had 15 million active users in 2017.
 
Popcornflix is one of the largest AVOD services. Under the Popcornflix brand, we operate a series of direct-to consumer advertising supported channels. On Popcornflix, we have the rights to exhibit more than 3,000 films and approximately 60 television series comprised of approximately 1,500 episodes, with new content added regularly. As a “free-to-consumer” digital streaming channel, Popcornflix is an extremely popular online video platform that can be found on the web, iPhones and iPads, Android products, Roku , Xbox, Amazon Fire, Apple TV, Chromecast and Samsung and Panasonic internet connected televisions, among others. Popcornflix is currently available in 56 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Scandinavia, Germany, France, Hong Kong, and Singapore, with additional territories to be added.
 
While Popcornflix is currently an advertiser-supported VOD network, we expect to add subscriber-based networks in the future.


In addition to Popcornflix, we derive online networks revenue from our exclusive distribution relationship with A Plus, our affiliate, which develops and distributes high-quality, empathetic short-form videos and articles to millions of people worldwide. Our distribution relationship with A Plus allows us to accelerate the growth of our offering by providing us with content developed and distributed by A Plus that is complementary to the Brand.
 
Television and Film Distribution
 
We distribute television series and films worldwide through Screen Media. We own the copyright or long-term distribution rights to more than 1,200 television series and feature films, representing one of the largest independently owned libraries of filmed entertainment in the world. We distribute our television series and films through license agreements across all media, including theatrical, home video, pay-per-view, free, cable and pay television, VOD and emerging digital media platforms worldwide.
 
Screen Media’s distribution capabilities across all media will allow us to distribute our produced television series directly and eliminate the distribution fees (as much as 30% of revenue) that we currently pay to third parties for distribution of the rights we retain when we produce series with our sponsors. We believe that the cost savings from Screen Media’s distribution capabilities will enhance our revenue and profits from our produced television series.


The Company has distribution licensing agreements with numerous VOD services across all major platform, such as cable and satellite VOD and Internet VOD, which includes TVOD for rentals or purchases of films, AVOD for free-to-viewer streaming of films supported by advertisements and SVOD for unlimited access to films for a monthly fee.
 
Our cable and satellite VOD distribution agreements include those with Time Warner Cable, DirecTV, Spectrum, Vubiquity and In Demand. Our Internet VOD distribution agreements include those with Amazon, iTunes, Samsung, YouTube, Hulu, Xbox, Netflix, Sony, and Vudu, among others.
 
We are rapidly expanding international distribution of our content through agreements with iTunes, Sony PlayStation, Xbox, and Viasat, among others. Under these agreements, our titles are available on iTunes, Sony PlayStation and Xbox in the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, Italy and Hong Kong with additional territories added regularly.
 
Television and Short-Form Video Production
 
We utilize the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand, together with our management’s industry experience and expertise, to generate revenue through the production and distribution of video content. The Company partners with sponsors and uses highly-regarded independent producers to develop and produce video content. Using this approach provides us with access to a diverse pool of creative ideas for new video content projects and allows us to scale our business on a variable cost basis. We currently have producer agreements or arrangements in place with a number of these producers, including Litton Entertainment (a Hearst company). We anticipate entering into relationships with additional independent producers.
 
We seek committed funding from corporate and foundation sponsors covering more than the production costs prior to moving forward with a project. Since we seek to secure both the committed funding and production capabilities for our video content prior to moving forward with a project, we have high visibility into the profitability of a particular project before committing to proceed with such project. In addition, we take limited financial risk on developing our projects.
 
Corporate and foundation sponsors with which we work include HomeAway, Hilton Grand Vacations, American Humane, BISSELL Homecare, Inc., the Boniuk Foundation, Michelson Found Animals Foundation and the Morgridge Family Foundation, and we are currently in discussions with numerous others. We endeavor to retain meaningful back-end rights to our video content in these relationships, which provides opportunities for improved profitability and enhances our library value.

Our long-form video content consists of 30- to 60-minute episodic programs typically distributed initially on traditional television or cable networks. Our current long-form video content projects include:
 

• | Chicken Soup for the Soul’s Hidden Heroes (‘‘Hidden Heroes’’). The multi-award winning Hidden Heroes is hosted by Brooke Burke-Charvet and is currently airing its third season on The CW Network. A segment of Hidden Heroes can be seen at https://cssentertainment.com/hiddenheroes. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Being Dad, a Chicken Soup for the Soul Original Series (“Being Dad”). This series is an intimate, revealing and entertaining portrait of nine men who are tackling one of the most important roles in the world: fatherhood. The episodes are about the lives of dads who are facing challenges that are simultaneously unique and universal. For example, a farmer teaches his teenage daughter to drive; a single dad re-enters the dating scene; a touring rock musician takes his family with him on the road; an over-protective dad struggles with his autistic daughter’s growing independence; and gay dads deal with the emotional complexities of adoption. All the fathers are different ages, races, and religions; however, they are all bound by the singular belief that raising their children is life’s greatest gift.

• | Vacation Rental Potential.

Hosted by Holly Baker, Vacation Rental Potential offers people insight on how to make the dream of vacation homeownership possible. The show premiered on A&E Network in December 2017.

Our short-form video content, including our branded short-form video content known as Sips, is typically exhibited through online video content distribution and social media platforms, such as YouTube, Facebook, Yahoo, Diply, Gateway Media, SheKnows, Rumble and Liquid Social among others, as well as on the social media of Chicken Soup for the Soul and our sponsors.
 
Competition
 
Video content production and distribution direct to consumers are highly competitive businesses. We face competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, outdoor recreation, video games, the internet and other cultural and computer-related activities. We compete with the major studios, numerous independent motion picture and television distribution and production companies, television networks, pay television systems and online media platforms for the services of performing artists, producers and other creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our businesses.
 
In addition, our video content competes for media outlet and audience acceptance with video content produced and distributed by other companies. As a result, the success of any of our video content is dependent not only on the quality and acceptance of a particular production, but also on the quality and acceptance of other competing video content available in the marketplace at or near the same time.
 
Given such competition, and our stage of development, we intend to initially emphasize a lower cost structure, risk mitigation, reliance on financial partnerships and innovative financial strategies. Our cost structures are designed to utilize our flexibility and agility as well as the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees, partners and affiliates, in order to provide creative, desirable video content.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We are party to the CSS License Agreement (as defined) through which we have been granted the perpetual, exclusive, worldwide license by CSS to produce and distribute video content using the brand and related content, such as stories published in the Chicken Soup for the Soul books. Chicken Soup for the Soul and related names are trademarks owned by CSS. We have the proprietary rights (including copyrights) in all our Sips and company-produced content. With the acquisition of Screen Media, the Company now owns copyrights or global long-term distribution rights to Screen Media film library as well as ownership of Screen Media’s AVOD application Popcornflix.
 
We rely on a combination of confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 32 direct employees. The services of certain personnel, including our chairman and chief executive officer, vice chairman and chief strategy officer, our senior brand advisor and director, and chief financial officer, are provided to us under the CSS Management Agreement. We also utilize many consultants in the ordinary course of our business and hire additional personnel on a project-by-project basis. We believe that our employee and labor relations are good, and we are committed to inclusion and strict policies and procedures to maintain a safe work environment.

Corporate Information
 
We are a Delaware corporation formed on May 4, 2016. CSS Productions, our predecessor and immediate parent company, was formed in December 2014 by CSS, and initiated operations in January 2015. We were formed to create a discrete entity focused on video content opportunities using the Brand. In connection with our succession to the operations of CSS Productions, all video content assets owned by CSS and any of its affiliates, including all rights and obligations related thereto, were transferred to us upon formation on May 4, 2016. Thereafter, CSS Productions’ operating activities ceased, and the Company continued the business operations of producing and distributing the video content.
 
In May 2016, pursuant to the terms of the contribution agreement among CSS, CSS Productions and the Company (the “CSS Contribution Agreement”), all video content assets (the “Subject Assets”) owned by CSS, CSS Productions and their CSS subsidiaries were transferred to the Company in consideration for its issuance to CSS Productions of 8,600,568 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock. Since the date of the CSS Contribution Agreement, CSS Productions has transferred certain of these shares of Class B common stock to third parties in certain transactions. Concurrently with the consummation of the CSS Contribution Agreement, certain rights to receive payments under certain agreements comprising part of the Subject Assets owned by Trema, LLC (“Trema”), a company principally owned and controlled by William J. Rouhana, Jr., the Company’s chairman and chief executive officer, were assigned to the Company under a contribution agreement (the “Trema Contribution Agreement”) in consideration for the Company’s issuance to Trema of 159,432 shares or our Class B common stock.
 
Thereafter, CSS Productions’ operating activities ceased, and the Company continued the business operations of producing and distributing the video content.
 
The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has irrevocably elected to avail itself of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
Internet Address and Availability of Filings
 
We maintain a website at www.cssentertainment.com. The Company makes available, free of charge, on or through its internet website, the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or (15)(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company complied with this policy for every Securities Exchange Act of 1934 report filed during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company”, as defined in the JOBS Act, and, for so long as we are an emerging growth company, are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These include, but are not limited to:

• | Not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors’ report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We may remain an “emerging growth company” until as late as December 31, 2022, the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if (a) we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue in any fiscal year, (b) the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 or (c) we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have chosen to irrevocably “opt out” of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards as required when they are adopted.
