ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Overview 
 One Stop Systems (OSS) designs, manufactures and markets high-end systems for high performance computing (“HPC”) applications. We combine state-of-the art components from major technology providers to design and manufacture purpose-built systems that allow our customers to exploit Big Data opportunities faster and more efficiently. HPC applications require ultra-fast processing power and the ability to quickly access and store ever-growing data sets. We are uniquely positioned as a specialized provider for the high-end of this marketplace providing custom servers, compute accelerators, solid-state storage arrays and system expansion systems. We deliver this high-end technology to our customers through the sale of equipment and software for use on a customer’s premises or through remote cloud access to secure datacenters housing our technology. 
 The worldwide HPC market is expected to grow from $35.6 billion in 2016 to $43.9 billion by 2021, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.3%. We are establishing a leading position as a provider of HPC servers, compute accelerators and flash storage arrays to the high-end of this growing marketplace. Today, we believe we are one of the largest providers of PCIe over cable adapters and expansion systems used worldwide. PCIe is the high performance communication protocol or bus between components which can also be used between boxes for the highest performance and lowest latency. We supply systems that attach to both existing servers through PCIe cables as well as all-in-one systems with the server, Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) computing and Solid State Devices (SSD) storage all included in a single product. OSS systems offer high performance in a physically dense packaging, enabling our customers to build massive compute and storage clusters that occupy less space and require less power and cooling than conventional systems. We also sell software used to operate flash-based storage systems for defense systems and commercial applications. 
 The more GPUs and flash-based storage devices available to a server, the faster it can process, store, and retrieve data. PCIe is increasingly the preferred technology for connecting system components together. We have built leading edge expertise in PCIe expansion technology and leveraged it to design and build systems that offer a higher quantity and density of GPUs and flash devices than competing suppliers. 
 A key element of our product strategy is technological market leadership. We believe a first-to-market strategy is key to our ability to continue to win significant OEM design wins. As a result, we are constantly developing new state-of-the-art products that are often based on components that do not yet exist. Our ability to drive the leading edge of technology is enabled by our strong relationships with strategic component manufactures, particularly Intel (for CPUs), NVIDIA (for GPUs), Western Digital (for SSD) and Broadcom (for PCIe switch components). In each of these cases, OSS has special access (under non-disclosure agreements) to product roadmaps and other technical information relating to future technology. Access to this information allows us to begin our design process well before the future components we are designing for even exist. This accelerates our time-to-market, and allows us to produce and release state-of-the-art designs well ahead of our competitors. 
 Today, HPC applications are moving beyond the traditional academic and scientific realms to broad application in enterprise applications across the spectrum of vertical markets. These applications include computationally intense areas like artificial intelligence (“AI”), deep learning, seismic exploration, predictive analytics, medical imaging, genomics, cyber security and defense. We are well positioned to leverage these market megatrends and capitalize on our unique core competencies in high speed system design. We have a proven track record of delivering first-to-market the latest and most advanced technologies and have continued to do so recently with high-end GPU accelerators and high-performance SSD arrays with light-weight removable high-capacity canisters. These products fit solidly into the emerging HPC market. 
 OSS sells its products worldwide to industry leading customers like Cisco, disguise (formerly d3), National Instruments, Northrop Grumman, Oracle and Raytheon. We are a strategic partner to technology leaders that include Intel, NVIDIA, Western Digital, and Broadcom, whose technology is integrated into our products. We are investing in new adjacent segments to our core product lines, including HPC storage management software and HPC cloud services. We anticipate continued market growth in our target markets and sustaining the ability to increase market share through leadership technology, engineering expertise, supply chain management and go-to-market innovation.

 Industry Background 
 High Performance Computing (HPC) refers to computing solutions capable of processing large amounts of data and storing and retrieving that data at speeds 10-1,000 times faster than a typical personal computer. Increasingly, commercial companies, financial entities, governmental agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD), and academic institutions are turning to HPC solutions to analyze vast amounts of data and to quickly obtain meaningful and actionable insights. Traditional computing systems using CPUs (Central Processing Units) are inefficient in quickly processing large data sets of information. Two technologies, GPU computing, and flash memory, enable systems to process and store data more efficiently than traditional systems. By harnessing large quantities of these components, companies can receive necessary data analysis much more quickly. Industry experts typically divide the HPC market into the following categories: 

• | Servers – This market represents all HPC servers, which is composed of Supercomputers (>$500,000 per unit), Divisional Servers ($250,000-$500,000), Departmental Servers ($100,000-$250,000), and Workgroup Servers (<$100,000 per unit).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Storage – This includes both traditional hard disc drives and flash storage devices.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Middleware – A broad category encompassing programming environments, schedulers, and other tools outside the operating system.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Applications – Specific applications for high performance computing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Services – All services associated with high performance computing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

--+--------------------


• | Weather Forecasting
--+--------------------

 These industry sectors expect to deploy increasingly faster computing environments to meet industry and competitive goals. GPU computer acceleration and high-density flash storage are key subsets of the HPC market. 
 GPU Compute Acceleration 
 The capabilities and speed of GPU accelerated computers are beginning to drive significant advances in AI and machine learning. Massive amounts of data, when analyzed by today’s sophisticated algorithms, able to reveal unique patterns and insights. AI and machine learning are poised to transform worldwide business, as advances in computing speed and storage come together to enable businesses to solve complex problems. 
High Density Solid-State Storage 
 The market for solid-state drives is large and growing. According to a study by MarketsandMarkets, a market research firm, the flash drive market is growing at 9.5% per year and is expected to reach $25.3 billion by 2022. The proliferation of larger and larger databases, virtualized servers, virtual desktop servers, analytic application servers, and other server configurations are feeding the need for faster and faster ways to access the data being produced or mined. 
 Traditionally, companies have used hard disk drive technology that has proved more than adequate as the price for these drives have continued to drop as the associated capacities have risen. This was especially true when the amounts of data generated were relatively low, and users were satisfied with the comparatively slow data retrieval and processing that traditional hard disk drives offered. Today, the huge amount of data being generated requires categorization, storage and ready access. The advent of flash drives has given the industry a new device that has faster access time, greater reliability, lower power consumption, lower noise, smaller size and less heat generation.

These drives are especially useful in the field of high performance computing, where one is generally dealing with larger amounts of data and/or the need for complex calculations to be completed very rapidly. In either case, speed and efficiency are paramount. Military systems, for example, generate vast amounts of data using sensor systems, radar systems, cryptanalysis, targeting systems, microwave communications, and a myriad of other applications. This data needs to be collected, analyzed and acted upon in a real-time environment. 
 Key Components of Our Business 
 Product Development 
 Our systems are built using the latest GPU and flash storage technologies and draw upon years of expertise in designing and manufacturing semi-custom systems for OEMs. We have a history of being first to market with many solutions for emerging technologies. OSS first began designing and manufacturing custom systems for defense, manufacturing, and telecommunications customers. When PCIe (the interconnect used in most computers today) was first introduced by Intel Corporation in 2005, we were first to produce PCIe over cable adapters allowing system-to-system communication at incredible speeds. Today, we are one of the largest providers of PCIe adapters and expansion components used worldwide. 
 When GPU technology and solid-state flash were first introduced, we began designing systems that maximized the effectiveness of these technologies. We now produce compute systems with large numbers of GPUs and flash memory to allow faster processing and data storage and retrieval. The more GPUs and flash devices available to a server the faster that system can process and store/recover data, thus saving time and money for those applications. A readily recognized example is video imaging in defense applications when quickly knowing battlefield parameters is paramount. 
 We use leading edge, state-of-the art components from major technology providers to design purpose-built systems that solve customer problems in an efficient, cost-effective manner. We do not design silicon chips, but instead apply the technology provided by Intel, NVIDIA, Western Digital, Broadcom and others to deliver customer driven designs to provide true value to our customers. 
 Worldwide Sales 
 We provide our products on a worldwide basis and are supported through a network of reseller and distribution partners. Sales in North America are predominately driven by our direct sales force whereas European and Asian sales are driven through distributors. 
 In June 2015, we formed our wholly-owned subsidiary One Stop Systems, GmbH (“OSS GmbH”), located in Gröbenzell, Germany. It operates a regional facility formed to service customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. OSS GmbH was established to service OSS GmbH regional customers with faster product delivery, application engineering services and technical support. Our facility is centrally located outside of Munich, in a tech-rich region easily accessible to all of Europe and within just a few time zones of the Middle East and Africa. The office is staffed with knowledgeable technical personnel who can quickly resolve customer issues and facilitate quick delivery of their products. This facility also gives us the opportunity to provide an OEM warehousing location, as well as a service depot for equipment repair and rework that serves our growing customer base located outside of the United States. 
 New Business Initiatives 
 On April 6, 2017, OSS formed SkyScale, LLC (“SkyScale”), a HPC as a Service (HPCaaS) provider to offer customers world-class, ultra-fast, multi-GPU hardware platforms in the cloud. SkyScale is a 50/50 joint venture between OSS and Jacoma Investments, LLC, an entity affiliated with a member of our board of directors, which allows customers to lease state-of-the-art high performance computing hardware. SkyScale’s cloud services provide a compelling value proposition for customers who want the fastest computing performance available, but may not have the budget or infrastructure available to support a full-time HPC system. SkyScale provides that infrastructure, including common HPC applications at a fraction of the cost of the full-time system. The customer gets access to their own infrastructure in the cloud, which is available 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. This is our first foray into the 
 5

growing “Infrastructure as a Service” (IaaS) market, and is expected to produce strong growth for OSS in the future. The SkyScale datacenter utilizes OSS servers and GPU compute accelerators. These systems can be clustered and scaled in the cloud to provide companies with the desired computing power for their high performance application requirements. As a key part of our strategy, this creates demand for the systems we build (as they are used by SkyScale), revenues from the service itself, exposure to a potential customer for our products as they grow, and our increased involvement on the software front. 
 On May 9, 2017, OSS entered into an agreement to acquire the source code license to the Ion SSD software from Western Digital. We plan to continue to develop and sell Ion software with our high-density storage arrays, as well as servicing existing Western Digital software users. OSS Ion software works with our all-flash storage systems, and provides them with a critical point of differentiation with respect to speed and throughput. The OSS Ion software leverages flash storage and open server hardware to accelerate applications and storage-area network performance through sharing or clustering high-speed all-flash storage arrays. The software supports many major OEM servers and provides an intuitive interface for system users to manage its many features. Having the Ion software source code and engineering team on-board allows us to strategically grow our all-flash storage business in the many Big Data and HPC markets as well as increases our software content over time. 
 What Sets OSS Apart 
 Several factors differentiate OSS from other suppliers of HPC solutions: 
  
• | Our expertise in PCIe expansion and building custom systems allows us to design reliable systems using this challenging highest performance technology with a greater quantity of GPUs and flash storage devices than other suppliers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We design systems that both attach to existing servers through PCIe over cable leveraging our customer’s existing investments as well as all-in-one systems with the server, GPU computing and flash storage device all included in a single package.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our systems can be clustered together to build massive compute engines that occupy less space and power than conventional systems driving performance up and costs down for our customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We produce the software required to operate high-capacity, low-latency storage systems used by defense systems and commercial applications and expect this will expand into other products in the future.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our business model utilizes our products in two ways: 
  
• | We sell systems to OEM customers who use them in their own data centers for their own applications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We (via SkyScale) lease space on our own systems in our own data center for customers who prefer not to make the infrastructure investment require for owning their own systems.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our niche is to provide reliable purpose-built platforms with the latest GPUs and flash storage devices that allow servers to access large numbers of these devices. 
 Business Strategy 
 We have traditionally followed a strategy of being first-to-market in leading edge technologies by designing and developing products that are delivered before our competitors. This market leader strategy is accomplished through what we term a “Catch the Wave” approach to the market. We currently have products and derivatives in the flash storage, GPU acceleration, and PCIe expansion markets. Within these three distinct market areas the OSS “Catch the Wave” approach implies that we: 

• | anticipate trends in these markets;
--+------------------------------------


• | consistently deploy resources in engineering and sales to bring innovative products to market before our competitors react;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6

 
• | work closely and leverage strategic component supplies to get early access to future products and technologies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | seek to procure early “design wins”, establishing the standard before our competitors can react; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continually survey the market for complementary technologies for which a new “Wave” may be forming.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategy 
 OSS intends to continue its rapid growth through three avenues: 
  
• | Ramp-up of Existing OEM and Military Design-wins
--+-------------------------------------------------

 Many of our design wins are in the early stages, and we anticipate significant revenue growth as they move into full production. 
  
• | Winning New OEM and Military Program Designs
--+---------------------------------------------

 Our technology leadership provides the “in” to many potential OEM relationships. As we continue to grow the Company, our capabilities and market recognition also grow rapidly, providing even more opportunities for OEM and military program design-ins. 
  
• | Acquisitions of strategic companies
--+------------------------------------

 OSS has an experienced team that has negotiated and managed numerous acquisitions of smaller companies. We have identified more than a dozen firms that we believe have potential to be acquired and provide significant, accretive value to OSS. Some of the proceeds from our initial public offering will assist in our acquisition activities by providing cash and stock which can be used selectively in future transactions. 
 OSS is using the following criteria for potential acquisition targets: 
  
• | Target has a presence in our served or desired markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Target’s products can be easily integrated into our product portfolio and/or product roadmap resulting in an accretive benefit to our existing position.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Target should be profitable with positive cash flow at the outset or shortly following the acquisition.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Target’s products can provide $5-$15 million in incremental revenue.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Target is relatively proximate, geographically to OSS in Southern California.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Will consider companies that can extend our markets geographically.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Will consider companies that have an existing incremental services revenue stream.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our acquisition strategy has the following benefits for OSS and our stockholders: 
  
• | Immediate acquisition of new customers and products. Acquisition of new engineering, sales, administrative and operations personnel.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The increase in size and scale of OSS which can be leveraged to lower overall costs and drive up margins/profits.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased credibility with customers, vendors, and suppliers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 We plan to allocate some of the proceeds from our initial public offering to acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, services or technologies and working capital. At this time, however, we have not yet identified specific acquisition targets.

Our Opportunity 
 The worldwide HPC market is expected to grow from $35.6 billion in 2016 to $43.9 billion by 2021. Within this market, OSS is positioned in the highest performance and fastest growing portion of the market including the server (custom and GPU accelerators), storage (flash arrays), PCIe expansion and adapters, and services sectors. The service sector is addressed with services being delivered over the cloud as Infrastructure as a Service, (IaaS). We will address each of these sectors below: 

• | Custom Built Servers
--+---------------------


• | GPU Compute Accelerators
--+-------------------------


• | All Flash Arrays
--+-----------------


• | PCIe Expansion and Adaptors
--+----------------------------


• | Cloud Services (IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service)
--+----------------------------------------------------

Custom Built Servers 
 Within the server sector, OSS has secured a niche position of building purpose-built specialty servers, which the major server suppliers choose not to supply as they require custom tuning and special features that major OEMs cannot easily provide. Such flexibility is difficult to maintain for major suppliers because their systems are not designed to reflect specific customer specifications. OSS on the other hand has continued to find efficient ways service this market profitably.  For example, OSS designs and builds a custom server with custom connectors and 16 high definition video media outputs that are used in the entertainment industry to provide multimedia at a live performance. 
 These servers can be accelerated or not, but they are built generally to the latest release of PCIe. For HPC applications, these servers can be designed to support GPUs, either within the server itself or via PCIe-over-cable to an external GPU compute accelerator chassis designed and manufactured by OSS. 
 We believe the custom server segment is growing much faster than the standard server segment, which has contributed greatly to the growth of OSS. Intersect360 Research estimates that the market for HPC servers is expected to be approximately $14.4 billion by 2021, with the market share for HPC servers to be as follows: 
 
 
Hewlett Packard | 33.0 | %
----------------+------+--
Dell | 26.4 | %
Lenovo | 6.9 | %
IBM | 6.8 | %
Cray | 4.5 | %
ATOS/Bull | 2.6 | %
Inspur | 2.0 | %
Fujitsu | 1.8 | %
Penguin | 1.5 | %
Huawei | 1.2 | %
Others | 13.5 | %

 
It is our experience that OSS is increasingly competitive in the “Others” category, where customers require their systems to meet specific operational specifications, power requirements, speed, latency, or other requirements not covered by traditional designs. We estimate that our addressable market for HPC computers is approximately 20% of the “Others” category in the above chart. This translates to an addressable market size of approximately $389 million with our current engineering capability and product set. Our strategy is to stay laser focused and be the best in this market segment. We plan to use some of the capital raised in our initial public offering to accelerate our growth to capitalize on this market segment.

GPU Compute Accelerators 
 GPU computing uses hardware chips that are optimized to perform mathematical calculations in a rapid fashion. NVIDIA is the market leader in the design and manufacturing of these components. NVIDA has done extremely well in recent years as this part of the computing market is growing much faster by new applications compared to the traditional CPUs from companies like Intel.  OSS works closely with NVIDIA to design and build systems which use multiple GPUs to accelerate the applications being run by the computer. 
 The unique design of the GPU provides thousands of processing “cores” which act as individual coprocessors to speed up the calculations on large data sets. It is generally believed that traditional processor designs, which have been driven by “Moore’s Law,” are reaching the limits of what is physically possible in speed and throughput. GPU acceleration is driving many of the newest and fastest growing technology opportunities in this new age of computing. This is a relatively new phenomenon. Indeed, many of the applications that are gaining notoriety today have only become possible because of the ability of GPUs to optimize computational throughput, perform many tasks at once, and make sense of the massive amounts of data that is available to high performance algorithms. 
 Markets such as image rendering and processing, self-driving cars, deep learning, molecular modeling and genomics, advanced visualization, machine learning, and image processing, all benefit from the ability to use GPUs to accelerate the application. OSS builds compute accelerators, using the latest GPU technology, to attach to traditional servers used in these emerging growth markets. Because of the relative newness of these markets, little market data exists to precisely define these markets, but we estimate these markets to be very large and growing. While we are beginning from a small base, we expect these markets to be valued in the billions of dollars in the near future. Because our strategy has been to be first-to-market with the fastest and densest compute accelerator appliances, we anticipate our addressable market here to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 We also have a strong position in the government market which, according to Intersect360, constitutes 26% of the market that is growing to $43.9 billion by 2021. An emerging market, slightly different from traditional HPC markets, is the hyperscale market, which is a scalable, web-facing application infrastructure that is distinct from traditional IT infrastructure. OSS products can form a basis for companies who wish to participate in the hyperscale market, which includes deep learning and AI. This is a major technology trend that OSS is addressing through its product roadmap and investment in SkyScale, a company that provides HPC infrastructure as a service through a cloud-based interface. Intersect360 estimates the deep learning market was worth more than $2.0 billion in 2016, with nearly 100% growth projected from 2017 to 2018. 
 All Flash Arrays 
 We build flash storage arrays to customer specifications utilizing our unique know-how in packaging, cooling, and PCIe-over-cable. We deliver dense, high-performance systems that provide customers with extreme value and utility in the most demanding, data-intensive operations. 
 Through a strategic agreement with Western Digital, we have acquired a source code license to utilize their proprietary Ion flash array software, which provides OSS flash arrays with a high level of differentiation around management, latency and throughput. Although we maintain an offering of standard flash array products, our expertise and success has been in providing arrays with specialized packaging for demanding applications that are not suitable for standard offerings. 
 For example, we provide products to a large military/government contractor for integration into a military aircraft that required us to rethink packaging and data portability. This resulted in the development of a product that provides extreme data density with low weight, and a high degree of portability and security for the data. We developed this product, from concept to design and prototype, within a very short period and with outstanding results. We believe our experience and capability in high speed, low-latency, digital signaling via PCIe gives us an edge in providing these custom designs to OEMs, integrators, and other special purpose applications. 
 The overall market for flash arrays is growing rapidly. According to the Dell’Oro Group, the flash storage market totaled more than $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2017, up 48% compared to the same year-ago quarter, and is expected to grow 40% in 2017. About 86% of the total in the first quarter was attributed to traditional large OEMs, like Dell EMC, NetApp, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Pure Storage and IBM. The remaining 14%, or total revenue of about $182 million in the first quarter of 2017, is addressed by many smaller flash storage providers, including OSS. We believe that because our products are positively differentiated by speed, density, and management features, our offerings compete favorably in this market and provide a substantial growth opportunity. 
 9

OSS participates in the broader market for dense, fast flash storage systems that may or may not be deployed into HPC environments. Since we develop custom flash storage arrays, we work closely with both OEMs and end users to insure they receive the product they want in the specific configuration, size and weight required for their application. We believe this gives OSS an advantageous position in a market that is growing rapidly and allows us to favorably compete in the market. We also believe our unique approach to building arrays and appliances based on leading-edge technology is one of the key factors driving our growth. 
 PCIe Expansion and Adaptors 
 PCIe (PCI Express) is a high-speed computer expansion standard. This standard defines the signals and connectors (i.e. slots) that are used for computer add-in cards (such as Ethernet or graphics). PCIe signaling can also be routed over a cable, allowing expansion input/output slots to be physically located in a separate chassis. This provides for the highest performance and lowest latency which is essential in this market.
 Being able to route PCIe over a cable facilitates disaggregation of server functionality. That is, with PCIe, certain server functions no longer needed to be contained in the physical server chassis, but could instead be separated and continue to operate at full speed. From a practical perspective, servers could now be connected directly to larger storage arrays or other peripheral devices, with the resulting group of chassis operating as if they were all in the same physical chassis. 
 We began developing our first PCIe-over-cable adaptor in 2006, and were one of the early providers of PCIe adaptors. We recognized this as prime opportunity to utilize our core strengths, such as: 
  
• | High-speed board design and layout
--+-----------------------------------


• | Hardware tuning to improve signal integrity
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Design optimization for low cost
--+---------------------------------


• | Rapid design capability
--+------------------------


• | Manufacturing and supply chain management
--+------------------------------------------

 This technology has now become a standard within the computer industry, and OSS customers have used our adaptors to connect their custom input/output chassis and achieve performance equivalence as if the input/output was integrated into the server box. This gives designers and integrators a degree of flexibility and utility in architecting computer systems that is unprecedented. For example, one of our customers has utilized PCIe-over-cable to connect its high performance video editing systems to a host computer, providing a system that is optimized for an application using standard servers. We have expanded our PCIe adaptor market in breadth and depth, including making adaptors for many OEM customers. To date, we have shipped more than 100,000 PCIe adaptor cards to customers globally. 
 With our expertise developed in designing adaptor cards, the logical extension of our capability led us to develop a method for expanding the PCIe bus into an external chassis containing one or many expansion slots. This allowed a customer to install multiple standard PCIe boards into a chassis and expand their system without having to add additional servers. A user could now connect a multiplicity of PCIe devices to a single server, and achieve performance and throughput that was not possible prior to the introduction of PCIe. 
 We have been a leader in PCIe expansion backplanes and chassis through generations 1, 2 and 3. As PCIe evolves through generations 4 and 5, we are uniquely positioned to continue our leadership role in this market. We currently offer what we believe to be the largest PCIe expansion product line breadth, with chassis and backplanes that offer expansion from one to 64 slots. Due to its greater data throughput and flexibility of design, we believe this is a growing market, and we intend to maintain our leadership role.

Cloud Services (IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service) 
 One of the fastest growing areas of the HPC market is providing HPC services in the cloud. The cloud HPC market is estimated to grow to $10.8 billion by 2020 at an estimated compound annual growth rate of 19.9%, according to market research published by MarketsandMarkets. Cloud HPC makes it possible for enterprises to achieve rapid scalability for mission critical applications. Such services are fast and easy to deploy, and require less capital and operating overhead, which enables enterprises to focus on their core business activities. 
 We are ideally suited to participate in this market opportunity given our position in GPU acceleration and high-speed storage technology. In May 2017, we announced a partnership with SkyScale, LLC, a High-Performance Computing-as-a-Service (HPCaaS) provider to offer customers world-class, ultra-fast, multi-GPU hardware platforms in the cloud. This joint venture allows the leasing of state-of-the-art high-performance computing hardware at rates which provide a compelling value proposition to customers who want the fastest performance available, but are not interested in running their own HPC datacenter or committing to the significant capital investment. SkyScale provides this infrastructure, including common HPC applications, at a fraction of the cost of the full-time system. 
 SkyScale utilizes our equipment and hosts it in a state of the art, ultra-secure and highly reliable datacenter in San Diego. Through SkyScale, customers get access to their own infrastructure in the cloud which is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This is our first foray into the growing “Infrastructure as a Service” (IaaS) market, and is expected to become a cornerstone of growth for OSS. It also provides our sales teams with the ability to provide ‘try-to-buy’ programs, where customers considering purchase of on premise equipment can first test their compute environment via the SkyScale cloud infrastructure. 
 SkyScale addresses three classes of customers: First, it provides dedicated HPC GPU compute nodes to end-user customers on a weekly or monthly rental basis. These customers are typically either developers in deep learning and AI, or engineering teams doing complex simulation tasks in vertical industries, like automotive, aerospace, or oil and gas. Second, SkyScale provides the backend hardware cloud infrastructure that can be utilized by specialized cloud service providers that have a front-end customer portal. In this instance, SkyScale’s infrastructure is private-labeled by the front-end service provider and often as a HPC line extension of the AWS (Amazon Web Services) or Microsoft Azure hosted service. Lastly, SkyScale provides virtual private clouds for enterprises that want HPC hardware in the cloud, but also want a dedicated resource rather than using a public service like AWS. 
 SkyScale cloud offerings are based on today’s latest NVIDIA high end GPU called Pascal (P100). In keeping with our first-to-market strategy, SkyScale will be the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA’s next generation GPU called Volta (V100) later this year. 
 Our Cloud Services business is still in its early stages. To date, we have not generated substantial revenues from this line of business. 
 Our Technology 
 We design and manufacture high performance computing systems that revolutionize the data center by increasing compute performance while reducing cost and impact to the infrastructure. Our high-density compute accelerators connect directly to a server’s PCIe bus, delivering substantial compute performance. Our flash storage arrays support hundreds of terabytes of high-speed storage that can also be accessed by multiple servers. 
 Technology Drivers for OSS HPC Business 
 OSS has developed expertise and core competencies in the three fundamental technology drivers of today’s HPC market. Namely, high-speed serial interconnect technology, massively parallel computing utilizing GPUs, and low latency flash storage. In combination, these technologies are fundamentally changing the economics of computing, bringing HPC within the grasp of a wide range of new industries and commercial applications. Simultaneously the explosion of massive data being generated in each of these industries is pushing the requirement for state-of-the-art HPC technology, AI, and machine learning to transform this data economically and efficiently to useful and actionable information. 
 11

The opportunity is not only to provide competitive advantage for corporations, but also address some of the most fundamental challenges in life science, energy and security facing the world today. OSS is ideally situated to leverage these major industry forces. By exploiting its unique set of expertise in the underpinning technologies of HPC, OSS will continue to deliver world leading HPC solutions, with the opportunity to capture a growing market share of this rapidly expanding marketplace. 
 Switched Serial Interconnect 
 Switched serial interconnects are the data highways connecting all elements of today’s high-performance computing platforms. At ever increasing speeds, these pathways move data between system’s processing units, storage, networking, and peripheral elements. Bottlenecks in these data highways negatively impact the overall performance of the applications running on the system. Today for high performance computing the primary processing, direct attached storage and peripheral interconnect is PCIe Gen 3. PCIe Gen 3 has an ability to run up to 16 lanes in parallel, which allows up to 16 gigabytes per second theoretical bandwidth between system elements. 
 Serial switches incorporated in system design allow many system elements to be connected together in a non-blocking interconnect fabric at PCIe Gen 3 speeds. This allows systems to scale internally avoiding bottlenecks. The serial interconnect can be embedded directly in the computer printed circuit boards, across connectors board-to-board, or traverse across copper or optical cables for chassis-to-chassis connection. Due to the extremely high speeds, the design considerations around signal integrity are rigorous and with unforgiving tolerances. PCIe Gen 4 will begin deployment in early 2018, doubling the interconnect speed, and PCIe Gen 5 is expected early in the next decade. 
 Serial interconnects are also used to interconnect nodes into larger scale networks and clusters. In this case, the primary interconnects are Infiniband and Ethernet. These technologies have the advantage of scaling to very high numbers of network elements over potentially large distances. The tradeoff over PCIe is higher latency (transit time across the interconnect) and protocol complexity requiring processing cycles to manage. Many HPC deployments incorporate these interconnect technologies in order to deliver large scale solutions with optimized technology selections for each system aspect. In summary, PCIe is used at the local level for the ultimate performance/low latency and these other interconnects are used to expand the network.
 GP-GPUs: Computational GPUs. 
 Over the last several years, GPUs have evolved from graphics display acceleration to becoming general-purpose processing workhorse of HPC systems. Today, the majority of the fastest supercomputers in the world utilize GPUs as their primary compute engines. GPUs are ideal for HPC workloads because of their ability to do massively parallel processing. While traditional CPUs today may have dozens of processing cores, GPUs have thousands of cores that are all able to execute calculations simultaneously. 
 For many HPC applications, fundamental pieces of the code can be optimized to run in parallel and therefore experience significant performance enhancements. NVIDIA, a key supplier of GPUs to the market, has done extensive benchmarking showing the ability of single GPU based machines to exceed the performance of dozens or even thousands of traditional CPU only computers. NVIDIA has worked extensively with the software development community, and hundreds of HPC applications have been tuned and developed to run on GPUs. 
 The current NVIDIA GPU Applications catalog lists more than 400 such applications across a broad set of market spaces including: 
  
• | Computational Finance
--+----------------------


• | Climate, Weather and Ocean Modeling
--+------------------------------------


• | Computational Chemistry and Biology
--+------------------------------------


• | Data Science and Analytics

• | Oil and Gas
--+------------


• | Safety and Security
--+--------------------

 Many of these applications also scale performance based on the number of GPUs utilized. OSS has designed multi-GPU systems including up to 16 GPUs in a single system. Current state-of-the art GP-GPUs includes Pascal 100 from NVIDIA, providing up to 4.7 teraflops of double precision performance, including 3,584 cores and up to 16 gigabytes of memory. NVIDIA’s next generation GPU, Volta, increases performance to 7.5 teraflops double precision, and includes extensive optimizations for AI algorithms. 
 Although GPUs provide tremendous application performance advantages, they pose significant system design challenges due to their power requirements. Today’s high-end GPUs can require up to 300 watts of power, which generates a tremendous amount of heat. Sophisticated power distribution and cooling designs are required, especially for large scale systems with multi-GPUs per chassis. 
 PCI Express Flash Storage 
 The use of flash memory technology for system storage has gained traction over the last several years, as the cost per gigabyte has continued to drop. Initially relegated to the ‘hot data’ tier in a layered storage architecture, flash memory is now becoming the ubiquitous storage technology in HPC systems across all performance and capacity tiers. 
 Combined with the move away from traditional rotating hard drive technology has been the trend toward eliminating traditional storage protocols in favor of low latency flash memory protocols. SSD drives using solid state memory connect directly to the system’s PCIe interconnect. This direct connection allows for very high bandwidth between the storage and the other system elements, and eliminates the need for protocol translation as data is moved from storage subsystems to and from the compute complex. 
 Today, SSD drives with capacities up to 8 terabytes and PCIe Gen 3 interfaces are available. OSS flash storage arrays with hundreds of terabytes of capacity are available, enabling the scaling of high-speed storage to meet the full range of HPC application requirements. 
 Core Technical Capabilities 
 For nearly 20 years, OSS has developed unique expertise and core competency across the fundamental technologies of today’s rapidly expanding HPC marketplace. These valuable assets are embedded in the leading-edge engineering capabilities of our engineers, the proprietary intellectual property residing in our vast library of designs, and our brand equity based on our reputation as a high-quality producer of state-of-the-art custom and standard solutions across a broad array of markets.

High Speed System Interconnect Design 
 Our electrical engineers are experts in high speed digital signaling design. They have continually designed at the leading edge of the state-of-the-art signaling speeds, as semiconductor technology has driven up the clock rate of digital transmission. We have consistently been among a small handful of companies able to come to market first with the latest technology. In fact, we delivered the industry’s first PCIe link solutions for PCIe Gen 1, Gen 2 and Gen 3 and are currently on track to accomplish this again in Gen 4. The expertise required includes circuit design, PCB (printed circuit board) layout and routing optimizations all with a focus on achieving the highest levels of signal integrity. In our current systems, PCIe Gen 3 signals are propagated across multiple PCBs, connectors, and copper cabling while maintaining the ability to recognize digital signal transitions at 8 billion times per second. 
 In HPC systems the trajectory of ever increasing signaling speeds will not abate with next generations of PCIe, and nvlink pushing to 16 and 20 gigahertz (billions of transitions per second). An ever-shrinking set of companies have the capability to design robust, highly-reliable systems at these speeds. We believe our core competency in large-scale, high-speed design and layout will allow us to remain on the forefront of this growing industry. 
 Complex System Design 
 In addition to low-level signal integrity design expertise, we have amassed expertise and intellectual property in HPC system architecture design. This expertise allows us to develop extremely sophisticated systems with massive scaling, while meeting customer demands for reliability, cost, and flexibility. OSS HPC platforms integrate with server platforms from all major server OEMs, including Dell, HP, IBM, Oracle, and Cisco. 
 Often elements of the vendor’s servers need to be adapted to meet the scale required by HPC customers. We have developed the deep knowledge for basic input/output systems and operating system adjustments and configuration tuning required. Often, design enhancements are required for each successive generation of CPU technology. Our engineers are often called upon to consult with OEM designers to tune and enhance their systems. 
 For highly scalable systems, a deep understanding and experience with switching topologies and interconnect fabric design is required. We have worked with serial switching technology starting with the first generation of PCIe and have been an innovator in creating unique and flexible topologies to meet the specific needs of the customers. Creating custom solutions for unique customer solutions is a core competency and relies on this deep knowledge of switch capabilities and limitations. 
 For maximum system performance, design for optimizing data transfer speeds is also an important consideration. OSS has developed expertise in system design to leverage peer to peer data flows between GPUs and pioneering techniques for optimized data flows between SSD Storage and GPU compute engines. Our systems optimize switch and GPU configuration topologies to optimize GPU to GPU communication without requiring latency-inducing data transfer between host dual processors. Our platforms feature RDMA (remote direct memory access) across compute nodes, which support data transfer without burdening the host CPU. 
 We continue to be a leader in developing unique solutions leveraging PCIe. These system level design capabilities are uniquely part of our core engineering capabilities, and allow us to respond to specific customer custom requirements with high value, differentiated solutions. 
 OSS has pioneered the ability to extend the PCIe bus beyond the confines of a single enclosure, opening the possibility of flexible system expansion options. We believe we are one of the leading designers and suppliers of PCIe host bus adapters that extend PCIe signals from the host motherboard across copper or optical cables to expansion enclosures. OSS adapters provide both ends of the external cable connection. Our expertise in high-speed signal design in printed circuit boards, connectors and cables is essential to successful expansion designs. We also hold expertise in incorporating clustering and rack scale expansion into our system designs, including up to 100 gigabit Ethernet, 100 gigabit+ Infiniband, and emerging PCIe top-of-rack switch technology. 
 14

Expertise in power, cooling and mechanical design are required to address the requirements of the HPC customers. We have developed leadership design capability in high-power design and distribution within large rack enclosures. High-end GPUs today require 300 watts or above, and in our high-end systems up to 16 of these can reside in a single chassis. Thousands of kilowatts of redundant power is required. Power stability and huge thermal loads are some of the critical design issues that must be addressed. 
 We have expertise in power distribution, redundant power and complex chassis cooling design, including materials selection, airflow simulation, fan technology, liquid cooling, and cable routing. We have also developed extensive intellectual property in regulatory compliance of complex HPC system design across emission, shock, vibration, thermal, humidity and other environmental requirements that are required for highly reliable and highly available solutions. OSS engineers are experts in design for regulatory testing for FCC (Federal Communications Commission), CE (European Conformity), UL (Underwriters Laboratories), and Mil-Spec (Military Standard). Additionally, we have expertise in rapid prototyping, design for manufacturability, and design for serviceability. 
 Storage Management Software 
 Given our hardware design and integration expertise, we see the next natural step is to add a robust software capability that will allow us to offer more optimized and customized systems. By licensing source code for the Ion software and hiring the members of the software design team from Western Digital, we now have the in-house expertise to deliver full server and storage solutions that produce the highest performance from today’s leading-edge flash storage, GPUs and processors. 
 The Ion software allows flash-based cards and drives to be put into a variety of storage and network configurations, which can then be accessed by multiple servers. The Ion software can do this cost-effectively, while preserving the low latency that is vital for many business and mission-critical enterprise applications, from database and transaction processing to massive data collection programs. Ion also has a full high-availability option to ensure complete data integrity. 
 In-house mature and established foundational storage software allows OSS to add new products and capabilities to its product portfolio. Possibilities range from increasing data efficiency with de-duplication and compression, to improving system manageability and adding software-defined storage to our server products. 
 Given the recent closing of the Ion transaction, we have yet to generate substantial revenues from this line of business.

 Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing efforts our focused on promoting sales and brand awareness. 
 Sales 
 Our sales efforts entail three main areas: 
  
• | End-user Sales – OSS maintains a web site and direct sales team that sell directly to end-users. This includes e-commerce sales via typical web store functionality, and direct calling of end-user customers to provide unique solutions that fits their needs. The OSS direct sales team typically works in the OSS booth at tradeshows, directly interacting with potential customers and presenting solutions for their HPC needs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | OEM Sales – Our direct sales team also works to identify and develop potential OEM customers. This is the largest and fastest growing part of our business. For typical OEM customers, we design and build customer specified systems that are branded with the OEMs name and label. These companies then resell the products through their own channels. We actively seek this type of relationship, which is leveraged as a sales multiplier, allowing us to grow sales at a faster rate without adding more dedicated sales resources.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Channels – We have a dedicated sales resource that manages our worldwide network of resellers and distributors. We typically sell standard products through these channels, which allow us to achieve global customer touch without requiring a physical presence in all geographies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As we grow, it is anticipated our marketing efforts will likewise continue to increase in size and diversity. 
 17

Competition 
 In many cases, our primary competition is actually our potential customer. Our operational model lends itself to understanding technical and physical specifications, completing a rapid design based on our library of over 600 previous designs and prototypes, building a rapid prototype for customer approval, and an efficient design-to-manufacturing process. 
 Most of our OEM customers have sophisticated design capabilities in-house. They come to OSS for our particular expertise and experience, which allows us to work collaboratively with the customer to produce more advanced systems in a shorter timeframe. In most cases, the primary alternative to engaging OSS is for the customer to design the products themselves. We win when our customers realize that together we can produce better products faster and more cost-effectively than they can themselves. This has proven to be particularly evident when customers require state-of-the-art products that are constructed of parts available commercially. This has resulted in several design wins that demonstrate our flexibility and how we can work closely with large OEM and government customers. 
 We also compete with established competitors, third party competitive products and new entrants into the markets we serve. Established competitors include IBM, Lenovo, HP and Dell. Each offers a broad range of standard products and services for this market. In many cases, these companies are able to meet their customer needs thought their standard product offerings. In other cases, these companies work with us to help extend their product capabilities to meet customer-specific requirements. 
 Third party competitive products include cases where the manufacturers of the underlying chip or board-level products decide to also offer system-level products. This is the case with Intel, NVIDIA, Western Digital and others. These offerings tend to be tactical, short-term products that are intended to demonstrate a new technology, rather than long-term forays into the systems business. In addition these “technology demonstration systems” tend to be priced at high levels, making them less competitive once the newness factor wears off. 
 New market entrants continue to move into the rapidly evolving HPC space. Some, such as Pure Storage, Next IO and Violin Memory, raise tremendous amounts of capital and endure huge loses in an attempt to establish market share. Some of these companies come and go fairly quickly (note Next IO and Violin Memory are both out of business) as they ran out of capital to continue operations over the long term. 
 Manufacturing and Operations 
 OSS is certified under ISO 9001-2008 for “design, manufacture, and supply of industrial computers.” This means OSS has demonstrated its ability to consistently provide products that meet both customer requirements and applicable regulatory or statutory requirements. It also indicates that we have programs and processes in place to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction, as well as a continuous improvement program that ensures OSS gets better over time. 
 We utilize lean principles to drive our manufacturing and assembly process. One of the key aspects of this is our application of just-in-time principles that ensure effective ordering and utilization of inventory, and this helps optimize cash flow throughout the manufacturing cycle. Within the manufacturing process, our operations encompass three categories of “builds:” 
  
• | Standard Builds – These are builds of standard products that are sold with little or no customization or non-standard features. These are products that are ready to be installed or integrated by the customer upon receipt.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Custom Builds – Custom builds involve a product built to a customer specification. Upon receipt, the customer has a unique product that performs all the functions and has the physical dimensions that match their specifications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engineering Project Builds – OSS supports the product development process by building models and prototypes of products. Developed by the OSS engineering group, the prototypes can be of standard or custom products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18

OSS is dedicated to quality and customer satisfaction. Within the manufacturing operations function at OSS, our processes begin with the end goal in mind. This means we start with the customer. All our business processes begin with the idea that the customer is the essence of why we exist. Our continuous improvement efforts require us to review products, services, and processes with the idea that minor changes can lead to greater outcomes for our customers. 
 While we are cognizant of the additive nature of small improvements, we believe a disciplined approach to improvement sometime leads to extraordinary, large, and positive advances in our products and services. This is extremely important to OSS, as our goal is to bring the most advanced leading-edge technologies to our customers before our competitors can. Our operations strategy supports our overall mission of being first to market with customized, leading-edge products that are best-in-market in terms of speed and overall performance. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development at OSS is centered on the exploitation of key technologies as they evolve in the marketplace. Our product roadmap reflects new component technologies for CPUs, GPUs, flash storage, and advanced PCIe switches. We design first-to-market, custom implementations utilizing these component technologies. Accordingly, our focus lies not in the capital-intensive development of silicon implementations of technologies (i.e., chips, processors, GPUs, or storage devices), but rather in taking leading-edge technologies and building first-to-market products that fully exploit those technologies for solving customer problems. 
 The OSS research and development strategy can be summarized as follows: OSS drives design wins by utilizing key new technologies to develop products that are leading edge and first to market.
Some examples of OSS developments: 
  
• | GPU compute accelerators with the most GPUs per rack unit.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Networking of GPUs.
--+--------------------


• | Broad range of solutions, due to specific customer design.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Capability to expand existing servers from virtually any OEM.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | First-to-market products as new GPUs are introduced by NVIDIA, Intel, Western Digital and Broadcom.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Complete customization per the needs of our OEM customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Integration of multiple new technologies (servers, GPUs, flash drives, and PCIe) into an optimized product for our OEM customers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property 
 The primary intellectual property basis of OSS emanates from the more than 600 individual design projects we have undertaken over the decades since our founding. These designs are archived and cataloged, so we rarely begin a new design from scratch. 
 Over the years, our team has developed and maintained expertise in high-speed signal design and analysis, electronic and mechanical packaging, PCIe-over-cable, fiber optics transmission, high-speed/density flash arrays, and integration and deployment of GPUs in compute accelerators and servers. This extensive expertise positions us to expand and rationalize our product line to meet the growing and ever-changing HPC market.

Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 75 employees including several contracted personnel. Our employees are typically highly skilled as engineers, technicians, assemblers, and support staff. They are housed in four facilities, and are led by a management team that is supportive and helpful. We have experienced very little turnover of personnel in the past and endeavor to provide an environment that allows meaningful employee input to all functional areas of the Company. The management team provides transparency to its employees through monthly communication meetings designed to update all employees on current results and future expectations. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be strong. 
Facilities 
 Our corporate headquarters are in a leased space comprising approximately 17,911 square feet in Escondido, California under a lease that expires in August 2018. We occupy another facility in San Diego with approximately 13,588 square feet, which also expires in August 2018. SkyScale operates out of our San Diego facility and also leases data center space at a local data center. We also lease a small space near Munich, Germany for our German subsidiary, OSS GmbH and a 3,208 square foot facility in Salt Lake City, Utah that houses our Ion software development team. We are in the process of determining whether we want to extend our leases at the Escondido and San Diego locations or consolidate into a single, larger facility. We periodically review our lease arrangements at our Germany and Utah locations to determine whether they suit our needs.
