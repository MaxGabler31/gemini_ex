ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Company Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company that currently supports the clinical stage development of a telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, in hematologic myeloid malignancies, by Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen. Early clinical data in essential thrombocythemia, or ET, myelofibrosis, or MF, and myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, suggest imetelstat may have disease‑modifying activity by inhibiting the progenitor cells of the malignant clones for the underlying diseases.
 On November 13, 2014, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Janssen the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize imetelstat worldwide for all indications in oncology, including hematologic myeloid malignancies, and all other human therapeutic uses. The Collaboration Agreement became effective on December 15, 2014, and we received $35 million from Janssen as an upfront payment. Additional consideration under the Collaboration Agreement includes potential payments of up to an aggregate maximum total of $900 million for the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalties on worldwide net sales of imetelstat. The Collaboration Agreement also provides for a joint governance structure that includes a Joint Steering Committee, or JSC, with equal membership from both companies. See “Licensing—Collaboration and License Agreement with Janssen” below, for more information about the Collaboration Agreement, including economic terms and termination provisions of the Collaboration Agreement. The

information provided should be reviewed in the context of the sections entitled “Risks Related to Our Collaboration with Janssen” and “Risks Related to Clinical Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization of Imetelstat” under Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. 
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is wholly responsible for developing, manufacturing, seeking regulatory approval for, and commercialization of, imetelstat worldwide. Janssen is currently conducting two clinical trials of imetelstat: IMbark, a Phase 2 trial in MF, in which the first patient was dosed in September 2015 and the last patient was enrolled in October 2016; and IMerge, a Phase 2/3 trial in MDS, in which the first patient was dosed in January 2016. We contribute 50% of the development costs for these trials, which Janssen is solely conducting.
 For IMbark, Janssen completed internal data reviews in September 2016, April 2017 and March 2018. In these data reviews, activity within multiple outcome measures was observed with imetelstat treatment that suggest potential clinical benefit in patients with MF who are relapsed after or refractory to prior treatment with a janus kinase, or JAK, inhibitor. However, new patient enrollment in IMbark was suspended in October 2016 because an insufficient numb
er of patients met the protocol defined interim efficacy criteria to continue enrollment. In March 2018, Janssen will officially close the trial to new patient enrollment. The JSC expects that the over 100 patients enrolled in IMbark to date will be adequate to assess overall survival. Patients who remain in the treatment phase of IMbark may continue to receive imetelstat, and until the protocol-specified primary analysis, all safety and efficacy assessments are being conducted as planned in the protocol, including following patients, to the extent possible, until death, to enable an assessment of overall survival. In March 2018, based on the rate of deaths occurring in the trial, the JSC determined that the protocol-specified primary analysis of IMbark, which includes an assessment of overall survival, will begin by the end of the second quarter of 2018. Upon the protocol-specified primary analysis, the main trial will be completed. The IMbark protocol is being amended to establish an extension phase of the trial to enable patients remaining in the treatment phase to continue to receive imetelstat treatment, per investigator discretion. Following completion of the primary analysis, Janssen must notify us of its decision, or the Continuation Decision, whether 
to: (i) maintain the license rights granted under the Collaboration Agreement and continue the development of imetelstat or (ii) discontinue the development of imetelstat and terminate the Collaboration Agreement. We expect Janssen to inform us of its decision by the end of the third quarter of 2018. 
 For IMerge, Janssen completed internal data reviews in September 2016 and April 2017. In addition, preliminary data from Part 1 of IMerge were presented at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, or ASH, in December 2017. These data showed that among the 32 red blood cell transfusion-dependent MDS patients enrolled in Part 1of the trial, a subset of 13 patients who had not received prior treatment with either a hypomethylating agent or lenalidomide and did not have a deletion 5q chromosomal abnormality, or non-del(5q), exhibited an increased rate and durability of transfusion independence compared to the overall trial population. Based on the preliminary data from this 13-patient subset, Janssen has expanded new patient enrollment in Part 1 of IMerge to enroll approximately 20 additional patients to increase the experience and confirm the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat in this refined target patient population. In November 2017, the first patient was dosed in the expanded Part 1 and enrollment was completed in February 2018. Using the preliminary data from Part 1, Janssen sponsored an application to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for Fast Track designation for the potential treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low or Intermediate-1 risk MDS who are non-del(5q) and who are refractory or resistant to treatment with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent. The FDA granted Fast Track designation to imetelstat in October 2017.
 We had approximately $109.2 million in cash and investments as of December 31, 2017. To grow and diversify our business, we plan to continue our business development efforts to identify, and seek to acquire and/or in‑license other oncology product candidates, programs or companies. Acquisition or in‑licensing opportunities that we may pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness or seek equity capital, or both.
 Telomerase: Scientific Rationale
 Telomeres and Telomerase in Normal Development
 In the human body, normal growth and maintenance of tissues occurs by cell division. However, most cells are only able to divide a limited number of times, and this number of divisions is regulated by telomere length. Telomeres are repetitions of a deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, sequence located at the ends of chromosomes. They act as protective caps to maintain stability and integrity of the chromosomes, which contain the cell’s genetic material. 
 4


Normally, every time a cell divides, the telomeres shorten. Eventually, they shrink to a critically short length, and as a result, the cell either dies by apoptosis or stops dividing and senesces.
 Telomerase is a naturally occurring enzyme that maintains telomeres and prevents them from shortening during cell division in cells, such as stem cells that must remain immortalized to support normal health. Telomerase consists of at least two essential components: a ribonucleic acid, or RNA, template (hTR), which binds to the telomere, and a catalytic subunit (hTERT) with reverse transcriptase activity, which adds a specific DNA sequence to the chromosome ends. The 2009 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Drs. Elizabeth H. Blackburn, Carol W. Greider and Jack Szostak, former Geron collaborators, for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by both telomeres and telomerase.
 Telomerase is active during embryonic development, enabling the rapid cell division that supports normal growth. During the latter stages of human fetal development and in adulthood, telomerase is repressed in most cells, and telomere length gradually decreases during a lifetime. In tissues that have a high turnover throughout life, such as blood and gut, telomerase can be transiently upregulated in progenitor cells to enable controlled, self‑limited proliferation to replace cells lost through natural cell aging processes. As the progeny of progenitor cells mature, telomerase is downregulated and telomeres shorten with cell division, preventing uncontrolled proliferation.
 Telomeres and Telomerase in Cancer
 Telomerase is upregulated in many tumor progenitor cells, enabling the continued and uncontrolled proliferation of the malignant cells that drive tumor growth and progression. Telomerase expression has been found to be present in approximately 90% of biopsies taken from a broad range of human cancers. Our nonclinical studies, in which the telomerase gene was artificially introduced and expressed in normal cells grown in culture, have suggested that telomerase does not itself cause a normal cell to become malignant. Instead, the sustained upregulation of telomerase enables tumor cells to maintain telomere length, providing them with the capacity for limitless proliferation. We believe that the sustained upregulation of telomerase is critical for tumor progression as it enables malignant progenitor cells to acquire cellular immortality and avoid apoptosis, or cell death.
 Telomerase Inhibition: Inducing Cancer Cell Death
 We believe that inhibiting telomerase may be an attractive approach to treating cancer because it may limit the proliferative capacity of malignant cells. We and others have observed in various in vitro and rodent tumor models that inhibiting telomerase results in telomere shortening and arrests uncontrolled malignant cell proliferation and tumor growth. In vitro studies have suggested that tumor cells with short telomeres may be especially sensitive to the anti‑proliferative effects of inhibiting telomerase. Our nonclinical data also suggest that inhibiting telomerase is particularly effective at limiting the proliferation of malignant progenitor cells, which have high levels of telomerase and are believed to be important drivers of tumor growth and progression.
Imetelstat: The First Telomerase Inhibitor to Advance to Clinical Development
 Imetelstat is a lipid conjugated 13‑mer oligonucleotide that we designed to be complementary to and bind with high affinity to the RNA template of telomerase, thereby directly inhibiting telomerase activity. Imetelstat does not elicit its effect through an antisense inhibition of protein translation. The compound has a proprietary thio‑phosphoramidate backbone, which is designed to provide resistance to the effect of cellular nucleases, thus conferring improved stability in plasma and tissues, as well as improved binding affinity to its target. To improve the ability of imetelstat to penetrate cellular membranes, we conjugated the oligonucleotide to a lipid group. Imetelstat’s IC50, or half maximal inhibitory concentration, is 0.5 ‑ 10 nM in cell free assays. Single‑dose kinetics in patients has shown dose‑dependent increases in exposure to imetelstat, with a plasma half‑life, which is the time it takes for the concentration or amount of imetelstat to be reduced by half, ranging from 4 ‑ 5 hours. Data from animal studies and clinical trials have suggested that the residence time of imetelstat in bone marrow is long, with 0.19 ‑ 0.51 µM observed at 41 ‑ 45 hours after a 7.5 mg/kg dose in patients. Imetelstat also has been shown in nonclinical studies to exhibit relatively preferential inhibition of the clonal proliferation of malignant progenitor cells compared to normal progenitors. For these reasons, imetelstat has been studied as a potential treatment for malignant diseases.
 5


Imetelstat is the first telomerase inhibitor to advance to clinical development. The Phase 1 trials that we completed evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of imetelstat. We established doses and dosing schedules that were tolerable and achieved target exposures in patients that were consistent with those required for efficacy in animal models. Following intravenous administration of imetelstat using tolerable dosing regimens, clinically relevant and significant inhibition of telomerase activity was observed in various types of tissue in which telomerase activity is measurable, including normal bone marrow hematopoietic cells, malignant plasma cells, hair follicle cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Dose‑limiting toxicities included thrombocytopenia, or reduced platelet count, and neutropenia, or reduced neutrophil count.
 Disease Characteristics of Hematologic Malignancies
 Hematologic malignancies, or blood cancers, are classified according to the predominant location of the malignancy. A hematologic myeloid malignancy is a cancer that occurs in the precursor cells to red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells such as granulocytes. Examples include acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, MDS and the myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as ET, polycythemia vera and MF. These are different from lymphocytic malignancies which typically occur in the lymphoid lineage that includes white blood cells, such as T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. Examples of lymphoid malignancies include acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas and multiple myeloma.
 Many hematologic myeloid malignancies, such as ET, MF, and MDS, have been shown to arise from malignant progenitor cells in the bone marrow that express higher telomerase activity and have shorter telomeres when compared to normal healthy cells.
 Unmet Medical Need in Myelofibrosis
 MF, a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm, is a chronic blood cancer in which abnormal or malignant precursor cells in the bone marrow proliferate rapidly, causing scar tissue, or fibrosis, to form. As a result, normal blood production in the bone marrow is impaired and may shift to other organs such as the spleen and liver, which can cause them to enlarge substantially. People with MF may have abnormally low or high numbers of circulating red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets, and abnormally high numbers of immature cells in the blood or bone marrow. MF patients can also suffer from debilitating constitutional symptoms, such as drenching night sweats, fatigue, severe itching, or pruritus, abdominal pain, fever and bone pain. The estimated prevalence of MF in the United States, or U.S., is approximately 13,000 patients, with an annual incidence of approximately 3,000 patients. Up to 20% of patients with MF develop acute myeloid leukemia, or AML.
 Approximately 70% of MF patients are classified as having intermediate‑2 or high risk disease, as defined by the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System Plus, or DIPSS Plus, described in a 2011 Journal of Clinical Oncology article. There is currently only one targeted drug therapy, ruxolitinib, approved by the FDA and other health authorities for treating these MF patients. Currently, no drug therapy is approved for those patients who fail or no longer respond to that treatment, and median survival for such MF patients is only approximately seven to 16 months, representing a significant unmet medical need.
Unmet Medical Need in Myelodysplastic Syndromes
 MDS is a group of blood disorders in which the proliferation of malignant progenitor cell clones in the bone marrow results in disordered and ineffective production of the myeloid lineage, which includes red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. In MDS, bone marrow and peripheral blood cells may have abnormal, or dysplastic, cell morphology. MDS is frequently characterized clinically by severe anemia, or low red cell counts, and low hemoglobin. In addition, other peripheral cytopenias, or low numbers of white blood cells and platelets, may cause life‑threatening infections and bleeding. Transformation to AML occurs in up to 30% of MDS cases and results in poorer overall survival.
 6


MDS is the most common of the myeloid malignancies. There are approximately 60,000 people in the United States living with the disease and approximately 16,000 reported new cases of MDS in the United States every year. MDS is primarily a disease of the elderly, with median age at diagnosis around 70 years. The majority of patients, approximately 70%, fall into what are considered to be the lower risk groups at diagnosis, according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, or IPSS, that takes into account the presence of a number of disease factors, such as cytopenias and cytogenetics, to assign relative risk of progression to AML and overall survival.
 Chronic anemia is the predominant clinical problem in patients who have lower risk MDS. Many of these patients become dependent on red blood cell transfusions, which can lead to elevated levels of iron, which the body has no normal way to eliminate, in the blood and other tissues. Iron overload is a potentially dangerous condition. Studies in patients with MDS have shown that iron overload resulting from regular red blood cell transfusions is associated with a poorer overall survival and a higher risk of developing AML.
 Developing Imetelstat to Treat Hematologic Myeloid Malignancies
 Proof‑of‑Concept of Imetelstat’s Disease‑Modifying Potential
 We believe that imetelstat may have the potential to suppress the proliferation of malignant progenitor cell clones to allow recovery of normal hematopoiesis in patients with hematologic myeloid malignancies. Early clinical data from a Phase 2 trial of imetelstat in patients with ET, or the ET Trial, and a pilot study of imetelstat in patients with MF conducted at Mayo Clinic, or the Pilot Study, suggest imetelstat may exhibit such disease‑modifying activity. These data were published in two separate articles in a September 2015 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. 
 Reported adverse events, or AEs, and laboratory investigations associated with imetelstat in the ET Trial and the Pilot Study included cytopenias, gastrointestinal symptoms, constitutional symptoms, and hepatic biochemistry abnormalities. Dose‑limiting toxicities, such as profound and prolonged thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, and other safety issues, including death, were observed in the ET Trial and the Pilot Study. In those trials, such myelosuppression was managed by dose holds and modification rules.
 Imetelstat Clinical Trials Under the Collaboration with Janssen
 Under the Collaboration Agreement (as described below), Janssen is conducting two clinical trials of imetelstat: IMbark and IMerge.
 IMbark
 Trial Design
 IMbark was designed as a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate two starting dose levels of imetelstat (either 4.7 mg/kg or 9.4 mg/kg administered by intravenous infusion every three weeks) in approximately 200 patients with Intermediate-2 or High risk MF who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor. 
 The co-primary efficacy endpoints for the trial are spleen response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a ≥35% reduction in spleen volume assessed by imaging, and symptom response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a ≥50% reduction in Total Symptom Score, at 24 weeks. Key secondary endpoints are safety and overall survival. Other secondary efficacy endpoints include the number of patients achieving complete remission, or CR, or partial remission, or PR, clinical improvement, or CI, and anemia, spleen and symptom responses. Exploratory endpoints include cytogenetic and molecular responses, as well as leukemia‑free survival.
 The first patient in IMbark was dosed in September 2015 and the last patient was enrolled in October 2016. The trial is being conducted at multiple medical centers across North America, Europe and Asia. Trial design information for IMbark, including patient eligibility criteria, and locations of clinical sites, is posted on clinicaltrials.gov.

Preliminary Observations and Actions
 Since IMbark was initiated, Janssen has conducted internal data reviews in September 2016 and April 2017. Based on these reviews, the JSC made the following observations and implemented the following actions:

• | The safety profile was consistent with prior clinical trials of imetelstat in hematologic malignancies, and no new safety signals were identified.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The data supported 9.4 mg/kg as an appropriate starting dose in the trial. Activity within multiple outcome measures was observed with imetelstat treatment, suggesting potential clinical benefit in MF patients who are relapsed or refractory to prior JAK inhibitor treatment. A range of spleen volume reductions were reported, as well as reductions in Total Symptom Score, and improvements in hematologic parameters, such as anemia and peripheral blood counts. The spleen volume response rate observed in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm was less than that reported in clinical trials with JAK inhibitors in front-line MF patients and did not meet the interim criteria to continue enrollment of new patients. Thus, new patient enrollment was suspended in October 2016.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data from the 4.7 mg/kg arm did not warrant further investigation of that starting dose and this arm was closed to new patient enrollment following the September 2016 data review. Patients remaining in the treatment phase who were originally enrolled in the 4.7 mg/kg dosing arm are allowed to continue to receive imetelstat at that dose or, at the investigator’s discretion are permitted to receive imetelstat at an increased dose of 9.4 mg/kg.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In October 2017, Janssen submitted to the FDA data from the aforementioned internal reviews, as well as additional efficacy and safety data, including information about deaths and overall survival in IMbark, in response to an FDA information request regarding the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat in relapsed or refractory MF and justification for continued treatment of patients enrolled in the trial. Since that submission, the FDA has not requested any additional information regarding IMbark, nor has the FDA requested any changes to the trial. 
 Current Status of IMbark
 In March 2018, Janssen completed a third internal data review of IMbark, based on a January 2018 data cut, to enable a protocol amendment to allow the long-term treatment and follow up of patients, including for survival, and the JSC made the following observations and implemented the following actions:
  
• | The safety profile was consistent with prior clinical trials of imetelstat in hematologic malignancies, and no new safety signals were identified.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Outcome measures for efficacy, including spleen volume response and reductions in Total Symptom Score remain consistent with prior data reviews.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | With a median follow up of approximately 19 months, the median overall survival has not been reached in either dosing arm.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The trial is officially being closed to new patient enrollment. More than 100 patients have been enrolled in IMbark to date, which is expected to be adequate to assess overall survival. Patients who remain in the treatment phase may continue to receive imetelstat, and until the primary analysis, all safety and efficacy assessments are being conducted as planned in the protocol, including following patients, to the extent possible, until death, to enable an assessment of overall survival.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Based on the rate of deaths occurring in the trial, the JSC determined that the protocol-specified primary analysis, which includes an assessment of overall survival, will begin by the end of the second quarter of 2018.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Upon the protocol-specified primary analysis, the main trial will be completed. The IMbark protocol is being amended to establish an extension phase of the trial to enable patients remaining in the treatment phase to continue to receive imetelstat treatment per investigator discretion. During the extension phase, standard data collection will primarily consist of safety information.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continuation Decision Timing
 Following completion of the IMbark protocol-specified primary analysis, Janssen must notify us of its Continuation Decision. We expect the protocol-specified primary analysis for IMbark to begin by the end of the second quarter of 2018. As such, we expect the Continuation Decision to occur by the end of the third quarter of 2018. Janssen could discontinue the imetelstat program and terminate the Collaboration Agreement at any time, such as before the start of the IMbark primary analysis, and for any reason, irrespective of whether there is data from IMbark suggesting an adequate improvement in survival in relapsed or refractory MF or whether there is data from IMerge to support the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat in lower risk MDS. In this regard, we believe that without an adequate improvement in survival in relapsed or refractory MF, with the determination of adequacy to be assessed by Janssen in its sole discretion, Janssen would decide to discontinue the imetelstat program and terminate the Collaboration Agreement.
 IMerge
 Trial Design
 IMerge is a two-part clinical trial evaluating imetelstat in transfusion dependent patients with Low or Intermediate-1 risk, also referred to as lower risk, MDS, who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent, or ESA. To be eligible for IMerge, patients must be transfusion‑dependent, defined as requiring at least four units of packed red blood cells, or RBCs, over eight weeks before entry into the trial. Part 1 of the trial was designed as a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm trial to assess the efficacy and safety of imetelstat administered as an intravenous infusion at a starting dose of 7.5 mg/kg every four weeks in approximately 30 patients. Part 2 of the trial is planned as a Phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial in approximately 170 patients. 
 The primary efficacy endpoint is the rate of RBC transfusion-independence, or RBC TI, lasting at least 8 weeks, defined as the proportion of patients without any RBC transfusion during any consecutive 8 weeks since entry to the trial. Key secondary endpoints include the rate of RBC TI lasting at least 24 weeks and the rate of hematologic improvement-erythroid, or HI-E, defined as a rise in hemoglobin of at least 1.5 g/dL above the pretreatment level for at least 8 weeks or a reduction of at least 4 units of RBC transfusions over 8 weeks compared with the prior RBC transfusion burden. Other secondary efficacy endpoints include the time to and duration of RBC TI; the proportion of patients achieving CR or PR according to the 2006 International Working Group, or IWG, criteria for MDS; the proportion of patients requiring RBC transfusions and the transfusion burden; the proportion of patients requiring the use of myeloid growth factors and the dose; assessments of the change in the patients’ quality of life using several validated instruments; as well as an assessment of overall survival and time to progression to AML. 
 The first patient in IMerge was dosed in January 2016. The trial is being conducted at multiple medical centers across North and South America, Europe and Asia. Trial design information for IMerge, including patient eligibility criteria and locations of clinical sites, is posted on clinicaltrials.gov.
 Preliminary Data from Part 1 of IMerge
 Data, as of October 2017, from 32 patients enrolled in Part 1 of IMerge with a median follow-up of over a year were presented at the American Society for Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting and Exposition held in December 2017.
 The Part 1 patients were heavily transfusion dependent, with a median baseline RBC transfusion burden of six units over 8 weeks, ranging from four to 14 units. In the overall trial population of 32 patients, approximately one-third achieved ≥8-week RBC TI after treatment with imetelstat. Approximately 15% of the patients achieved ≥24-week RBC TI, with the median duration of transfusion independence exceeding one year and sustained rises in hemoglobin by at least 1.5g/dL from pretreatment levels for these patients. Nearly two-thirds of the patients achieved HI-E. Almost all patients experienced some reduction in transfusion burden, with the average relative transfusion burden being reduced by approximately two-thirds compared to baseline levels. These data suggest clinical benefit of imetelstat among transfusion-dependent patients with lower risk MDS.
 9


In the overall trial population, the rate of ≥8-week RBC TI did not differ based on the presence of ringed sideroblasts, indicating activity of imetelstat across different subtypes of MDS. In addition, the rate of ≥8-week RBC TI appeared to be independent of serum erythropoietin, or sEPO, levels at baseline.
 Among the 32 patients enrolled in Part 1 of IMerge, a subset of 13 patients had not received prior treatment with either a hypomethylating agent, or HMA, or lenalidomide, and did not have a deletion 5q chromosomal abnormality, or non-del(5q). This 13-patient subset showed an increased durability and rate of transfusion independence compared to the overall trial population. Approximately half of the 13-patient subset population achieved ≥8-week RBC TI after treatment with imetelstat, and almost one-third of the subset population achieved ≥24-week RBC TI.
 The safety profile in Part 1 was consistent with prior clinical trials of imetelstat in hematologic malignancies, and no new safety signals were identified. The most frequently reported adverse events were cytopenias, which were predictable, manageable and reversible, in most cases, including Grade 3 and 4, or severe, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. In addition, reported adverse events did not differ significantly between the overall trial population and the 13-patient subset.
 In October 2017, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to imetelstat for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low or Intermediate-1 risk MDS who are non-del(5q) and who are refractory or resistant to treatment with an ESA. Janssen sponsored the application for Fast Track designation, supported by preliminary data from Part 1 of IMerge.
 Current Status of IMerge
 Based on preliminary data from the 13-patient subset, Janssen has expanded Part 1 of IMerge to enroll approximately 20 additional patients who are non-del(5q) and naïve to HMA and lenalidomide treatment to increase the experience and confirm the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat in a total of approximately 30 patients in this refined target population in Part 1. The first patient in the expanded Part 1 was dosed in November 2017, and enrollment was completed in February 2018. As such, in the first quarter of 2018, no data from the expanded Part 1 of IMerge were available to be reviewed.
 Janssen has not committed to begin Part 2 of IMerge. We believe Janssen will initiate Part 2 only following an affirmative Continuation Decision, if any. Janssen could discontinue the imetelstat program and terminate the Collaboration Agreement at any time, such as, before the start of the IMbark primary analysis, and for any reason, irrespective of whether there is data from IMbark suggesting an adequate improvement in survival in relapsed or refractory MF or whether there is data from IMerge to support the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat in lower risk MDS. In this regard, we believe that without an adequate improvement in survival in relapsed or refractory MF, with the determination of adequacy to be assessed by Janssen in its sole discretion, Janssen would decide to discontinue the imetelstat program and terminate the Collaboration Agreement.
 Intellectual Property
 Intellectual property, including patent protection, is very important to our business. We file patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions, and we also rely on trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect aspects of our business. An enforceable patent with appropriate claim coverage can provide an advantage over competitors who may seek to employ similar approaches to develop therapeutics, and so the future commercial success of imetelstat in collaboration with Janssen, and therefore our future success, will be in part dependent on our intellectual property strategy. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled “Risks Related to Protecting Our Intellectual Property” under Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.
 The development of biotechnology products, including imetelstat, typically includes the early development of a technology, followed by rounds of increasingly focused innovation around a product opportunity, including identification and definition of a specific product candidate and uses thereof, manufacturing processes, product formulation and administration methods. The result of this process is that biotechnology products are often protected by several families of patent filings that are filed at different times during product development and cover different aspects of the product. Consequently, earlier filed, broad technology patents will usually expire ahead of patents covering later developments such as product formulations, so that patent expirations on a product may span several years. Patent coverage may also vary from country to country based on the scope of available patent protection. There are also opportunities to obtain an extension of patent coverage for a product in certain countries, which adds further complexity to the determination of patent life.
 10


We endeavor to monitor worldwide patent filings by third parties that are relevant to our business. Based on this monitoring, we may determine that an action is appropriate to protect our business interests. Such actions may include negotiating patent licenses where appropriate, filing oppositions against a patent, filing a request for post grant review against a patent or filing a request for the declaration of an interference with a patent application or issued patent.
 Imetelstat
 We own issued patents in the United States, Europe and other countries related to imetelstat. Composition of matter patents generally provide the most material coverage, and therefore may convey competitive advantages. Because imetelstat is still under development, subsequent innovation and associated patent filings may provide additional patent coverage with later expiration dates. Examination of overseas patent applications typically lags behind U.S. examination particularly where cases are filed first in the United States. It may be possible to obtain patent term extensions of some patents in some countries for claims covering imetelstat which could further extend the patent term.

Our patent rights relating to imetelstat include those covering composition claims to the drug molecule and related nucleic acid telomerase inhibiting molecules, as well as reagents useful in manufacturing processes for the drug, and method of treatment and kit claims, certain of which are co‑owned with other entities. Our patent rights for imetelstat and related products whose mechanism of action is telomerase inhibition have been exclusively licensed (even as to us) to Janssen for all human disorders or medical conditions. In addition, certain of our patent rights for measuring the length of telomeres in cells have been non‑exclusively licensed to Janssen.
 Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen, we remain responsible for prosecuting, at Janssen’s direction, the patents exclusively licensed to Janssen, with costs shared between us and Janssen on a 50/50 basis. For intellectual property developed under the Collaboration Agreement, the party having sole ownership interest in such intellectual property will be responsible for prosecuting any such patents, with Janssen bearing all of the patent costs for such intellectual property solely owned by Janssen and for intellectual property either jointly owned or solely owned by us such patent costs to be shared between the parties on a 50/50 basis.
 Telomerase
 Our U.S. patent rights relating to telomerase that cover technologies such as variants of the protein component of human telomerase, or hTERT, and antibodies or antigen binding fragments that specifically bind to hTERT, are co‑owned with and in‑licensed exclusively from the University of Colorado. We expect the last of these U.S. patent rights to expire in 2019. A U.S. patent for identifying inhibitors of telomerase activity is in‑licensed from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the University of California and will expire in 2019. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional information regarding our patent rights relating to telomerase.
Licensing
 Collaboration and License Agreement with Janssen
 On November 13, 2014, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Janssen the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize imetelstat worldwide for all indications in oncology, including hematologic myeloid malignancies, and all other human therapeutic uses. The Collaboration Agreement became effective on December 15, 2014, and we received $35 million from Janssen as an upfront payment. Additional consideration under the Collaboration Agreement includes potential payments of up to an aggregate maximum total of $900 million for the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalties on worldwide net sales.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is wholly responsible for developing, manufacturing, seeking regulatory approval for, and commercialization of, imetelstat worldwide. To that end, Janssen is currently conducting 
 11


two clinical trials, IMbark and IMerge. We are contributing 50% of the development costs for these clinical trials, which Janssen is solely conducting.
 Following the protocol‑specified primary analysis of IMbark by Janssen, if completed, or a certain time period after the initiation of the first Phase 3 MF study, if any, Janssen must notify us of their Continuation Decision as to whether they elect to maintain the license rights granted to them under the Collaboration Agreement and continue to advance the development of imetelstat in any indication. We expect the protocol-specified primary analysis for IMbark to begin by the end of the second quarter of 2018. As such, we expect the Continuation Decision to occur by the end of the third quarter of 2018. In the event that IMbark is terminated early, or placed on clinical hold or suspended by a regulatory authority for an extended period of time, then Janssen must instead notify us of their Continuation Decision by the date that is approximately 24 months after the initiation of IMerge. 
 In the event that Janssen notifies us of an affirmative Continuation Decision, we then would have an option, or the U.S. Opt‑In Rights, to share further U.S. development and promotion costs, including our share of development costs incurred to date by Janssen beyond IMbark or IMerge, in exchange for higher tiered royalty rates and higher future development and regulatory milestone payments if imetelstat is successfully developed and approved. If we exercise the U.S. Opt‑In Rights, then we and Janssen would share U.S. development and promotion costs beyond IMbark and IMerge on a 20/80 basis (Geron 20%, Janssen 80%), we would receive a $65 million milestone payment, or the Continuation Fee, at the time of an affirmative Continuation Decision, and would be eligible to receive additional potential payments of up to $470 million for the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, up to $350 million for the achievement of certain sales milestones, and tiered royalties ranging from a mid‑teens up to a low twenties percentage rate on worldwide net sales of imetelstat in any countries where regulatory exclusivity exists or there are valid claims under the patent rights exclusively licensed to Janssen. In addition, if we exercise the U.S. Opt‑In Rights, we then would also have a separate co‑promotion option, or the U.S. Co‑Promotion Option, to provide 20% of the U.S. selling effort with our sales force personnel, in lieu of funding 20% of U.S. promotion costs, upon regulatory approval and commercial launch of imetelstat in the United States. Such co‑promotion would be conducted under a Janssen prepared promotion plan, and in accordance with a co‑promotion agreement to be agreed by us and Janssen at the time of our exercise of the U.S. Co‑Promotion Option. We would be responsible for all costs associated with establishing and maintaining our sales force in any conduct of such co‑promotion. All product sales would be booked by Janssen. If we do not exercise the U.S. Opt‑In Rights, then all further development and promotion costs beyond IMbark or IMerge would be borne by Janssen, we would receive the $65 million Continuation Fee at the time of an affirmative Continuation Decision plus a $70 million payment for Janssen’s retention of full U.S. rights to imetelstat, and would be eligible to receive additional potential payments of up to $415 million for the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, up to $350 million for the achievement of certain sales milestones, and tiered royalties ranging from a double‑digit up to a mid‑teens percentage rate on worldwide net sales of imetelstat in any countries where regulatory exclusivity exists or there are valid claims under the patent rights exclusively licensed to Janssen.
 Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we and Janssen have created a joint governance structure, including joint development and steering committees and working groups, to oversee and manage worldwide regulatory, development and manufacturing work under the joint clinical development plan and promotional activities (assuming we exercise the U.S. Opt‑In Rights) for imetelstat, with Janssen responsible for the operational execution of those activities. In addition, both we and Janssen may propose to the joint development committee imetelstat development for any new indications not then provided for in the joint clinical development plan and if we and Janssen agree such development should be conducted outside of the joint clinical development plan, both we and Janssen would be entitled to independently undertake such development at the developing party’s own cost, subject to the other party’s obligation to provide reimbursement for its specified portion of the development costs plus a premium following marketing approval of imetelstat in such newly proposed indication as a result of such independent development. In the event that we do not exercise the U.S. Opt‑In Rights following Janssen’s affirmative Continuation Decision, the joint governance structure under the Collaboration Agreement would be dissolved, a joint oversight committee would monitor the progress of the collaboration, and we would have no further rights to conduct any independent imetelstat development.
 After an affirmative Continuation Decision by Janssen, the Collaboration Agreement would remain in effect until the expiration of the last‑to‑expire patent or the royalty obligations on sales of imetelstat cease, unless terminated earlier. If Janssen does not effect an affirmative Continuation Decision, then the Collaboration Agreement would 
 12


terminate and all rights to the imetelstat program would revert to us. Janssen may terminate the Collaboration Agreement at any time for convenience or due to a safety‑related concern. If a notice of termination from Janssen occurs, we would be entitled to certain continued operational support from Janssen and cost‑sharing under various circumstances and all rights to the imetelstat program would revert to us. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the sections entitled “Risks Related to Our Collaboration with Janssen” and “Risks Related to Clinical Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization of Imetelstat” under Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.
 Other License Agreements
 In addition to the above agreements, we have also granted licenses to a number of other organizations in the ordinary course of our business to utilize aspects of our technologies to develop and commercialize products outside of the imetelstat program. These include:

• | a license to Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Janssen Pharmaceuticals, an affiliate of Janssen, for the research, development and commercialization of products based on specialized oligonucleotide backbone chemistry and novel amidates for disorders, excluding cancers originating from the blood or bone marrow. In connection with this license, we also granted to Janssen Pharmaceuticals a non‑exclusive worldwide license under our patent rights covering the synthesis of monomers, which are the building blocks of oligonucleotides. These non‑exclusively licensed patent rights are licensed exclusively to Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement for the imetelstat program, and our license with Janssen Pharmaceuticals expressly excludes products whose predominant or primary mechanism of action is telomerase inhibition and is subject to the rights and licenses granted to Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | licenses to several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to use or commercialize telomerase immortalized cells in drug discovery research;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | licenses to several companies to sell antibodies specific to telomerase for research purposes;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | licenses to several companies to develop and commercialize reagent kits, or to provide services, for the measurement of telomere length or telomerase activity for research purposes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a license to a company to develop and commercialize a particular telomerase‑based technology for cancer detection; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a license to a company for the development of cancer immunotherapies for veterinary applications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Revenues” for a further discussion of revenues from our license agreements. We expect revenues under our license agreements related to our telomerase technology to decline significantly in the coming years, and to be eliminated by the end of 2019, due to upcoming patent expirations on such technology.
 Concentration of Revenues
 Our revenues were $1.1 million, $6.2 million and $36.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We operate in one operating segment and have operations solely in the United States. All of our long‑lived assets are maintained in the United States. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Revenues” for additional detail regarding the composition of our revenues.
Research and Development
 Our research and development costs were $11.0 million, $18.0 million and $17.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Research and Development Expenses” for additional detail regarding our research and development activities.

Manufacturing
 A typical sequence of steps in the manufacture of imetelstat drug product includes the following key components:
  
• | starting materials, which are well‑defined raw materials that are used to make bulk drug substance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | bulk drug substance, which is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a drug product that provides pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the treatment of disease; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | final drug product, which is the finished dosage form that contains the drug substance that is shipped to the clinic for patient treatment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In accordance with the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is now responsible for the manufacture and management of the supply of imetelstat on a global basis for clinical trials and, after any regulatory approval, all commercial activities. Consequently, we are, and expect to remain, dependent on Janssen to appropriately supply imetelstat and other clinical trial materials. Currently, third‑party contractors perform certain process development and other technical and scientific work with respect to imetelstat, as well as supply starting materials and manufacturing drug substance and drug product. Janssen does not have direct control over third‑party personnel or operations. These third‑party contractors, and/or any other contractors that Janssen may rely upon for the manufacture and/or supply of imetelstat, typically complete their services on a proposal by proposal basis under master supply agreements and may need to make substantial investments to enable sufficient capacity increases and cost reductions, and to implement those regulatory and compliance standards necessary for successful Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial production. These third‑party contractors, and/or any other contractors that Janssen may rely upon for the manufacture and/or supply of imetelstat, may not be able to achieve such capacity increases, cost reductions, or regulatory and compliance standards, and even if they do, such achievements may not be at a commercially reasonable cost. Janssen is responsible for establishing any long‑term commitments or commercial supply agreements with any of the third‑party contractors for imetelstat. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled “Risks Related to Manufacturing” under Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.
 Consultants
 We have consulting agreements with drug development professionals, clinicians and regulatory experts with experience in numerous fields, including oncology and drug regulations. We retain each consultant according to the terms of a consulting agreement. Under such agreements, we pay them a consulting fee and reimburse them for out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred in performing their services for us. In addition, some consultants hold options to purchase our common stock, subject to the vesting requirements contained in the consulting agreements. Our consultants may be employed by other entities and therefore may have commitments to their employer, or may have other consulting or advisory agreements that may limit their availability to us.
Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in efforts related to the biological mechanisms related to imetelstat, the study of telomeres, telomerase, or our proprietary oligonucleotide chemistry, and the research and development of therapies for the treatment of hematologic myeloid malignancies. In addition, other products and therapies that could directly compete with imetelstat currently exist or are being developed by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and by academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. We expect Janssen’s decisions regarding continued development and/or commercialization, if any, of imetelstat, including completing IMerge and/or IMbark, its Continuation Decision or the termination of the Collaboration Agreement, to be informed in part by what Janssen believes is the estimated commercial potential of imetelstat for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, such as MF or MDS.
 Many companies are developing alternative therapies to treat hematologic myeloid malignancies. For example, if approved for commercial sale for the treatment of MF, imetelstat would compete against Incyte Corporation’s ruxolitinib, or Jakafi®, which is orally administered. In clinical trials, Jakafi® reduced spleen size, abdominal discomfort, early satiety, bone pain, night sweats and itching in MF patients. Recently, there have also been reports of overall survival benefit as well as improvement in bone marrow fibrosis from Jakafi® treatment. Other treatment modalities for MF include hydroxyurea for the management of splenomegaly, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and 
 14


constitutional symptoms; splenectomy and splenic irradiation for the management of splenomegaly and co‑existing cytopenias, or low blood cell counts; chemotherapy and pegylated interferon. Drugs for the treatment of MF‑associated anemia include erythropoiesis stimulating agents, androgens, danazol, corticosteroids, thalidomide and lenalidomide. There are other investigational treatments for MF further along in development than imetelstat, such as pacritinib by CTI Biopharma Corporation, or CTI Biopharma and fedratinib by Impact Biomedicines, Inc., acquired by Celgene Corporation, or Celgene, which have reported results from Phase 3 clinical trials. Other investigational treatments for MF include inhibitors of the JAK‑STAT pathway, such as NS‑018 by NS Pharma, Inc.; histone deacetylase inhibitors; interleukin‑3 receptor targeted agents; inhibitors of heat shock protein 90; hypomethylating agents; PI3 Kinase and mTOR inhibitors; anti‑fibrosis antibodies such as PRM-151 from Promedior, Inc.; hedgehog and SMO inhibitors; PIM kinase inhibitors; IAP inhibitors; anti‑LOX2 inhibitors; recombinant pentraxin 2 protein; KIP‑1 activators; TGF‑beta superfamily inhibitors, such as sotatercept and luspatercept by Acceleron Pharma, Inc., or Acceleron, in collaboration with Celgene; FLT inhibitors; and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
 If approved for commercial sale for the treatment of lower risk MDS, imetelstat would compete against a number of treatment options, including erythropoiesis stimulating agents and other hematopoietic growth factors; immunomodulators, such as lenalidomide by Celgene; hypomethylating agents, such as azacitidine by Celgene and decitabine by Janssen; in addition to investigational treatments in MDS that may be further along in development than imetelstat, such as oral versions of azacitidine; histone deacetylase inhibitors; TGF‑beta superfamily inhibitors, such as luspatercept by Acceleron, in collaboration with Celgene; PI3 Kinase inhibitors; aminopeptidase inhibitors, such as tosedostat by CTI Biopharma; TLR2‑specific antibodies; anti‑CD33 antibodies; anti-CD38 antibodies, such as daratumumab by Genmab A/S in collaboration with Janssen; anti-CD123 antibodies, such as talacotuzumab by Janssen; retinoic acid receptor alpha agonists, such as SY-1425 by Syros Pharmaceuticals; hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, such as roxadustat by FibroGen, Inc.; Fas ligand inhibitors; and JAK‑STAT pathway inhibitors.
 Independently, Janssen is developing therapies for hematologic malignancies, including AML, MDS, multiple myeloma and ABC‑subtype diffuse large B‑cell lymphoma. Molecular and cellular pathways of interest include:
  
• | cell surface targets for immune‑directed therapy;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | immune checkpoint inhibition;
--+------------------------------


• | leukemia stem cells;
--+---------------------


• | pathway addiction (genetic alterations, cell‑type specific pathways);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | conditional sensitivity (stress, protein‑producing tumors);
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | targeting of T‑cells and natural killer “NK” cells to tumors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | identification of novel tumor‑specific antigens; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | progression from early MDS to AML and cancer interception.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 Success by Janssen in any of these approaches may compete with imetelstat or render imetelstat obsolete or noncompetitive, which could lead to a decision by Janssen to discontinue the imetelstat program and terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which would materially and adversely affect our business and business prospects and might cause us to cease operations.
 Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We anticipate increased competition in the future as new companies explore treatments for hematologic myeloid malignancies, which may significantly impact the commercial viability of imetelstat. Academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to imetelstat. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified development and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to the imetelstat program.
 15


In addition to the above factors, imetelstat will face competition based on:
  
• | product efficacy and safety;
--+-----------------------------


• | convenience of product administration;
--+---------------------------------------


• | cost of manufacturing;
--+-----------------------


• | the timing and scope of regulatory consents;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | status of coverage and reimbursement;
--+--------------------------------------


• | price; and
--+-----------


• | patent position, including potentially dominant patent positions of others.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As a result of the foregoing, competitors may develop more commercially desirable or affordable products than imetelstat, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than us or Janssen. Competitors have developed, or are in the process of developing, technologies that are, or in the future may be, competitive to imetelstat. Some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing therapeutic effects similar or superior to those that may be demonstrated by imetelstat. Competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective, or less costly than imetelstat, or more convenient to administer to patients and, therefore, present a serious competitive threat to imetelstat. In addition, competitors may price their products below what Janssen may determine to be an acceptable price for imetelstat, may receive better third‑party payor coverage and/or reimbursement, or may be more cost‑effective than imetelstat. Such competitive products or activities by competitors may render imetelstat obsolete, which may cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.
 Government Regulation
 Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of imetelstat, which is being developed in collaboration with Janssen. Imetelstat will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, potential human therapeutic products, such as imetelstat, are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in European and other countries. Various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, import, export, distribution and recordkeeping related to such products and their marketing. In collaboration with Janssen, the process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and money, and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled “Risks Related to Clinical Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization of Imetelstat” under Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.
United States Food and Drug Administration Regulatory Approval Process
 Prior to commencement of clinical trials involving humans, preclinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of a product candidate. The results of these trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin. The FDA can place an IND on clinical hold at any time, which prevents the conduct of clinical trials under the IND until safety concerns are addressed by the IND sponsor to the FDA’s satisfaction. Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase trial process. In Phase 1, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers or patients afflicted with a specific disease to assess safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body. In Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. The Phase 2 trials can be conducted comparing the investigational treatment to a comparator arm, or not. If used, a comparator usually includes standard of care therapy. Safety and efficacy data from Phase 2 clinical trials, even if favorable, may not provide sufficient rationale for proceeding to a Phase 3 clinical trial. In Phase 3, large scale, multi‑center, comparative trials are conducted with patients 
 16


afflicted with a target disease to provide sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re‑evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the trials. Human clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice regulations and applicable laws, with the oversight of Institutional Review Boards for the protection of human subjects. The manufacture of drug product candidates is subject to requirements that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current Good Manufacturing Practices and applicable laws.
 The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of drugs and complete manufacturing information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for review and for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales. Submission of an NDA requires the payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, which may be waived in certain cases. In responding to an NDA submission, the FDA may approve the drug for commercialization, impose limitations on its indications for use and labeling, including in the form of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies or may issue a complete response letter. Even if an NDA is approved, its sponsor is subject to ongoing and pervasive regulatory compliance requirements.
 European and Other Regulatory Approval Process
 Prior to initiating clinical trials in a region outside of the United States, a clinical trial application must be submitted and reviewed by the appropriate regulatory authority regulating the country in which the trial will be conducted. Whether or not FDA clearance or approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries is necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before granting it, even though the relevant product has been cleared or approved by the FDA or another authority. As with the FDA, the regulatory authorities in the European Union, or EU, and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining approval in particular countries varies, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval. In Europe, the European Medicine Agency, or EMA, and the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, or CPMP, provide a mechanism for EU member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing. The EU has established the EMA for the evaluation of medical products, with both a centralized procedure with which the marketing authorization is recognized in all EU member states and a decentralized procedure, the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries.
Orphan Drug Designation
 For a drug to qualify for orphan drug designation by the FDA, both the drug and the disease or condition must meet certain criteria specified in the Orphan Drug Act, or ODA, and FDA’s implementing regulations. Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA’s Office of Orphan Drug Products in order to support development of medicines for underserved or rare diseases and patient populations that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States or, if the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug would be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives of the ODA, including, if regulatory approval is received, the potential for seven years of market exclusivity with certain limited exceptions and certain tax credits for qualified clinical testing. A marketing application for a prescription drug product that has received orphan drug designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for a disease or condition other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was granted orphan drug designation. The granting of orphan drug designation does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. The safety and effectiveness of a drug must be established through adequate and well‑controlled studies. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.
 On June 11, 2015 and December 23, 2015, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to imetelstat for the treatment of MF and MDS, respectively.
 17


Orphan drug designation by the European Commission provides regulatory and financial incentives for companies to develop and market therapies that treat a life‑threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU, and where no satisfactory treatment is available. In the EU, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, as well as protocol assistance from the EMA during the product development phase, and direct access to the centralized authorization procedure. In addition, ten years of market exclusivity is granted following drug product approval, meaning that another application for marketing authorization of a later similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication will generally not be approved in the EU. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable to not justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 On December 14, 2015, the EMA granted orphan drug designation to imetelstat for the treatment of MF.
 Fast Track Designation
 Fast Track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA review staff, as well as eligibility for priority review, if relevant criteria are met, and rolling review. Fast Track designation is intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of a New Drug Application to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. However, Fast Track designation does not accelerate conduct of clinical trials or mean that the regulatory requirements are less stringent, nor does it ensure that imetelstat will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. In addition, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging from the imetelstat clinical development program.
 In October 2017, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to imetelstat for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low or Intermediate-1 risk MDS who are non-del(5q) and who are refractory or resistant to treatment with an ESA. Janssen sponsored the application for Fast Track designation using preliminary data from Part 1 of IMerge.
 Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations
 We may also be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These additional healthcare regulations could affect our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third‑party payors. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti‑kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, and physician payment sunshine laws.
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti‑Kickback Statute has been violated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act or ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate, in order to commit a violation.
 Federal civil and criminal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off‑label, or for providing medically unnecessary services or items. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Criminal prosecution is also possible for making or presenting a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
 18


The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, electronic exchange and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information upon entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non‑governmental third party payors, including private insurers. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. Further, we may be subject to state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and healthcare entities, or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non‑compliance with these laws or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Reimbursement and Healthcare Reform
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate that receives regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of imetelstat, if approved for commercial sale, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third‑party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for imetelstat.
 In the United States, third‑party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have

increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost‑effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA‑approved drugs for a particular indication. Janssen may need to conduct expensive pharmaco‑economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of imetelstat, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, imetelstat may not be considered medically necessary or cost‑effective.
 Moreover, the process for determining whether a third‑party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product, as there is no uniform coverage and reimbursement policy among third-party payors in the United States. Adequate third‑party reimbursement may not be available to enable Janssen to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on Janssen’s and our investment in imetelstat.
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted legislative and regulatory proposals to contain healthcare costs, as well as to improve quality and expand access. For example, in March 2010, the ACA, was signed into law that included a number of provisions of importance to the biopharmaceutical industry. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. Additionally, President Trump signed The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on December 22, 2017, which includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees. Congress may also consider other legislation to repeal or replace other elements of the ACA.
 We expect that other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for imetelstat.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States to control the rising cost of healthcare. For example, such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the price of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs, some of which are included in the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019.
