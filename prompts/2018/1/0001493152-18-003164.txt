ITEM 1. Business
About Our Business and How We Talk About It
 
We deliver interactive entertainment and innovative dining technology to bars and restaurants in North America. Customers subscribe to our customizable solution to differentiate themselves via competitive fun by offering guests trivia, card, sports and single player games, nationwide competitions, and by offering self-service dining features including dynamic menus, touchscreen ordering and secure payment. Our platform can improve operating efficiencies, create connections among the players and venues and amplify guests’ positive experiences. Built on an extended network platform, our interactive entertainment system has historically allowed multiple players to interact at the venue and more recently allows for competition between venues, referred to as massively multiplayer gaming. Our current platform, which we refer to as Buzztime Entertainment On Demand, or BEOND, was commercially launched during 2013 and then scaled during 2014. We continue to enhance our network architecture and the BEOND tablet platform and player engagement paradigms. We also continue to support our legacy network product line, which we refer to as Classic.
 
We currently generate revenue by charging subscription fees for our service to our network subscribers, by leasing equipment (including tablets used in our BEOND tablet platform and the cases and charging trays for the tablets) to certain network subscribers, by hosting live trivia events, by selling advertising aired on in-venue screens and as part of customized games, from providing professional services (such as developing certain functionality within our platform for customers), and from pay-to-play single player games.
 
Since 2015, over 115 million games were played on our network annually, and as of December 31, 2017, approximately 56% of our network subscriber venues are affiliated with national and regional restaurant brands, including Buffalo Wild Wings, Buffalo Wings & Rings, Old Chicago, Native Grill & Wings, Houlihans, Beef O’Brady’s, Boston Pizza, and Arooga’s.
 
We own several trademarks and consider the Buzztime®, Playmaker®, Mobile Playmaker, and BEOND Powered by Buzztime trademarks to be among our most valuable assets. These and our other registered and unregistered trademarks used in this document are our property. Other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

Recent Developments 
 
Amended and Restated Credit Facility
 
In November 2017, we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement (the “Amended and Restated Loan Agreement”) with East West Bank (“EWB”). The Amended & Restated Loan Agreement amends and restates the loan and security agreement that we entered into with EWB dated as of April 14, 2015 (as the same has been previously amended, the “Prior Loan Agreement”).
 
The following is a summary of the material terms of the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement:
 
●          EWB loaned us $4,500,000 as a one-time 36-month term loan, $4,450,000 of which we agreed to use, and did use, to refinance the $4,450,000 that we had outstanding under the Prior Loan Agreement. We applied the additional $50,000 to pay the facility fee ($45,000) and to pay reasonable costs or expenses incurred by EWB in connection with, among other matters, the preparation and negotiation of the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement.
 
●          We are required to make payments on the loan on the last calendar day of each month commencing on December 31, 2017 and through its maturity date, November 29, 2020. Payments will be interest only until the payment due on June 30, 2018, at which time payments will become principal plus interest.
 
●          Other than during the continuance of an event of default, the loan bears interest, on the outstanding daily balance thereof, at our option, at either: (A) a variable rate per annum equal to the prime rate as set forth in The Wall Street Journal plus 1.75%, or (B) a fixed rate per annum equal to the LIBOR rate for the interest period for the advance plus 4.50%.
 
●          We continue to grant and pledge to EWB a first-priority security interest in all our existing and future personal property, including our intellectual property, subject to customary exceptions.
 
●          Subject to customary exceptions, we continue to generally be prohibited from borrowing additional Indebtedness other than subordinated debt and up to $2.0 million in the aggregate for the purpose of equipment financing to the extent EWB approves such debt. “Indebtedness” means (i) all our other indebtedness for borrowed money or the deferred purchase price of property or services, (ii) all our obligations evidenced by notes, bonds, debentures and similar instruments, (iii) all our capital lease obligations, and (iv) all our contingent obligations. 
 
For additional information regarding this credit facility, see “PART II—ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” below.
 
Our Strategy
 
Below is a discussion of our strategy and highlights of accomplishments and milestones achieved during 2017:
 
Scale digital menu and payment functionality. We continue focusing on delivering digital menu and payment functionality on the tablet platform, which we believe will improve the operational and marketing value of our product offering. This expanded functionality will help us deliver an enhanced guest experience. Rolling out this functionality will continue to be a key focus for us in 2018. As previously announced in March 2017, we have expanded our relations with Buffalo Wild Wings, who chose us to be its provider of digital menu, order, and payment functionality, and since that time, we have continued making progress on the software integration. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed much of the integration work required for payment functionality and subsequently delivered the first batch of tablets with magnetic swipe, Europay, MasterCard® and Visa® (“EMV”) and Near-Field Communication (“NFC”) capabilities to 28 Buffalo Wild Wings locations. Due to the acquisition of Buffalo Wild Wings by Arby’s Restaurant Group, Inc., and to the attendant changes with Buffalo Wild Wings’ operations, the rollout of our expanded functionality has been put on hold until its new management has time to assess all of the programs at Buffalo Wild Wings. Based on discussions to date, we expect that the rollout could be put on hold for up to six months and that we could re-commence the rollout at additional Buffalo Wild Wings locations shortly thereafter. After the initial set of locations is running smoothly, we anticipate rolling out our system throughout the rest of Buffalo Wild Wings corporate and franchise locations with which we have partnered. We expect our inventory balances to fluctuate as we prepare to expand and support this relationship.


Improve value and price for our “independent” customers. During 2017, we continued to make progress on our hardware design and quality in order to reduce expense, while expanding capabilities, retaining consistency in the design and giving us the ability to offer flexibility in our pricing for quality independent customers. We are now deploying our new tablets and cases into the market and are better positioned in 2018 to acquire new independent sites and new venues in other vertical markets to help grow sites.
 
Refine our commercial execution. We are focused on increasing our site count of both independent customers and chain customers. Receiving a reference from a national chain account, such as Buffalo Wild Wings, is critical to our chain efforts, and our ability to demonstrate Buffalo Wild Wings as a strategic user of the menu, order and pay functionality is critical to receiving that reference. For our independent customers, we continue to model and test our go-to-market efforts by improving our sales processes, technology and people.
 
Expand revenue opportunities. We intend to grow the consumer audience by engaging them more with improved entertainment experiences and providing premium content that we can monetize through direct payment. In addition, we have been researching and testing our services within adjacent markets, such as senior centers, car dealerships and casinos. Although the growth of our previously announced partnership with Heartland has been slower than anticipated due to a variety of technical issues, we continue to work with Heartland and its dealer network. As we announced earlier this year, we entered into a licensing agreement with Scientific Games to license our trivia games for installation on casino slot machines where we will earn a per game license fee for each slot machine that has one of our trivia games installed on it. We have since sold a few contracts and are awaiting installation, which we expect to occur during the second quarter of 2018. We also developed a stand-alone, single unit tablet to serve Scientific Games customers in the market where casinos use tablets in retail settings to redeem loyalty points. We are excited about the value we feel we can bring to this market with both of these product offerings. We also continue to monetize the network through local and national advertising revenue streams. During the third quarter of 2017, we partnered with The Chive, a digital media company, to expand the size and reach of our network, which we believe will allow us to expand our advertising revenues. They have delivered sales as well as a pipeline for growth. Lastly, in January 2018, we signed our first contract to sell several thousands of our tablets to a customer who will deliver their services to their market. We expect to deliver these tablets and recognize revenue sometime between the second and third quarter of 2018. We are also working with this customer to license our gaming content for its customers, which may represent revenue sharing opportunity. We anticipate several follow-on tablet orders and believe that this is an exciting recurring revenue opportunity that can scale.

Products and Services
 
Our principal product and service is our BEOND platform. Built on an extended network platform, our interactive entertainment system offers trivia, card, sports and single player games, nationwide competitions, and self-service features including dynamic menus, touchscreen ordering and secure payment. Generally, as part of the subscription to our BEOND platform, we provide the equipment used in our BEOND platform (including tablets used in our BEOND tablet platform and the cases and charging trays for the tablets) to network subscribers, though we also lease such equipment to certain network subscribers. In 2017, we began licensing our content to customers to be installed on equipment that they obtain from other parties. In 2018, we began selling the equipment used in our BEOND platform to customers who may not subscribe to our BEOND platform but who can use the equipment in their business for other purposes. 
 
Our primary network subscribers are bars and restaurants in North America, which we target directly through our internal sales organization. More recently we have begun offering our BEOND platform in adjacent markets, such as senior centers, car dealerships and casinos, which we target through third parties who have existing business relationships with potential customers in such markets.
 
We primarily develop the content and functionality available through our BEOND platform internally. The tablet used in our BEOND platform is an Android-based tablet customized to our specifications by a single unaffiliated third-party manufacturer. Such third-party also manufacturers the cases and charging trays for the tablets. Such manufacturer sources the raw materials used to manufacture such equipment. See ITEM 1A., Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business—"A disruption in the supply of equipment could negatively impact our subscriptions and revenue” and “—Our business could be adversely impacted if the sole manufacturer of our customized tablet and our tablet equipment is not able to meet our manufacturing quality standards,” below.
 
Competition 
 
We face direct competition in venues and face competition for total entertainment and marketing dollars in the marketplace from other companies offering similar content and services. A relatively small number of direct competitors are active in the hospitality marketing services and entertainment markets, including Ziosk and E la Carte, Inc. Competing forms of technology, entertainment, and marketing available in hospitality venues include games, apps and other forms of entertainment offerings available directly to consumers on their smart phones and tablets, on-table bar and restaurant entertainment systems, music and video-based systems, live entertainment and games, cable, satellite and pay-per-view programming, coin-operated single-player games/amusements, and traffic-building promotions like happy hour specials and buffets.
Buzztime Significant Customer 
 
Our customers range from small independently operated bars and restaurants to bars and restaurants operated by national chains. This results in diverse venue sizes and locations. As of December 31, 2017, 2,730 venues in the U.S. and Canada subscribed to our interactive entertainment network, of which, approximately 45% were Buffalo Wild Wings corporate-owned restaurants and its franchisees (collectively, “Buffalo Wild Wings”). For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, revenue generated from Buffalo Wild Wings was as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
---------------------------+-----------------------------+----------
 | 2017 | | | 2016 | 
Buffalo Wild Wings revenue | $ | 8,678,000 | | | $ | 8,913,000 | 
Percent of total revenue | | 41 | % | | | 40 | %

 
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, amounts included in accounts receivable from Buffalo Wild Wings was as follows:
 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+--------
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Buffalo Wild Wings accounts receivable | $ | 191,000 | | $ | 261,000

Backlog 
 
We generally do not have a significant backlog because we normally can deliver and install new systems at venues within the delivery schedule requested by customers (generally within three to four weeks).
Licensing, Trademarks, Copyrights and Patents 
 
A majority of the gaming content available on our platform is internally developed. The balance is licensed from third parties. We also license third party content for our pay-to-play and free-to-consumer games lobby. The amounts paid for such third party licensed content was not material during either 2017 or 2016.
 
Our intellectual property assets, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights, are important to our business and, accordingly, we actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting our products.
 
We keep confidential as trade secrets our technology, know-how and software. Most of the hardware we use in our operations is purchased from a third party and customized for use with our service. We enter into agreements with third parties with whom we conduct business, which contain provisions designed to protect our intellectual property and to limit access to, and disclosure of, our proprietary information. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors.

We have trademark protection for the names of our key proprietary programming, products, and services to the extent that we believe trademark protection is appropriate. We are expanding our efforts to protect these investments. We consider the Buzztime, Playmaker, Mobile Playmaker and PlayersPlus trademarks and our other related trademarks to be valuable assets, and we seek to protect them through a variety of actions. Our content, branding, and some of our game titles, such as Countdown, SIX, and Showdown are also protected by copyright and trademark law.

Total | | 100 | % | | 100 | %

Government Contracts 
 
We provide our content distribution services through our network to colleges, universities, and a small number of government agencies, typically military base recreation units. However, the number of government customers is small compared to our overall customer base. We provide our products and services to government agencies under contracts with substantially the same terms and conditions as are in place with non-government customers.
Government Regulations 
 
The cost of compliance with federal, state, and local laws has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date. In December 2012, we received approval from the Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC, for our BEOND tablet charging trays, and in September 2015, we received FCC approval for our third generation BEOND tablet cases with and without payment electronics. The BEOND tablets we currently use have been certified by its manufacturer.

In addition to laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally, we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply directly to the interactive entertainment and product marketing industries. Additionally, state and federal governments may adopt additional laws and regulations that address issues related to certain aspects of our business such as:
 

● | user privacy; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | copyrights; 
● | gaming, lottery and alcohol beverage control regulations; 
● | consumer protection; 
● | the distribution of specific material or content; and 
● | the characteristics and quality of interactive entertainment products and services. 

 
As part of our service, we operate games of chance and games of skill. These games are subject to regulation in many jurisdictions. Our games are played just for fun and winner recognition. None of our games award anything of value to winners. In the future, we may provide nominal monetary prizes to trivia competition participants, in compliance with applicable regulations. Included in our offering are a number of interactive card games, such as Texas Hold’em poker. These card games are restricted in certain jurisdictions. The laws and regulations that govern these games, however, vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject to legislative and regulatory change, as well as law enforcement discretion. We may find it necessary to eliminate, modify, or cancel certain components of our offerings in certain states or jurisdictions based on changes in law, regulations and law enforcement discretion, which could result in additional development costs and/or the possible loss of customers and revenue.
 
Web Site Access to SEC Filings 
 
Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, and proxy statements and other information we file or furnish pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available on our website at www.buzztime.com/business/investor-relations/ under the heading SEC Filings as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such reports with, or furnish them to, the SEC. In addition, we make available on that same website under the heading Corporate Governance our (i) our code of conduct and ethics; (ii) our corporate governance guidelines; and (iii) the charter of each active committee of our board of directors. We intend to disclose any amendment to, or a waiver from, a provision of our code of conduct and ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions and that relates to any element of the code of ethics definition enumerated in paragraph (b) of Item 406 of Regulation S-K by posting such information on that website.
 
Materials we file with the SEC may also be read and copied at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding our company that we file electronically with the SEC.
 
Employees 
 
As of March 6, 2018, we employed approximately 104 people on a full-time basis and 342 people on a part-time basis. We also utilize independent contractors for specific projects. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our employee relations are satisfactory.
Our Corporate History
 
NTN Buzztime, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1984 as Alroy Industries and changed its corporate name to NTN Communications, Inc. in 1985. The name was changed to NTN Buzztime, Inc. in 2005 to better reflect the growing role of the Buzztime consumer brand.
