Overview
 We are medical device company focused on commercializing the Aquadex FlexFlow® system. Our commercial product, the Aquadex FlexFlow system, is indicated for temporary (up to eight hours) ultrafiltration treatment of patients with fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy and extended (longer than 8 hours) ultrafiltration treatment of patients with fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy and require hospitalization.
Company History
 Prior to July 2016, we were focused on developing the C-Pulse® Heart Assist System for treatment of Class III and ambulatory Class IV heart failure. The C-Pulse System utilized the known concept of counterpulsation applied to the aorta. In March 2016, we announced that we were no longer enrolling patients into our two clinical studies for the C-Pulse System and that we planned to pursue a new strategic direction. In July 2016, we announced that we were moving forward with a therapeutic strategy utilizing neuromodulation rather than counterpulsation.
 In August 2016, we acquired the Aquadex FlexFlow system business (the Aquadex Business) from Baxter, a global leader in the hospital products and dialysis markets.
 On September 29, 2016, we announced a strategic refocus of our near-term strategy that includes halting clinical evaluations of our neuromodulation technology to fully focus our resources on our recently acquired Aquadex Business, taking actions to reduce our cash burn in connection with such strategic refocus, and reviewing potential strategic alliances and financing alternatives.
 The Aquadex FlexFlow System 
 The Aquadex FlexFlow system is designed to simply, safely, and precisely remove excess fluid (primarily excess salt and water) from patients suffering from fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy. With the Aquadex FlexFlow system, medical practitioners can specify and control the amount of fluid to be extracted at a safe, predictable, and effective rate, in a process we refer to as Aquapheresis® therapy. All Aquapheresis treatments must be administered by a healthcare provider, under physician prescription, both of whom have received training in extracorporeal therapies. The Aquadex FlexFlow system has been shown to have no clinically significant impact on electrolyte balance, blood pressure or heart rate1.

  Benefits of the Aquadex FlexFlow System
 The Aquadex FlexFlow ultrafiltration system offers a safe approach to treating fluid overload and:
 
• | Provides complete control over rate and total volume of fluid removed by allowing a medical practitioner to specify the amount of fluid to be removed from each individual patient;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Aquapheresis therapy can be performed via peripheral or central venous access;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Removes isotonic fluid (extracts sodium while sparing potassium and magnesium)2;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Following ultrafiltration, neurohormonal activation is reset toward a more physiological condition and diuretic efficacy is restored3;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provides highly automated operation with only one setting required to begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utilizes a single-use, disposable auto-loading blood filter circuit that facilitates easy set-up;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The console guides medical practitioner through the setup and operational process; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decreased hospital readmissions and duration4.
--+-----------------------------------------------


The Aquadex FlexFlow system consists of:
 
• | A console, a piece of capital equipment containing electromechanical pumps and an LCD screen;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A one-time disposable blood set (the Aquadex Blood Set), an integrated collection of tubing, filter, sensors, and connectors that contain and deliver the blood from and back to the patient; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A disposable catheter (the Aquadex Catheter), a small, dual-lumen catheter designed to access the peripheral venous system of the patient and to simultaneously withdraw blood and return filtered blood to the patient.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Aquadex Blood Set is proprietary and the Aquadex FlexFlow system can only be used with the Aquadex Blood Set. The Aquadex Catheter is often used in conjunction with the Aquadex FlexFlow system, although it is one of many potential catheter options available to the provider. 
 Our Market Opportunity 
 Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and other developed countries. Based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Center for Health Statistics from 2011 to 2014, the American Heart Association estimates that 6.5 million people in the United States age 20 and over had heart failure5. Based on the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study from 2005 to 2013, conducted by the National Heart, Lund and Blood Institute, there are an estimated 960,000 new heart failure cases annually6. Annual hospitalizations for heart failure exceed 1 million in both the United States and Europe, and more than 90% are due to symptoms and signs of fluid overload7. Congestive heart failure is the highest U.S. chronic health care expense category8. 
 Heart failure is a progressive disease caused by impairment of the left hearts ability to pump blood to the various organs of the body. Patients with heart failure commonly experience shortness of breath, fatigue, difficulty exercising and swelling of the legs. The heart becomes weak or stiff and enlarges over time, making it harder for the left heart to pump the blood needed for the body to function properly. The severity of heart failure depends on how well a persons heart is able to pump blood throughout the body.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Heart failure is the leading cause of fluid overload, a condition where patients become decompensated resulting in lengthy and costly hospitalizations. In fact, 90% of heart failure patients present symptoms of fluid overload9. Our system is indicated for temporary (up to eight hours) ultrafiltration treatment of patients with fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy and extended (longer than 8 hours) ultrafiltration treatment of patients with fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy and require hospitalization. 
 According to a nationwide study of over 140,000 patients suffering from acute decompensated heart failure, over 38% of patients discharged were still symptomatic and about half of the patients were discharged with less than five pounds lost10. This clinical evidence from the ADHERE Registry clearly shows patients are discharged too early, while still showing evidence of fluid overload. By not truly addressing the fluid overload problem, patients are being readmitted to the hospital too frequently, with 30-day readmissions of 22% and 6-month readmissions of 44%, while 78% of patients are admitted directly to the Emergency Department as the first point of care11 12. 
 The Affordable Care Act includes a Hospital Readmission Reduction program and is designed to reduce payments to hospitals with excess heart failure readmissions, among other conditions. The penalty to hospitals can be significant, as much as 3% of total Medicare reimbursement. The Aquadex FlexFlow system is positioned to assist hospitals with the Affordable Care Act and may offer hospitals an economic benefit for using the device on a regular basis for in-patient or out-patient usage. 
 There are two market segments for treating fluid overload with the Aquadex FlexFlow system: 
 
1) | Inpatient Care—Provided to a patient admitted to a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home or other facility. Long term care is the range of services typically provided at skilled nursing, intermediate-care, personal care or eldercare facilities.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Outpatient Care—Any health care service provided to a patient who is not admitted to a facility. Outpatient care can be provided in a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital outpatient department.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our target customers for the Aquadex FlexFlow system include large academic hospitals specializing in advanced treatment of chronic heart failure, other large hospitals with heart failure related admissions and clinical practices with transplant or left ventricle assist device, known as LVAD, programs. Our largest customer, Mount Sinai Hospital, represented 14.4% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on us.
 Our Strategy
 Our mission is to predict, measure, and control patient fluid balance through science, collaboration, and innovative medical technology. We provide healthcare professionals with a sophisticated, yet easy to use, mechanical pump and filter system to remove excess fluid in fluid overloaded congestive heart failure patients and patients with related conditions. We believe that our technology will provide a competitive advantage in the fluid management market by providing improved clinical benefits and reducing the cost of care relative to other treatment alternatives. 
 Our strategic focus is to demonstrate a strong business model by driving revenue growth. Growing revenue is the key metric employees, shareholders and potential investors will use to judge our performance. In addition to revenues contribution to funding operations, revenue growth demonstrates a workable business model and proves a successful business turn-around. Management has identified five critical actions to drive revenue: (i) commercial execution, (ii) enhance product offerings, (iii) demonstrate health economic advantages, (iv) provide important new clinical evidence, and (v) increase partnerships with key opinion leading physicians.
 Commercial Execution Strategy – We have allocated, and plan to continue to allocate, resources to aggressively build sales and marketing strength and grow the worldwide market for the Aquadex FlexFlow system. In the third quarter of 2017, we increased our direct sales force by six employees and plan to further expand our direct sales force in 2018. Our trained sales team will focus on sales penetration in large hospital accounts. The Aquadex FlexFlow system can be used in a large hospital in multiple areas, including: the emergency

  department, the heart failure telemetry floor, the intensive care unit, and the coronary care unit. In addition to expending our direct sales force, we are implementing high quality customer service support systems and technical servicing to increase support to customers. We have also initiated international distribution and support of our products by entering into a distribution and service provider agreement with APC Cardiovascular Ltd., a distributor based in the United Kingdom. 
 Enhance Product Offering Strategy – We intend to develop products and product enhancements to improve performance and customer satisfaction. We have several projects currently underway to enhance product performance. We plan to introduce a new peripheral access catheter and enhance the functionality of the hematocrit sensor that is part of the Aquadex FlexFlow system console. We also are working to identify or develop a diagnostic tool for physicians to use during an Aquapheresis therapy to more precisely determine the amount of excess fluid to be removed, the rate of ultrafiltration, and when to stop therapy as dry weight is approached.
 Health Economics Strategy – We plan to develop new evidence regarding the economic impact of ultrafiltration on heart failure patients with fluid overload. We plan to publish information on the budgetary impacts to hospitals that adopt the Aquadex FlexFlow system into their continuum of care when treating critical heart failure patients with fluid overload in whom diuretic therapy has failed.
 New Clinical Evidence Strategy – We plan to expand the body of clinical evidence for Aquapheresis and the Aquadex FlexFlow system to drive adoption and support reimbursement. We plan to initiate an ultrafiltration mechanism of action clinical study to provide scientific evidence that demonstrate that Aquadex effectively decongests patients without causing kidney injury and to provide hypotheses explaining reduced heart failure events following ultrafiltration.
 Key Opinion Leaders Strategy – We plan to partner with key opinion leaders to advance medical understanding of the ultrafiltration as a therapy for treating fluid overload. We have recruited a scientific advisory board comprised of six key opinion leading physicians to help us develop and implement both the mechanistic clinical study and the registry. We are partnering with the Cardio Renal Society of America in a leadership role and increasing our involvement with the Heart Failure Society of America. In addition, we are working with several physicians that are implementing hospital observation unit use of the Aquadex FlexFlow system to provide outpatient care for patients that are fluid overloaded but may not require hospitalization. 
Sales and Marketing
 As of March 1, 2018, we had 19 full-time employees in sales and marketing. During the third quarter of 2017, we hired and trained six sales personnel with extensive medical device sales experience. Our sales force includes therapy development managers as well as field clinical engineers who provide training, technical and other support services to our customers. Since the acquisition of the Aquadex Business from Baxter in August 2016, our direct sales force has focused on re-engaging hospital accounts that ordered Aquadex Blood Sets in prior years, re-educating customers on the therapy and assessing each hospitals use of the Aquadex FlexFlow system to gain additional opportunity for increased utilization. We plan to grow the sales and marketing organization as necessary to support future growth. 
 Our sales representatives implement consumer marketing programs and provide physicians and nurses with patient educational materials. We also market to potential referral source clinicians in order to build awareness.
 Clinical Experience
 Several large-scale, multi-center, randomized, controlled trials have evaluated the use of ultrafiltration using the Aquadex FlexFlow system patients in patients with acute decompensated heart failure compared to standard-of-care treatment with intravenous diuretics. These trials followed early-stage studies which primarily focused on safety of ultrafiltration treatment with the Aquadex FlexFlow system. 
 The UNLOAD trial enrolled 200 patients and showed that average weight and fluid loss were greater in the ultrafiltration group 48 hours following randomization. No differences were noted in symptoms of dyspnea between the groups. In addition, through 90 days of follow-up, the ultrafiltration group experienced fewer re-hospitalizations for heart failure, while renal function assessed by serum creatinine level was not significantly different between the groups.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  The CARRESS trial studied 188 randomized acute decompensated heart failure patients over the course of 96 hours and found no difference in weight loss and an increase in creatinine level relative to the control group treated with intravenous diuretics. The creatinine increase was interpreted as a sign of potential worsening renal function in the ultrafiltration group. Results of CARRESS have been criticized on several grounds, particularly that trial results were impacted by centers unfamiliar with the use of ultrafiltration therapy and that the diuretic regimen employed was not representative of standard-of-care. In addition, a recent analysis of the DOSE trial to explore the putative link between short-term changes in creatinine level and outcome in acute decompensated heart failure has found that the intragroup difference observed in CARRESS does not fall into a range associated with adverse long-term outcomes including death, re-hospitalization or visits to the emergency department. Such events were examined in CARRESS over 60 days and no differences were detected between the groups. 
 Disparate results between UNLOAD and CARRESS led to initiation of the AVOID-HF trial. AVOID-HF was designed to prospectively address the question of patient outcomes when treated with ultrafiltration versus intravenous diuretics for acute decompensated heart failure. Trial design assumptions indicated that 810 patients would need to be randomized to achieve adequate statistical power. However, the study was terminated at 224 patients for business reasons by Baxter. Despite being underpowered, the results of AVOID-HF indicated distinct trends toward reduced composite heart-failure events in the ultrafiltration group over 90 days. In addition, pre-specified secondary endpoints demonstrated significant reductions in heart failure re-hospitalization at 30 days. No significant differences were observed in creatinine level between the groups, although a trend toward increase may have been present at 48 hours. In totality, AVOID-HF recapitulated the results of both UNLOAD and CARRESS while providing evidence that had AVOID-HF been followed to completion it would likely have met its primary endpoint of improved outcome in acute decompensated heart failure patients. 
 We anticipate conducting additional clinical studies to provide further evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the Aquadex FlexFlow system and to support obtaining a specific reimbursement code for Aquapheresis therapy.
 Other uses of ultrafiltration with the Aquadex FlexFlow system have not been studied extensively. Case studies and case series demonstrating the use of ultrafiltration in the maintenance of outpatient heart failure have been published, but there has been no prospective, systematic evaluation of ultrafiltration versus standard-of-care for this population. Other potential uses also largely remain to be formally evaluated.
 Research and Development
 Research and development costs include activities related to research, development, design, and testing improvements to the Aquadex FlexFlow system and potential related products. The Aquadex FlexFlow system software will require periodic modifications for feature additions and performance improvements. We will make such design changes as needed based on pro-active and reactive mechanisms. Research and development costs also include expenses related to clinical research. We may sponsor or conduct additional clinical research related to the Aquadex FlexFlow system to enhance understanding of the product and its use.
Manufacturers and Suppliers
 In connection with the acquisition of the Aquadex Business, we entered into a commercial manufacturing and supply agreement with Baxter, which required Baxter to manufacture Aquadex Blood Sets and Aquadex Catheters for a period of 18 months following our acquisition of the Aquadex Business. In May 2017, we notified Baxter that we intended to have it cease the manufacturing Aquadex product effective as of June 30, 2017. We completed the transfer of manufacturing equipment for the Aquadex Business that we purchased from Baxter to our manufacturing facility in July 2017. We began manufacturing Aquadex FlexFlow products in-house in the fourth quarter of 2017. We continued to purchase raw materials and finished goods from an indirect subsidiary of Baxter until February 1, 2018.
Intellectual Property
 We have established an intellectual property portfolio through which we seek to protect our system and technology. In connection with our acquisition of the Aquadex Business, we entered into a patent license agreement with Baxter pursuant to which we obtained, for no additional consideration, a world-wide license to 49 exclusively licensed and 9 non-exclusively licensed patents used in connection with the Aquadex FlexFlow system to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import, the Aquadex FlexFlow system in the field of use. The field of use is defined as system and apparatus only capable of performing isolated ultrafiltration for 


 5

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  treatment of congestive heart failure and methods to the extent used therein (excluding system, apparatus, or methods performing any kind of renal therapy or dialysis and/or any system capable of providing substitution fluid). The license is exclusive, with respect to some patents, and non-exclusive, with respect to other patents. Under the patent license agreement, Baxter has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue maintenance of seven required maintenance patents, and we have agreed to reimburse Baxter for all fees, costs, and expenses (internal or external) incurred by Baxter in connection with such continued maintenance. The rights granted to us under the patent license agreement will automatically revert to Baxter in the event we cease operation of the Aquadex Business or we file for, have filed against us, or otherwise undertake any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, or other similar proceeding. For two years following the closing, the patent license agreement is not assignable by us (including in connection with a change of control) without Baxters prior written consent. We estimate that the patents licensed from Baxter will expire between approximately 2020 and 2025. 
 In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we owned 40 issued patents and five pending patent applications in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions related to our C-Pulse System and had two pending applications for neuromodulation. We estimate that most of our currently issued U.S. patents will expire between approximately 2021 and 2027. Given the strategic refocus away from C-Pulse and towards the Aquadex FlexFlow system, we have chosen to limit the maintenance of issued C-Pulse related patents to those innovations that are of the highest value. Further, we have elected to emphasize a few of the most critical jurisdictions rather than maintain the earlier approach that involved multiple countries. Our pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will provide us any financial return. Even if issued, existing or future patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to obtain commercial benefits from them.
 We have developed technical knowledge that, although non-patentable, we consider to be significant in enabling us to compete. It is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with each of our employees and consultants prohibiting the disclosure of any confidential information or trade secrets. In addition, these agreements provide that any inventions or discoveries by employees and consultants relating to our business will be assigned to us and become our sole property. 
 Despite our patent rights and policies with regard to confidential information, trade secrets and inventions, we may be subject to challenges to the validity of our patents, claims that our system infringes the patent rights of others and the disclosure of our confidential information or trade secrets. These and other risks are described more fully under the heading Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Intellectual Property. 
 At this time we are not a party to any material legal proceedings that relate to patents or proprietary rights.
 Competition
 Competition from medical device companies and medical device divisions of health care companies, pharmaceutical companies and gene- and cell-based therapies is intense and expected to increase. The vast majority of heart failure patients with fluid overload receive pharmacological treatment (diuretics) as a standard of care. There are no direct competitors for the Aquadex FlexFlow system in the U.S., other than diuretics. Other systems, such as Baxters Prismaflex, a filter-based device that is approved for continuous renal replacement therapy for patients weighing 20kg or more with acute renal failure and/or fluid overload, represent indirect competitors, as they can also be used to conduct ultrafiltration. 
 Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to distinguish Aquadex FlexFlow system from our competitors and their products. Factors affecting our competitive position include:
 
• | Financial resources;
--+---------------------


• | Product performance and design;
--+--------------------------------


• | Risk management;
--+-----------------


• | Product safety;
--+----------------


• | Acceptance of our system in the marketplace;

Third-Party Reimbursement
 In the United States, the Aquadex FlexFlow products are purchased primarily by customers, such as hospitals or other health care providers. Customers bill various third-party payers for covered Aquadex FlexFlow services provided to patients. These payers, which include federal health care programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), state health care programs, private health insurance companies, and managed care organizations, then reimburse our customers based on established payment formulas that take into account part or all of the cost associated with these devices and the related procedures performed. 
 While the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has not issued a favorable national coverage for ultrafiltration using the Aquadex FlexFlow system, a number of private insurers have approved reimbursement for Aquadex FlexFlow system use for specific indications and points of service. In addition, patients and providers may seek insurance coverage on a case-by-case basis. 
 We are exploring the ability to increase the range of coverage for uses of Aquadex FlexFlow therapies, such as use in the outpatient setting and other indicated uses under its approved labeling. 
 Legislative proposals can substantially change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and may negatively impact payment rates for our system. Also, from time to time, there are a number of legislative, regulatory and other proposals both at the federal and state levels that may impact payment rates for our system. It remains uncertain whether there will be any future changes that will be proposed or finalized and what effect, if any, such legislation or regulations would have on our business. However, in the United States and international markets, we expect that both government and third-party payers will continue to attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care by challenging the prices charged, or deny coverage, for health care products and services.
 Government Regulations
 Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of our current system and any future products and in our ongoing research and development activities. In particular, medical devices are subject to rigorous pre-clinical testing as a condition of approval by the FDA and by similar authorities in foreign countries. Any proposed products will require regulatory approval prior to commercialization.
United States
 The FDC Act and the FDAs implementing regulations govern medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post market surveillance. Medical devices and their manufacturers are also subject to inspection by the FDA. The FDC Act, supplemented by other federal and state laws, also provides civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions. We manufacture and market medical devices that are regulated by the FDA, comparable state agencies and regulatory bodies in other countries. 
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require marketing authorization from the FDA prior to distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization are premarket notification (also called 510(k) clearance) and premarket approval (PMA). The type of marketing authorization applicable to a device—510(k) clearance or PMA—is generally linked to classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the extent of control deemed 


 7

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  necessary to ensure the devices safety and effectiveness. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification, and adherence to the FDAs current good manufacturing practice requirements, as reflected in its Quality System Regulation (QSR). Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post market surveillance. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, and include life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, and devices not substantially equivalent to a device that is already legally marketed. 
 Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from FDA. Class I and Class II devices that have not been exempted are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway. By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require PMA prior to commercial marketing. The PMA process is generally more stringent, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process. 
 510(k) Clearance. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device legally marketed in the United States. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics or (ii) different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more. 
 After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA (if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device). The determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 
 The Aquadex FlexFlow system was granted FDA 510(k) clearance for commercial use on June 3, 2002. Additional 510(k) clearances have been received for the Aquadex FlexFlow system in subsequent years. 
 Clinical Trials. To obtain FDA approval to market the C-Pulse System, clinical trials would be required to support a PMA application. We have halted clinical trials related to the C-Pulse System. These trials generally require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. 
 FDA approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward, but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the products safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. With certain exceptions, changes made to an investigational plan after an IDE is approved must be submitted in an IDE supplement and approved by FDA (and by governing institutional review boards when appropriate) prior to implementation. 
 All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with regulations and requirements collectively known as Good Clinical Practice. Good clinical practices include the FDAs IDE regulations, which describe the conduct of clinical trials with medical devices, including the recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of sponsors and investigators, and labeling of investigational devices. They also prohibit promotion, test marketing 


 8

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  or commercialization of an investigational device and any representation that such a device is safe or effective for the purposes being investigated. Good Clinical Practices also include the FDAs regulations for institutional review board approval and for protection of human subjects (such as informed consent), as well as disclosure of financial interests by clinical investigators. 
 Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application or clearance of a premarket notification for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
 
• | the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial (or a change to a previously approved protocol or trial that requires approval) or place a clinical trial on hold;

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continuing Regulation. After a device is cleared or approved for use and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 
• | establishment registration and device listing upon the commencement of manufacturing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during medical device design and manufacturing processes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and promotional activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if malfunctions were to recur;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act caused by the device that may present a risk to health.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We and our contract manufacturers and our suppliers are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements set forth in the QSR. 
 The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing and record keeping. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers is not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to clear or approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers, or our other employees. Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Employees

 We are, and will remain, a smaller reporting company as long as our public float remains less than $75 million as of the last business day of our most recently-completed second fiscal quarter. A smaller reporting company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to U.S. public companies. These provisions include an exemption from the attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting by our independent auditors pursuant to section 404 (b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) but do not preclude us from the requirement to make our own internal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We were an

  emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 until the expiration of that status on December 31, 2017. We do not expect the expiration of our emerging growth company status to have a material impact on our business.
 On June 1, 2017, we received a notification from Nasdaq informing us that we were no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, as the bid price of our shares of common stock closed below the minimum $1.00 per share for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the notice. Nasdaq also notified us that we were provided 180 calendar days, or until November 28, 2017, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. Accordingly, on October 12, 2017, following stockholder approval on October 10, 2017, we implemented a 1-for-20 reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. On October 27, 2017, we received formal notice from Nasdaq that we had regained compliance with the minimum $1.00 bid price requirement, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), and the matter is now closed. We cannot assure you that we will be able continue to meet the Nasdaq listing standards. If we do not continue to meet any of the Nasdaq listing standards, our common stock may be subject to delisting from Nasdaq.
