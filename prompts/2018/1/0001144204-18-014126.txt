Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a blank check company whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). We were incorporated in Delaware on November 19, 2008, as Leucadia Development Corporation and changed our name to Landcadia Holdings Inc. on September 15, 2015. We are currently in the process of locating suitable targets for our Business Combination. We intend to use the cash proceeds from our public offering and private placement of warrants as well as additional issuances, if any, of our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt to complete the Business Combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
The Company’s co-Sponsors are Fertitta Entertainment, Inc. (the “FEI Sponsor”) and Leucadia National Corporation (the “Leucadia Sponsor” and, together with FEI Sponsor, the “Sponsors”). Tilman J. Fertitta, the Company’s Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the sole stockholder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Fertitta Entertainment, Inc., and Richard Handler, the Company’s Co-Chairman and President, is the Chief Executive Officer of Leucadia National Corporation and its largest operating subsidiary, Jefferies Group LLC, a global securities and investment banking firm.
 
On June 1, 2016, we consummated our initial public offering (the “public offering”) of 25,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (the “units”), generating total proceeds of $250,000,000. Each unit consists of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value (“public shares”) and one redeemable common stock purchase warrant (each, a “public warrant”). Each public warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-half of one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. Simultaneously with the consummation of the public offering, our Sponsors purchased an aggregate of 14,000,000 warrants, at a price of $0.50 per warrant, each exercisable to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share (the “sponsor warrants”), in a private placement (the “private placement”), generating total proceeds of $7,000,000. The sponsor warrants are identical to the public warrants sold as part of the units in the public offering except that, so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, (i) they will not be redeemable by us, (ii) they (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the completion of our initial Business Combination and (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis.
 
Prior to the public offering, in 2008, the Leucadia Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 1,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (100% of the issued and outstanding shares) for $1,000. On September 15, 2015, the Company increased the total number of authorized shares of all classes of capital stock to 221,000,000, of which 200,000,000 shares are Class A shares at par value $0.0001 per share; 20,000,000 shares are Class F shares at par value $0.0001 per share; and 1,000,000 shares are Preferred stock at par value $0.0001 per share.

On September 15, 2015, the Company reclassified all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock to Class F common stock (the “founders shares”), and conducted a 1:7,187.5 stock split. On September 16, 2015, the Company issued 7,187,500 additional founder shares to the FEI Sponsor for $10,000. On October 1, 2015, the Company completed a 5:1 reverse stock split of the founder shares. On April 27, 2016, the Company conducted a 1:3 stock split, and on May 25, 2016, each of the Sponsors returned to the Company, at no cost, 718,750 founders shares (1,437,500 total shares), which were cancelled. The underwriters did not exercise their over-allotment option in connection with the public offering and as such, the Sponsors forfeited 937,500 founder shares, which were returned to the Company, at no cost, on June 30, 2016. Following these transactions, each of the Sponsors owned 50% of the 6,250,000 issued and outstanding founders shares.
 
Upon the closing of the public offering and the private placement, $250,000,000 was placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”). Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay income taxes and franchise taxes, if any, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) provides that none of the funds held in trust will be released from the Trust Account until the earlier of (i) the completion of the Business Combination; or (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Certificate of Incorporation to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of the public shares if the Company does not complete the Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the public offering; or (iii) the redemption of 100% of the public shares if the Company is unable to complete the Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the public offering. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.
 
After the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion of $8,750,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions, which will be payable upon consummation of our initial Business Combination if consummated) and approximately $655,000 in expenses relating to the public offering, approximately $1,000,000 of the net proceeds of the public offering and private placement was not deposited into the Trust Account and was retained by us for working capital purposes. The net proceeds deposited into the Trust Account remain on deposit in the Trust Account earning interest. As of December 31, 2017, there was $252,054,977 in investments and cash held in the Trust Account and $571,748 of cash held outside the Trust Account available for working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2017, no funds had been withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay taxes. We have a current tax liability of $448,099 related to trust earnings offset by losses from operations.
 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash held in the Trust Account, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration. We may seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial Business Combination
 
While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or sector, we intend to focus on identifying a Business Combination opportunity in industries or sectors that complement our management team’s background, and to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and operate a business, focusing on the dining, hospitality, entertainment and gaming industries in the United States. We believe our management team is well positioned to take advantage of the growing set of investment opportunities focused in the dining, hospitality, entertainment and gaming industries, to create value for our stockholders, and that our contacts and sources, ranging from owners of private and public companies, private equity funds, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and business brokers in these sectors will allow us to generate attractive acquisition opportunities. Our Certificate of Incorporation prohibits us from effectuating a Business Combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations.
 
Our initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple business in unrelated industries in connection with our initial Business Combination. We anticipate structuring our initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire substantially all of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than substantially all of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses even if the acquisitions of the target businesses are not closed simultaneously. 
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent ownership, management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the Business Combination transaction.
 
The time required to evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Business Combination. We will not pay any finder’s or consulting fees to our Sponsors, officers or directors, or any of our or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the completion of our Business Combination. However, we will not be prohibited from engaging an affiliate of our Leucadia Sponsor or its affiliates as financial advisors in connection with our initial Business Combination and paying a customary financial advisory fee in an amount that constitutes a market standard financial advisory fee for comparable transactions, although we are not under any contractual obligation, and have no present intent, to do so.

Redemption rights for holders of public shares upon consummation of our initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial Business Combination, including interest, less income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial Business Combination with respect to our warrants. Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial Business Combination.
 
Conduct of redemptions pursuant to tender offer rules
 
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), we will, pursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
 
Submission of our initial Business Combination to a stockholder vote
 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial Business Combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. In such case, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after the initial public offering in favor of our initial Business Combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, and any public shares they may hold in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial Business Combination. However, other than as expressly stated herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the Business Combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the Business Combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial Business Combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Limitation on redemption rights upon completion of our initial Business Combination if we seek stockholder approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering. We believe the restriction described above will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a Business Combination if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our Business Combination, particularly in connection with a Business Combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those stockholders that hold more than 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering) for or against our Business Combination.
 
Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial Business Combination
 
The Sponsors, our executive officers and directors have agreed that we will have until June 1, 2018 to complete our initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination by June 1, 2018, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial Business Combination by June 1, 2018.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting Business Combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial Business Combination.
Facilities
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 1510 West Loop South, Houston, Texas 77027. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee that we pay our FEI Sponsor for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have five executive officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time that Messrs. Fertitta, Handler or any of our other executive officers or directors will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been identified for our initial Business Combination and the stage of the Business Combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination.
Available Information
 
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The public may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov.
