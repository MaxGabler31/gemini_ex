Item 1. – Business
Overview
 We are a pure-play, low-cost producer of high-quality Northern White raw frac sand, which is a preferred proppant used to enhance hydrocarbon recovery rates in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells. We sell our products primarily to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and oilfield service companies under a combination of long-term take-or-pay contracts and spot sales in the open market. We believe that the size and favorable geologic characteristics of our sand reserves and the strategic location and logistical advantages of our facilities have positioned us as a highly attractive source of raw frac sand to the oil and natural gas industry. We incorporated in Delaware in July 2011.
 We own and operate a raw frac sand mine and related processing facility near Oakdale, Wisconsin, at which we have approximately 321 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves as of December 31, 2017. We began operations with 1.1 million tons of nameplate processing capacity in July 2012, expanded to 2.2 million tons of nameplate capacity in August 2014 and increased to 3.3 million tons in September 2015. Our integrated Oakdale facility, with on-site rail infrastructure and wet and dry sand processing facilities, has access to two Class I rail lines that allows us to ship on a unit train basis on either rail carrier and currently enables us to process and cost-effectively deliver up to approximately 3.3 million tons of raw frac sand per year. We are in the process of expanding our processing facilities at Oakdale to enable us to process and sell up to approximately 5.5 million tons of raw frac sand per year.  We expect this expansion will be completed and operational in the second quarter of 2018. 
 In addition to the Oakdale facility, we own a second property in Jackson County, Wisconsin, which we call the Hixton site. The Hixton site is also located adjacent to a Class I rail line and is fully permitted to initiate operations and is available for future development. As of December 31, 2017, our Hixton site had approximately 100 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves.

We have also entered into two long-term surface mining leases for properties located in the Permian Basin in Texas that are available for future development.  The first site consists of 1,772 acres in Winkler County, Texas.  This location is adjacent to the Texas & New Mexico Railway (TXN) short line with direct access to State Highway 18.  The second site consists of 2,447 acres in Crane County, Texas. This location has direct access to Interstate Highway 20 and has been awarded a Certificate of Inclusion into the Texas Conservation Plan (“TCP”) for the dunes sagebrush lizard. The TCP is designed to protect dunes sagebrush lizard habitat while facilitating continued and uninterrupted economic activity in the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin sites have been acquired for a combined cost of less than $5,000,000 and have low associated royalty payments. We estimate that the sites collectively have several hundred million tons of frac sand reserves.
 For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we generated net income of approximately $21.5 million, $10.4 million and $5.0 million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $30.6 million, $37.8 million and $23.9 million, respectively. For the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), please read “Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  For more financial information about our business, please read “Selected Financial Data”.
 Over the past decade, exploration and production companies have increasingly focused on exploiting the vast hydrocarbon reserves contained in North America’s unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs by utilizing advanced techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. In recent years, this focus has resulted in exploration and production companies drilling more and longer horizontal wells, completing more hydraulic fracturing stages per well and utilizing more proppant per stage in an attempt to maximize the volume of hydrocarbon recoveries per wellbore. Spears and Associates, Inc. (“Spears”) expects proppant levels per well to continue to increase from 7,100 tons per well in 2018 to approximately 7,700 tons per well in 2020.  In addition, raw frac sand continues to be the preferred proppant used by operators.  Spears estimates that raw frac sand represented approximately 97% of total proppant demand in 2017 as exploration and production companies continued to look closely at overall well cost, completion efficiency and design optimization, which led to a greater use of raw frac sand in comparison to resin-coated sand and manufactured ceramic proppants.
 Northern White raw frac sand, which is found predominantly in Wisconsin and limited portions of Minnesota and Illinois, is highly valued by oil and natural gas producers as a preferred proppant due to its favorable physical characteristics. We believe that the market for high-quality raw frac sand, like the Northern White raw frac sand we produce, will grow based on the potential recovery in the development of North America’s unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs as well as the increased proppant volume usage per well, particularly with respect to finer mesh sizes. We expect the trend of using larger volumes of finer mesh materials, such as 100 mesh sand and 40/70 sand, to continue.
 Competitive Strengths
 We believe that we will be able to successfully execute our business strategies because of the following competitive strengths:
  
• | Long-lived, strategically located, high-quality reserve base. We believe our Oakdale facility is one of the few raw frac sand mine and production facilities that has the unique combination of a large high-quality reserve base of primarily fine mesh sand that is contiguous to its production and primary rail loading facilities. Our Oakdale facility is situated on 1,196 acres in a rural area of Monroe County, Wisconsin, with access to two Class I rail lines, and contains approximately 321 million tons of proven recoverable reserves as of December 31, 2017. We have an implied proven reserve life of approximately 97 years based on our current annual nameplate processing capacity of 3.3 million tons per year. As of December 31, 2017, we have utilized 221 acres for facilities and mining operations, or only 19% of this location’s acreage. We believe that with further development and permitting, the Oakdale facility ultimately could be expanded to allow production of up to 9 million tons of raw frac sand per year.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe our reserve base positions us well to take advantage of current market trends of increasing demand for finer mesh raw frac sand. Approximately 80% of our reserve mix today is 40/70 mesh substrate and 100 mesh substrate, considered to be the finer mesh substrates of raw frac sand. We believe that if oil and natural gas exploration and production companies continue recent trends in drilling and completion techniques to increase lateral lengths per well, the number of frac stages per well, the amount of proppant used per stage and the utilization of slickwater completions, the demand for the finer grades of raw frac sand will continue to increase, which we can take advantage of due to the high percentage of high-quality, fine mesh sand in our reserve base.
 We also believe that having our mine, processing facilities and primary rail loading facilities at our Oakdale facility provides us with an overall low-cost structure, which enables us to compete effectively for sales of raw frac sand and to achieve attractive operating margins. The proximity of our mine, processing plants and primary rail loading facilities at one location eliminates the need for us to truck sand on public roads between the mine and the production facility or between wet and drying processing facilities, eliminating additional costs to produce and ship our sand.

In addition to the Oakdale facility, we own the Hixton site in Jackson County, Wisconsin. The Hixton site is a second location adjacent to a Class I rail line that is fully permitted to initiate operations and is available for future development. As of December 31, 2017, our Hixton site had approximately 100 million tons of proven recoverable sand reserves. We have also optioned two properties in the Permian Basin of West Texas under long term leases and are currently evaluating options to develop one or both of these sites into fully operational raw frac sand mines to primarily support the growing demand for raw frac sand in the Permian Basin.  We acquired these locations at a low upfront cost and with minimal ongoing required royalty payments, which allows us time to evaluate potential market demand to support any investment in developing one or both of these sites on a cost-effective basis.
  
• | Intrinsic logistics advantage. We believe that we are one of the few raw frac sand producers with a facility custom-designed for the specific purpose of delivering raw frac sand to all of the major U.S. oil and natural gas producing basins by an on-site rail facility that can simultaneously accommodate multiple unit trains. Our on-site transportation assets at Oakdale include approximately nine miles of rail track in a triple-loop configuration and, upon completion of our current expansion, four railcar loading facilities that are connected to a Class I rail line owned by Canadian Pacific. We believe our customized on-site logistical configuration typically yields lower operating and transportation costs compared to manifest train or single-unit train facilities as a result of our higher railcar utilization, more efficient use of locomotive power and more predictable movement of product between mine and destination. In addition, we have a transload facility on a Class I rail line owned by Union Pacific in Byron Township, Wisconsin, approximately 3.5 miles from the Oakdale facility. This transload facility allows us to ship sand directly to our customers on more than one Class I rail carrier. This facility commenced operations in June 2016 and is now capable of handling multiple unit trains simultaneously which provides increased delivery options for our customers, greater competition among our rail carriers and potentially lower freight costs. With the addition of this transload facility, we believe we are the only mine in Wisconsin with dual served railroad shipment capabilities on the Canadian Pacific and Union Pacific rail networks. Our Hixton site is also located adjacent to a Class I rail line.

• | Significant organic growth potential. We believe that we have a significant pipeline of attractive opportunities to expand our sales volumes and production capacity at our Oakdale facility, which commenced commercial operations in July 2012 and was expanded to 3.3 million tons of annual nameplate processing capacity in September 2015. We are currently in the process of increasing our nameplate dry plant processing capacity to approximately 5.5 million tons per year. We expect this expansion project to be completed and operational during the second quarter of 2018. We believe that, under current regulations and permitting requirements, we can ultimately expand our annual production capacity at Oakdale to as much as 9 million tons. Other growth opportunities include the ability to develop regional raw frac sand mines outside of Wisconsin, such as the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, to invest in transload facilities located in the shale operating basins, and to invest in last mile solutions to support frac sand delivery to the wellhead for our customers. Investments in regional sand mines would enable us to diversify our sand mining asset base and provide raw frac sand to customers looking to source their raw frac sand needs from suppliers in closer proximity to their drilling and completion activities. Investments in additional rail loading facilities should enable us to provide more competitive transportation costs and allow us to offer additional pricing and delivery options to our customers. Investments in last mile solutions at the wellhead would provide us with the opportunity to provide incremental logistical services to our customers related to their use of raw frac sand. We also have opportunities to expand our sales into the industrial sand market which would provide us the opportunity to diversify our customer base and sales product mix. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. We believe we have a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity to pursue our growth initiatives. As of March 1, 2018, we have approximately $61.9 million in liquidity from cash on hand and full availability of our $45 million revolving credit facility. Additionally, unlike some of our peers, we have minimal exposure to unutilized railcars. As of March 1, 2018, we have 2,298 under long-term leases, of which 1,250 are currently rented to our customers, which minimizes our exposure to storage railcars and leasing expense for railcars that are currently not being utilized for sand shipment and provides us greater flexibility in managing our transportation costs prospectively.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on safety and environmental stewardship. We are committed to maintaining a culture that prioritizes safety, the environment and our relationship with the communities in which we operate. In August 2014, we were accepted as a “Tier 1” participant in Wisconsin’s voluntary “Green Tier” program, which encourages, recognizes and rewards companies for voluntarily exceeding environmental, health and safety legal requirements. In addition, we committed to certification under ISO standards and, in April 2016, we received ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 registrations for our quality management system and environmental management system programs, respectively. We believe that our commitment to safety, the environment and the communities in which we operate is critical to the success of our business. We are one of a select group of companies who are members of the Wisconsin Industrial Sand Association, which promotes safe and environmentally responsible sand mining standards. In addition, one of our land leases in the Permian Basin has been awarded a Certificate of Inclusion into the TCP for the dunes sagebrush lizard. The TCP is designed to protect dunes sagebrush lizard habitat while facilitating continued and uninterrupted economic activity in the Permian Basin.

Business Strategies
 Our principal business objective is to be a pure-play, low-cost producer of high-quality raw frac sand and to increase stockholder value. We expect to achieve this objective through the following business strategies:

• | Focusing on organic growth by increasing our capacity utilization and processing capacity. We intend to continue to pursue opportunities to maximize the value and the utilization of our Oakdale facility in Wisconsin as a pure-play producer of high-quality Northern White raw frac sand. We believe the proppant market continues to offer attractive long-term growth fundamentals for Northern White raw frac sand. According to Spears, demand in 2017 for proppant increased by approximately 41% from the prior record set in 2014. Spears estimates that over the next three years proppant demand is projected to grow by 12.5% per year, from 103 million tons per year in 2017 to 165 million tons per year in 2020, as exploration and production operators drilling for oil and natural gas continue to increase their use of horizontal drilling and continue to increase proppant loadings per well drilled through longer lateral well lengths and increased proppant per lateral foot drilled. Additionally, we believe raw frac sand will continue to be a preferred proppant by operators due to the cost advantages of raw frac sand over resin-coated sand and manufactured ceramics. At the completion of our current expansion, our Oakdale facility will have annual nameplate processing capacity of approximately 5.5 million tons per year. We believe that with further development and permitting the Oakdale facility could ultimately be expanded to allow annual nameplate production capacities of as much as 9 million tons of raw frac sand per year. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimizing our logistics infrastructure and developing additional origination and destination points. We intend to further optimize our logistics infrastructure and develop additional origination and destination points. We expect to capitalize on our Oakdale facility’s ability to simultaneously accommodate multiple unit trains on two Class I rail carriers to maximize our product shipment rates, increase railcar utilization and lower transportation costs. With our recently completed expansion of our transloading facility located on the Union Pacific rail network approximately 3.5 miles from our Oakdale facility, we now have the ability to ship our raw frac sand on unit trains directly to our customers on more than one Class I rail carrier. This facility provides increased delivery options for our customers, greater competition among our rail carriers and potentially lower freight costs. In addition, we intend to continue evaluating ways to reduce the landed cost of our products at the basin for our customers, such as investing in transload, storage facilities and last mile solutions in our target shale basins to increase our customized service offerings and provide our customers with additional delivery and pricing alternatives, including selling product on an “as-delivered” basis at our target shale basins.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focusing on being a low-cost producer and continuing to make process improvements. We will continue to focus on being a low-cost producer, which we believe will permit us to compete effectively for sales of raw frac sand and to achieve attractive operating margins. Our low-cost structure results from a number of key attributes, including, among others, our (i) relatively low royalty rates, (ii) balance of coarse and fine mineral reserve deposits and corresponding contractual demand that minimizes yield loss, and (iii) Oakdale facility’s proximity to two Class I rail lines and other sand logistics infrastructure, which helps reduce transportation costs, fuel costs and headcount needs. We have strategically designed our operations to provide low per-ton production costs. For example, as part of our Oakdale expansion, we are enclosing two dryers and one wet plant in a single building to allow these processing plants to operate on a year-round basis which should allow us to more efficiently match our wet sand production with our drying capacity and to better utilize our workforce with a goal to reduce overall production costs. In addition, we seek to maximize our mining yields on an ongoing basis by targeting sales volumes that more closely match our reserve gradation in order to minimize mining and processing of superfluous tonnage. We also continue to evaluate the potential of mining by dredge and other mining techniques to reduce the overall cost of our mining operations.

• | Pursuing accretive acquisitions and greenfield opportunities. As of March 1, 2018, we have approximately $61.9 million of liquidity in the form of cash on hand and full availability of our $45 million revolving credit facility. We believe this level of liquidity will position us to pursue strategic acquisitions to increase our scale of operations and our logistical capabilities as well as to potentially diversify our mining and production operations into locations other than our current Oakdale and Hixton locations. We have optioned two properties in the Permian Basin of West Texas under long term leases and are currently evaluating options to develop one or both of these sites into fully operational raw frac sand mines to primarily support the growing demand for raw frac sand in the Permian Basin. We acquired these locations at a low upfront cost and with minimal ongoing required royalty payments, which allows us time to evaluate potential market demand to support any investment in developing one or both of these sites on a cost-effective basis. We will also continue to evaluate other regional low-cost greenfield projects, where we can capitalize on our technical knowledge of geology, mining and processing.

• | Maintaining financial strength and flexibility. We plan to pursue a disciplined financial policy to maintain financial strength and flexibility. We believe that our cash on hand, available borrowing capacity and ability to access debt and equity capital markets will provide us with the financial flexibility necessary to achieve our organic expansion and acquisition strategy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Customers and Contracts
 We sell raw frac sand under long-term take-or-pay contracts as well as in the spot market if we have excess production and the spot market conditions are favorable. As of March 1, 2018, we will have approximately 91.7% of our current annual nameplate capacity of 3.3 million tons per year contracted with a volume-weighted average remaining term of approximately 2.4 years. 
 Demand for proppants in 2015 and through the first half of 2016 dropped due to the downturn in commodity prices since late 2014 and the corresponding reduction in oil and natural gas drilling, completion and production activity. The change in demand during this period impacted contract discussions and negotiated terms with our customers as existing contracts were adjusted, resulting in a combination of reduced average selling prices per ton, and adjustments to take-or-pay volumes and lengths of contracts. We believe we have mitigated the short-term negative impact on revenues of some of these adjustments through contractual shortfall and reservation payments. During the market downturn, customers began to purchase more volumes on a spot basis as compared to committing to long-term contracts, and this trend continued until oil and natural gas drilling and completion activity began to increase beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016. In 2017, drilling and completion activity returned to higher levels, and we believe customers will begin to more actively consider contracting proppant volumes under term contracts rather than continuing to rely on buying proppant on a spot basis in the market.
 Capital Plans
 Based on our assessment of increased demand for our products, particularly fine mesh sand, we have decided to increase our annual nameplate processing capacity at our Oakdale facility to 5.5 million tons of raw frac sand. We have also decided to expand rail and logistics infrastructure in Wisconsin to support this potential increase in customer demand. Additionally, we continue to evaluate other proposed projects and related expenditures, such as investments in transload facilities and last mile solutions located in the shale operating basins, in light of customer demand and energy market trends. There can be no assurance, however, that all or any of these initiatives will be executed or that the results therefrom will be materially beneficial to our financial performance. 
Industry Trends Impacting Our Business
 Unless otherwise indicated, the information set forth under “—Industry Trends Impacting Our Business,” including all statistical data and related forecasts, is derived from The Freedonia Group’s Industry Study #3535, “Proppants Market in North America,” published in July 2017, Spears’ “Hydraulic Fracturing Market 2006 - 2018” published in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the supplement published in the first quarter of 2018, and Baker Hughes’ “North America Rotary Rig Count” published in February 2018. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the proppant industry data presented herein, estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors”.

Demand Trends
 According to Spears, the U.S. proppant market, including raw frac sand, ceramic and resin-coated proppant, was approximately 103 million tons in 2017. Freedonia estimates that the total raw frac sand market in 2017 represented approximately 96.5% of the total proppant market by weight. According to Spears, market demand in 2017 increased by approximately 41% from the prior record set in 2014. Spears estimates that over the next three years proppant demand will grow by 12.5% per year, from 103 million tons per year in 2017 to 165 million tons per year in 2020, representing an increase of approximately 62 million tons in annual proppant demand over that time period.
 

Demand growth for raw frac sand and other proppants is primarily driven by advancements in oil and natural gas drilling and well completion technology and techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. These advancements have made the extraction of oil and natural gas increasingly cost-effective in formations that historically would have been uneconomic to develop. While current horizontal rig counts have fallen significantly from their peak of approximately 1,370 in 2014 to approximately 800 at the end of 2017, rig count grew 254% from the recent low of approximately 315 rigs in May of 2016 to approximately 800 at the end of 2017. According to the Baker Hughes Rig Count, the percentage of active drilling rigs used to drill horizontal wells, which require greater volumes of proppant than vertical wells, has increased from 68.4% in 2014 to 83.9% in 2017. Moreover, the increase of pad drilling has led to a more efficient use of rigs, allowing more wells to be drilled per rig. As a result of these factors, well count, and hence proppant demand, has grown despite the fall in rig counts. Spears estimates that proppant demand will reach 142 million tons in 2018, which is nearly twice the 2014 levels of approximately 73 million tons, despite their projection assuming that approximately 4,600 fewer wells will be drilled in 2018 as compared to 2014. Spears also estimates that average proppant usage per well will be approximately 7,100 tons per well in 2018 and will rise to approximately 7,700 tons per well by 2020. 
 
Demand for proppant has sharply increased since 2016 in connection with the ongoing recovery in commodity prices and the corresponding increase in oil and natural gas drilling and production activity. We believe that the demand for proppant will continue to increase over the medium and long term as commodities stabilize from their lows in 2016, which will lead producers to continue to draw down their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells and undertake new drilling activities. Further, we believe that demand for proppant will be amplified by the following factors:
 
 
• | improved drilling rig productivity, resulting in more wells drilled per rig per year;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of exploration and production companies’ inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increases in the percentage of rigs that are drilling horizontal wells;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increases in the length of the typical horizontal wellbore;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | increases in the number of fracture stages per foot in the typical completed horizontal wellbore;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increases in the volume of proppant used per fracturing stage; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | renewed focus of exploration and production companies to maximize ultimate recovery in active reservoirs through downspacing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent growth in demand for raw frac sand has outpaced growth in demand for other proppants, and industry analysts predict that this trend will continue. As well completion costs have increased as a proportion of total well costs, operators have increasingly looked for ways to improve per well economics by lowering costs without sacrificing production performance. To this end, the oil and natural gas industry is shifting away from the use of higher-cost proppants towards more cost-effective proppants, such as raw frac sand. Evolution of completion techniques and the substantial increase in activity in U.S. oil and liquids-rich resource plays has further accelerated the demand growth for raw frac sand.
 Historically, oil and liquids-rich wells use a higher proportion of coarser proppant while dry gas wells typically use finer grades of sand. In the past, with the majority of U.S. exploration and production spending focused on oil and liquids-rich plays, demand for coarser grades of sand exceeded demand for finer grades; however, due to innovations in completion techniques, demand for finer grade sands has shown a considerable resurgence. 
 Supply Trends
 In 2017, customer demand for high-quality raw frac sand outpaced supply. Several factors contributed to this supply shortage, including:
  
• | the rapid recovery of the unconventional oil and gas industry supported by higher commodity pricing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the lack of development of new sand mines during the downturn in 2015 and 2016;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | logistical challenges on delivering sand in the higher quantities required by the new higher proppant intensity wells;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the hurdles to securing mining, production, water, air, refuse and other federal, state and local operating permits from the proper authorities in the development of new mines;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | local opposition to development of certain facilities, especially those that require the use of on-road transportation, including moratoria on raw frac sand facilities in multiple counties in Wisconsin and Minnesota that hold potential sand reserves; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the long lead time required to design and construct sand processing facilities that can efficiently process large quantities of high-quality raw frac sand.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Supplies of high-quality Northern White raw frac sand are limited to select areas, predominantly in western Wisconsin and limited areas of Minnesota and Illinois. The ability to obtain large contiguous reserves in these areas is a key constraint and can be an important supply consideration when assessing the economic viability of a potential raw frac sand facility. Further constraining the supply and throughput of Northern White raw frac sand is that not all of the large reserve mines have onsite excavation and processing capability. Additionally, much of the capital investment in Northern White raw frac sand mines was used to develop coarser deposits in western Wisconsin. With the shift to finer sands in the liquid and oil plays, many mines may not be economically viable as their ability to produce finer grades of sand may be limited.
 Permits
 We operate in a highly regulated environment overseen by many government regulatory and enforcement bodies at the local, state and federal levels. To conduct our mining operations, we are required to have obtained permits and approvals that address environmental, land use and safety issues at our Oakdale facility, Byron transload facility and our Hixton mine location. Our current and planned areas for excavation at our Oakdale property are permitted for extraction of our proven reserves. Portions of our Oakdale property lie in areas designated as wetlands, which will require additional local, state and federal permits prior to mining and reclaiming those areas.
 We also meet requirements for several international standards concerning safety, greenhouse gases and rail operations. We have voluntarily agreed to meet the standards of the Wisconsin DNR’s “Green Tier” program, the “National Industrial Sand Association” (“NISA”) and the “Wisconsin Industrial Sand Association.” Further, we have agreed to meet the standards required to maintain our ISO 9001-2015 and ISO 14001-2015 quality/environmental management system registrations. These voluntary requirements are tracked and managed along with our permits. In addition, one of our land leases in the Permian Basin has been awarded a Certificate of Inclusion into the TCP for the dunes sagebrush lizard.  The TCP is designed to protect dunes sagebrush lizard habitat while facilitating continued and uninterrupted economic activity in the Permian Basin.
 While resources invested in securing permits are significant, this cost has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot ensure that existing environmental laws and regulations will not be reinterpreted or revised or that new environmental laws and regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional environmental requirements that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our Customers and Contracts
 Our core customers are major oil and natural gas exploration and production and oilfield service companies. These customers have signed long-term take-or-pay contracts, which mitigate our risk of non-performance by such customers. Our contracts provide for a true-up payment in the event the customer does not take delivery of the minimum annual volume of raw frac sand specified in the contract and has not purchased in certain prior periods an amount exceeding the minimum volume, resulting in a shortfall. The true-up payment is designed to compensate us, at least in part, for our margins for the applicable contract year and is calculated by multiplying the contract price (or, in some cases, a discounted contract price) by the tonnage shortfall. Any sales of the shortfall volumes to other customers on the spot market would provide us with additional margin on these volumes. Additionally, some of our contracts include monthly reservation charges that the customer is required to pay for minimum monthly volumes regardless of whether the customer takes delivery of the sand. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Rice Energy, Liberty, Weatherford, and US Well Services accounted for 27.1%, 20.6%, 13.7%, 10.2%, respectively, of our total revenues, and the remainder of our revenues represented sales to sixteen customers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, EOG Resources, US Well Services, Weatherford and Nabors Completion & Production Services accounted for 37.5%, 22.4%, 25.4% and 10.8%, respectively, of our total revenues, and the remainder of our revenues represented sales to five customers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, EOG Resources, US Well Services, Weatherford, and Archer Pressure Pumping accounted for 35.0%, 24.6%, 18.4% and 15.8%, respectively, of our total revenues, and the remainder of our revenues represented sales to three customers. Please read “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in Our Business—A substantial majority of our revenues have been generated under contracts with a limited number of customers, and
 the loss of, material nonpayment or nonperformance by or significant reduction in purchases by any of them could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.” Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, we will have approximately 55.0% of our expanded annual nameplate production capacity of 5.5 million tons per year contracted with a volume-weighted average remaining term of approximately 2.4 years. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we generated approximately 79.8%, 97.6% and 96.4%, respectively, of our revenues from raw frac sand delivered under long-term take-or-pay contracts. We sell raw frac sand under long-term contracts, as well as in the spot market if we have excess production and the spot market conditions are favorable.
 Our current contracts include price ranges indexed to the price of crude oil (based upon the average WTI as listed on www.eia.doe.gov).  Our contracts contain provisions allowing for adjustment including: (i) annual percentage price escalators, or (ii) market factor increases (and in some cases decreases), including a natural gas surcharge/reduction and/or a propane surcharge/reduction which are applied if the Average Natural Gas Price or the Average Quarterly Mont Belvieu TX Propane Spot Price, respectively, as listed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, are above or below the applicable benchmark set in the contract for the preceding calendar quarter. 
 Our contracts generally provide that, if we are unable to deliver the contracted minimum volume of raw frac sand, the customer has the right to purchase replacement raw frac sand from alternative sources, provided that our inability to supply is not the result of an excusable delay. In the event that the price of replacement raw frac sand exceeds the contract price and our inability to supply the contracted minimum volume is not the result of an excusable delay, we are responsible for the price difference, up to a specified limit. At December 31, 2017, we had significant levels of raw frac sand inventory on hand; therefore, we consider the likelihood of any such penalties as remote.
 Certain of our contracts allow the customer to defer a portion of the annual minimum volume to future contract years, subject to a maximum deferral amount. The mesh size specifications in our contracts vary and include a mix of 20/40, 30/50, 40/70 and 100 mesh raw frac sand. In the event that one or more of our current contract customers decides not to continue purchasing our raw frac sand following the expiration of its contract with us, we believe that we will be able to sell the volume of sand that they previously purchased to other customers through long-term contracts or sales on the spot market.

Competition
 The proppant industry is highly competitive. Please read “Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in Our Business—We face significant competition that may cause us to lose market share.” There are numerous large and small producers in all sand producing regions of the United States with whom we compete. Our main competitors include Badger Mining Corporation, Emerge Energy Services LP, Fairmount Santrol, Hi-Crush Partners LP, Unimin Corporation and U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc.
 Although some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, we believe that we are competitively well positioned due to our low cost of production, transportation infrastructure and high-quality, balanced reserve profile. The most important factors on which we compete are product quality, performance, sand characteristics, transportation capabilities, reliability of supply and price. Demand for raw frac sand and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our products, to the extent not subject to a fixed price or take-or-pay contract, are closely linked to proppant consumption patterns for the completion of oil and natural gas wells in North America. These consumption patterns are influenced by numerous factors, including the price for hydrocarbons, the drilling rig count and hydraulic fracturing activity, including the number of stages completed and the amount of proppant used per stage. Further, these consumption patterns are also influenced by the location, quality, price and availability of raw frac sand and other types of proppants such as resin-coated sand and ceramic proppant.
 Seasonality
 Our business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations in weather that impact the production levels at our wet processing plant. While our dry plants are able to process finished product volumes evenly throughout the year, our excavation and our wet sand processing activities have historically been limited to primarily non-winter months. As a consequence, we have experienced lower cash operating costs in the first and fourth quarter of each calendar year, and higher cash operating costs in the second and third quarter of each calendar year when we overproduced to meet demand in the winter months.  These higher cash operating costs were capitalized into inventory and expensed when these tons are sold, which can lead to us having higher overall production costs in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year as we expense inventory costs that were previously capitalized. However, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we finished construction of our new, wet plant, which is an indoor facility that allows us to produce wet sand inventory year-round to support a portion of our dry sand processing capacity, which may reduce certain of the effects of this seasonality. We may also sell raw frac sand for use in oil and natural gas producing basins where severe weather conditions may curtail drilling activities and, as a result, our sales volumes to those areas may be reduced during such severe weather periods. For a discussion of the impact of weather on our operations, please read “Risk Factors—Seasonal and severe weather conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition” and “Risk Factors—Our cash flow fluctuates on a seasonal basis.”
Insurance
 We believe that our insurance coverage is customary for the industry in which we operate and adequate for our business. As is customary in the proppant industry, we review our safety equipment and procedures and carry insurance against most, but not all, risks of our business. Losses and liabilities not covered by insurance would increase our costs. To address the hazards inherent in our business, we maintain insurance coverage that includes physical damage coverage, third-party general liability insurance, employer’s liability, business interruption, environmental and pollution and other coverage, although coverage for environmental and pollution-related losses is subject to significant limitations.
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
 We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of worker health, safety and the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. Private parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. In addition, the trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, these laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly pollution control equipment, the occurrence of delays in the permitting or performance of projects, or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
 12


We do not believe that compliance by us with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. We cannot assure you, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions adverse to our operations will not cause us to incur significant costs. The following is a discussion of material environmental and worker health and safety laws, as amended from time to time that relate to our operations or those of our customers that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Air Emissions
 Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and related state and local laws, which restrict the emission of air pollutants and impose permitting, monitoring and reporting requirements on various sources. These regulatory programs may require us to install emissions abatement equipment, modify operational practices, and obtain permits for existing or new facilities or operations. Obtaining air emissions permits has the potential to delay the development or continued performance of our operations. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or to address other air emissions-related issues. Changing and increasingly stringent requirements, future non-compliance, or failure to maintain necessary permits or other authorizations could require us to incur substantial costs or suspend or terminate our operations.
 Climate change
 In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”). It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other regulatory initiatives are expected to be proposed that may be relevant to GHG emissions issues. In addition, a number of states are addressing GHG emissions, primarily through the development of emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control GHG emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations. Independent of Congress, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has adopted regulations controlling GHG emissions under its existing authority under the CAA. For example, following its findings that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment because such emissions contributed to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources for conventional pollutants. The EPA also has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified production, processing, transmission and storage facilities in the United States on an annual basis. In addition, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (the “Paris Agreement”).  The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 170 nations, including the United States, ratified or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the agreement.  However, in June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to re-enter into the Paris Agreement on different terms or enter into a separate agreement.  In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the United States’ intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.  To the extent that the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and natural gas industry, it could have an adverse effect on our business because substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Finally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our mining and processing operations.
 
Water Discharges
 The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into state waters or waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements require containment to mitigate or prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an oil overflow, rupture or leak, and the development and maintenance of Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure, or SPCC, plans at our facilities. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by the Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) pursuant to an appropriately issued permit. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The EPA has issued final rules attempting to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States but this rule has been stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as that appellate court and numerous district courts ponder lawsuits opposing implementation of 
 13


the rule. In January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court accepted review of the rule to determine whether jurisdiction rests with the federal district or appellate courts. Additionally, following the issuance of a presidential executive order to review the rule, the EPA and the Corps proposed a rulemaking to repeal the rule in June 2017. The EPA and the Corps also announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction. In January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that jurisdiction to hear challenges to the rule rests with the federal district courts.  Also in January 2018, the EPA and Corps issued a rule to delay the applicability of the rule for two years.  As a result, future implementation of the rule is uncertain at this time. To the extent this rule or a revised rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for expansion activities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
 
Hydraulic Fracturing
 We supply raw frac sand to hydraulic fracturing operators in the oil and natural gas industry. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and increasingly common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and oil from low permeability hydrocarbon bearing subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, proppants, and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock, increase permeability and stimulate production. Although we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, our customers purchase our raw frac sand for use in their hydraulic fracturing activities. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies. Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Aside from state laws, local land use restrictions may restrict drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. Municipalities may adopt local ordinances attempting to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether or, at a minimum, allow such fracturing processes within their jurisdictions to proceed but regulating the time, place and manner of those processes. In addition, federal agencies have started to assert regulatory authority over the process and various studies have been conducted or are currently underway by the EPA, and other federal agencies concerning the potential environmental impacts and, in some instances, have pursued voter ballot initiatives of hydraulic fracturing activities. At the same time, certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly limit or otherwise regulate the hydraulic fracturing process, and legislation has been proposed by some members of Congress to provide for such regulation.
 The adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal or state levels imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells, increase our customers’ costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our raw frac sand. In addition, heightened political, regulatory, and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices could expose us or our customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, which could be time-consuming, costly, or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm. We could be directly affected by adverse litigation involving us, or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance limits the ability of our customers to operate. Such costs and scrutiny could directly or indirectly, through reduced demand for our raw frac sand, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Non-Hazardous and Hazardous Wastes
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws control the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. These laws and regulations govern the generation, storage, treatment, transfer and disposal of wastes that we generate. In the course of our operations, we generate waste that are regulated as non-hazardous wastes and hazardous wastes, obligating us to comply with applicable standards relating to the management and disposal of such wastes. In addition, drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in May 2016, several non-governmental environmental groups filed suit against the EPA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for failing to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and natural gas wastes, asserting that the agency is required to review its Subtitle D regulations every three years but has not conducted an assessment on those oil and natural gas waste regulations since July 1988. The EPA and the non-governmental environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on December 28, 2016. Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose, by no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our customers’ costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes and a corresponding decrease in their drilling operations, which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Site Remediation
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”) and comparable state laws impose strict, joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of a disposal site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. We have not received notification that we may be potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA at any site.
Endangered Species
 The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. As a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) was required to consider listing numerous species as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act before the completion of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. The FWS did not meet the deadline. Current ESA listings and the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we or our customers operate could cause us or our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures and could result in delays or limitations in our or our customers’ performance of operations, which could adversely affect or reduce demand for our raw frac sand. For example, the dunes sagebrush lizard, which is found only in the active and semi-stable shinnery oak dunes of southeastern New Mexico and adjacent portions of Texas, was a candidate species for listing under the ESA by the FWS for many years.  In 2010, the FWS proposed listing the dunes sagebrush lizard as an endangered species under the ESA.  In response, the Texas Comptroller’s Office created the TCP in 2012 to minimize disturbances to the dunes sagebrush lizard’s habitat.  In June 2012, the FWS declined to list the species as endangered under the ESA.  Recently, however, as a result of increased frac sand mining, the Texas Comptroller’s Office, FWS and environmental groups have voiced concerns about the potential destruction of dunes sagebrush lizard habitat and harm to the species, which could ultimately lead to renewed calls to FWS to list the dunes sagebrush lizard under the ESA.
Mining and Workplace Safety
 Our sand mining operations are subject to mining safety regulation. The U.S. Mining Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) is the primary regulatory organization governing raw frac sand mining and processing. Accordingly, MSHA regulates quarries, surface mines, underground mines and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with and located at quarries and mines. The mission of MSHA is to administer the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and to enforce compliance with mandatory miner safety and health standards. As part of MSHA’s oversight, representatives perform at least two unannounced inspections annually for each above-ground facility. 
 OSHA has promulgated new rules for workplace exposure to respirable silica for several other industries. Respirable silica is a known health hazard for workers exposed over long periods. MSHA is expected to adopt similar rules as part of its “Long Term Items” for rulemaking. Airborne respirable silica is associated with work areas at our site and is monitored closely through routine testing and MSHA inspection. If the workplace exposure limit is lowered significantly, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for equipment to reduce this exposure. Smart Sand also adheres to the NISA’s respiratory protection program, and ensures that workers are provided with fitted respirators and ongoing radiological monitoring.
 Environmental Reviews
 Our operations may be subject to broad environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended, (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all “major federal actions” significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The granting of a federal permit for a major development project, such as a mining operation, may be considered a “major federal action” that requires review under NEPA. As part of this evaluation, the federal agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including, among other things, impacts on air quality, water quality, wildlife (including threatened and endangered species), historic and archeological resources, geology, socioeconomics, and aesthetics. NEPA also requires the consideration of alternatives to the project. The NEPA review process, especially the preparation of a full environmental impact statement, can be time consuming and expensive. The purpose of the NEPA review process is to inform federal agencies’ decision-making on whether federal approval should be granted for a project and to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of a proposed project. Though NEPA requires only that an environmental evaluation be conducted and does not mandate a particular result, a federal agency could decide to deny a permit or impose certain conditions on its approval, based on its environmental review under NEPA, or a third party could challenge the adequacy of a NEPA review and thereby delay the issuance of a federal permit or approval.
 15


State and Local Regulation
 We are subject to a variety of state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states, including Wisconsin where our current projects are located, have state laws similar to NEPA; thus, our development of a new site or the expansion of an existing site may be subject to comprehensive state environmental reviews even if it is not subject to NEPA. In some cases, the state environmental review may be more stringent than the federal review. Our operations may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project’s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations, and scenic areas. Wisconsin has specific permitting and review processes for commercial silica mining operations, and state agencies may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building, and transportation requirements.
 Demand for raw frac sand in the oil and natural gas industry drove a significant increase in the production of frac sand. As a result, some local communities expressed concern regarding silica sand mining operations. These concerns have generally included exposure to ambient silica sand dust, truck traffic, water usage and blasting. In response, certain state and local communities have developed or are in the process of developing regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize dust from becoming airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly curtail the amount of practicable area for mining activities, provide compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining activities and, in some cases, ban issuance of new permits for mining activities. To date, we have not experienced any material impact to our existing mining operations or planned capacity expansions as a result of these types of concerns. We would expect this trend to continue as oil and natural gas production increases.
 In August 2014, we were accepted as a “Tier 1” participant in Wisconsin’s voluntary “Green Tier” program, which encourages, recognizes and rewards companies for voluntarily exceeding environmental, health and safety legal requirements. Successful Tier 1 participants are required to demonstrate a strong record of environmental compliance, develop and implement an environmental management system meeting certain criteria, conduct and submit annual performance reviews to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, promptly correct any findings of non-compliance discovered during these annual performance reviews, and make certain commitments regarding future environmental program improvements. Our most recent annual report required under the Tier 1 protocol was submitted to the Green Tier Program contact on August 1, 2017.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed 198 people. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
