Overview
 
Novavax, Inc., together with our wholly-owned Swedish subsidiary, Novavax AB, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of recombinant nanoparticle vaccines and adjuvants. Using innovative proprietary recombinant nanoparticle vaccine technology, we produce vaccine candidates to efficiently and effectively respond to both known and emerging disease threats.
 
We were incorporated in 1987 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 20 Firstfield Road, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20878, and our telephone number is (240) 268-2000. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “NVAX.”
 
Our vaccine candidates are genetically engineered three-dimensional nanostructures that incorporate recombinant proteins critical to disease pathogenesis and may elicit differentiated immune responses, which may be more efficacious than naturally occurring immunity or traditional vaccine. Our product pipeline targets a variety of infectious diseases, with clinical vaccine candidates against respiratory syncytial virus (“RSV”), influenza and Ebola virus (“EBOV”), and preclinical programs for other infectious disease vaccine candidates.
 
We are also developing immune stimulating saponin-based adjuvants through our wholly owned Swedish subsidiary, Novavax AB. Our lead adjuvant, Matrix-M™, has been shown to enhance immune responses and was well-tolerated in multiple clinical trials that we have conducted.
 
Product Pipeline
 
Our product pipeline includes vaccine candidates engineered to elicit differentiated immune responses with the potential to provide increased protection. Our nanoparticle technology targets antigens with conserved epitopes essential for viral function. Our vaccine technology has the potential to be applied broadly to a wide variety of human infectious diseases.

A current summary of our significant research and development programs and status of the related product candidates in development follows:
 
Respiratory Syncytial Virus 
 
We have identified three susceptible target populations that could benefit from the development of our respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate (“RSV F Vaccine”) in different formulations: infants via maternal immunization, older adults (60 years of age and older) and children six months to five years of age (“pediatrics”). We believe our RSV F Vaccine represents a multi-billion dollar revenue opportunity, worldwide. Currently, there is no approved RSV vaccine available.

Repeat infection and lifelong susceptibility to RSV are common and we currently estimate the global cost burden of RSV to be in excess of $88 billion.1 Despite decades of effort to develop an RSV vaccine, there are currently no licensed vaccines. We made a breakthrough in developing a vaccine that targets the fusion protein, or F-protein, of the virus. The F-protein has highly conserved amino acid sequences, called antigenic sites, which we believe are ideal vaccine targets. We genetically engineered a novel F-protein antigen resulting in enhanced immunogenicity by exposing a number of these antigenic sites. The Novavax RSV F Vaccine assembles into a recombinant protein nanoparticle optimized for F-protein antigen presentation. We are seeking to bring the first RSV vaccine to market to combat the 64 million RSV infections that occur globally each year.2,3
 
RSV Infants via Maternal Immunization Program
 
Burden of Disease
 
RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections and the leading viral cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide.4,5 In the U.S., RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization of infants, and globally, is second only to malaria as a cause of death in children under one year of age.6,7 Despite the induction of post-infection immunity, repeat infection and lifelong susceptibility to RSV is common.8,9
Clinical Trial Update
 
Prepare Phase 3 Trial (Ongoing)
 
We initiated Prepare™, a global pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine, using aluminum phosphate as an adjuvant, in approximately of 4,600 healthy pregnant women in December 2015. The primary objective of the Prepare trial is to determine the efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV F Vaccine against symptomatic RSV lower respiratory tract infection with objective measures of medical significance in infants through a minimum of the first 90 days of life and up to the first six months of life.
 
The Prepare trial utilizes a group sequential design. We will initiate a prescribed interim efficacy analysis when we have approximately 4,600 enrolled women, currently expected in mid-2018, and report results from this interim analysis, expected in early 2019. Assuming successful interim analysis results, the trial would be concluded without further enrollment. In 2017, with approximately 1,300 participants in the Prepare trial, we conducted an informational analysis that provided a positive indication of our vaccine’s potential efficacy (between 45% and 100%10), further de-risking this important program. These results have allowed us to make go-forward decisions relating to various program-related activities.
 
The Prepare trial is supported by a grant (the “Grant”) of up to $89.1 million from BMGF. The Grant supports development activities, product licensing efforts and World Health Organization (“WHO”) prequalification of our RSV F Vaccine. In 2015, along with the Grant agreement (the “Grant Agreement”), we concurrently entered into a Global Access Commitments Agreement with BMGF, under which we agreed to make a certain amount of the RSV F Vaccine available and accessible at affordable pricing to people in certain low and middle income countries.

Phase 2 Safety and Immunogenicity Trial (Completed)
 
In September 2015, we announced positive top-line data from our Phase 2 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in 50 healthy pregnant women and their infants. This clinical trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of our RSV F Vaccine in pregnant women in their third trimester, and assessed the transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies induced by the vaccine. The trial also examined the impact of maternal immunization on infant safety during the first year of life and RSV-specific antibody levels through the infants’ first six months of life. Immunized women demonstrated a geometric mean 14-fold rise in anti-F IgG, a 29-fold rise in palivizumab-competing antibodies and 2.7 and 2.1-fold rises in microneutralization titers against RSV/A and RSV/B, respectively. In contrast, women who received placebo demonstrated no significant change in antibody levels. The infants’ antibody levels at delivery averaged 90-100% of the mothers’ levels, indicating efficient transplacental transfer of antibodies from mother to infant. The estimated half-lives of infant PCA, anti-F IgG, and RSV/A and RSV/B microneutralizing antibodies, based on data through day 60, were 41, 30, 36 and 34 days, respectively.
Fast Track Designation
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted Fast Track designation to our RSV F Vaccine for protection of infants via maternal immunization. Fast Track designation is intended for products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such diseases or conditions. The program is designed to facilitate development and expedite review of drugs to treat serious and life-threatening conditions so that approved products can reach the market expeditiously.
RSV Older Adults Program
 
Burden of Disease
 
Older adults (60 years of age and older) are at increased risk for RSV disease due to immunosenescence, the age-related decline in the human immune system. In this population, RSV is an important respiratory virus, distinct from influenza, which is frequently responsible for serious lower respiratory tract disease and may lead to hospitalization or even death. Additionally, RSV infection can lead to exacerbation of underlying co-morbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”), asthma and congestive heart failure. In the U.S., the incidence rate is approximately 2.5 million infections per year, and RSV is increasingly recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the population of 64 million older adults.11,12 Based on our analysis of published literature applied to 2014 U.S. population estimates, the disease causes 207,000 hospitalizations and 16,000 deaths among adults older than 65.13,14 Annually, we estimate that there are approximately 900,000 medical interventions directly caused by RSV disease across all populations.15,16

Clinical Trial Updates and Analyses
 
Phase 2 (E-205) Safety and Immunogenicity Clinical Trial (Completed)
 
In July 2017, we announced positive top-line data from our Phase 2 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in older adults known as E-205. The objective of the E-205 trial was to assess safety and immunogenicity to one and two dose regimens of the RSV F Vaccine, with and without aluminum phosphate or our proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant, in older adults. The trial was a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial which enrolled 300 older adults in the Southern Hemisphere. Participants were enrolled and vaccinated outside of the RSV season to best assess immunogenicity. Immunogenicity results indicated both aluminum phosphate and Matrix-M adjuvants increased the magnitude, duration and quality of the immune response relative to RSV F antigen alone. All formulations and regimens were safe and well-tolerated. The data support the inclusion of adjuvanted formulations of our RSV F Vaccine in future older adult trials, although we do not currently expect to initiate such trials in 2018 without additional funding.
Further Analyses of Prior Clinical Trials
 
Following the September 2016 announcement of top-line results of Resolve™, our Phase 3 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in older adults conducted during the 2015-16 RSV season in the U.S., we conducted multiple analyses on the clinical data from the Resolve trial, as well as the other completed Phase 2 clinical trials conducted in older adults. Our analyses of these clinical trials sought to better understand their results. More detailed descriptions of each of these RSV older adult clinical trials are found under “Clinical Trial Updates and Analyses” below; the trials are named and briefly described in the following table:

Clinical Trial Name | Phase | Description | Conducted | Participants(#)
--------------------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------+----------------
E-201 | Phase 2 | Efficacy in prevention of all symptomatic RSV disease | 2014-15 RSV season | 1,600 
Resolve (or E-301) | Phase 3 | Efficacy in prevention of msLRTD | 2015-16 RSV season | 11,856 
E-202 Rollover | Phase 2 | Immunogenicity in response to serial immunization after E-201 | 2015-16 RSV season | 1,329 
E-205 | Phase 2 | Immunogenicity in one or two doses, with or without adjuvant | 2017 | 300 

 
We have found that seasonal variation in attack rate, meaning the incidence of infectious disease in an at-risk population, may have a large impact on demonstrating vaccine efficacy in a particular year. Lower attack rates may mean that either the virus is less common in a given season, or alternatively, that the population being studied has increased intrinsic resistance in that season due to a variety of potential factors such as recent prior exposure. In our E-201 trial, we witnessed a high attack rate and showed a clear demonstration of efficacy. In our Resolve trial the following year, we observed a primary endpoint attack rate of only one-fourth that of the previous season. This scenario represents a conundrum that influenza vaccine developers have experienced for decades: “low attack rate” influenza seasons make it very difficult to demonstrate vaccine efficacy.
 
Additional further analyses of the Resolve trial data indicate that our RSV F Vaccine was associated with a 61% reduction in hospitalizations due to COPD exacerbations, and the same analysis of the E-201 trial showed a similar signal, supporting this finding. We believe that such higher-risk patients represent an unmet medical need with a significant healthcare cost burden that could potentially be addressed by such a vaccine.
 
Resolve (E-301) Phase 3 Trial (Completed)
 
In September 2016, we announced top-line data from our Resolve trial. Resolve was a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that began in November 2015, and was fully enrolled with 11,856 older adults at 60 sites in the U.S. by December 2015. The trial did not meet its pre-specified primary or secondary efficacy objectives and did not demonstrate vaccine efficacy. The primary objective of the Resolve trial was to demonstrate efficacy in the prevention of moderate-severe RSV (“msLRTD”), as defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms. The secondary objective of the trial was to demonstrate efficacy of the RSV F Vaccine in reducing the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory disease due to RSV ARD. The trial also evaluated the safety of an unadjuvanted, 135 microgram dose of the RSV F Vaccine compared to placebo. Consistent with our previous clinical experience, the vaccine was well-tolerated.

Phase 2 (E-202) Rollover Trial (Completed)
 
In September 2016, we announced positive top-line data from our E-202 rollover trial of our RSV F Vaccine in older adults. The trial was a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled rollover trial, which enrolled 1,329 older adults from our prior E-201 trial, conducted at the same 10 sites in the U.S. as the E-201 trial. The primary objectives of the trial were to evaluate safety and serum anti-F IgG antibody concentrations in response to immunization with the RSV F Vaccine. The exploratory objectives of the trial evaluated the efficacy of a second annual dose of the RSV F Vaccine in the prevention of RSV ARD and RSV msLRTD. Participants previously randomized to receive 135 microgram RSV F Vaccine or placebo were re-enrolled and re-randomized to receive either 135 microgram RSV F Vaccine or placebo. This trial design resulted in four separate trial arms: a) participants receiving a placebo in both the first trial and second trial (“Placebo-Placebo”); b) participants receiving RSV F Vaccine in the first trial and placebo in the second trial (“Vaccine-Placebo”); c) participants receiving placebo in the first trial and RSV F Vaccine in the second trial (“Placebo-Vaccine”); and d) participants receiving RSV F Vaccine in both the first trial and second trial (“Vaccine-Vaccine”).
 
The E-202 rollover trial demonstrated immunogenicity in all active vaccine recipients, with a 6-fold increase in anti-F IgG in the Placebo-Vaccine arm, consistent with the E-201 trial. There was higher anti-F IgG at baseline in the Vaccine-Vaccine arm compared to the Placebo-Vaccine arm and the Vaccine-Vaccine arm showed a greater than 2-fold increase in anti-F IgG from the higher baseline.
 
Phase 2 (E-201) Trial in Older Adults (Completed)
 
In August 2015, we announced positive top-line data from our E-201 trial of our RSV F Vaccine in 1,600 older adults. The E-201 trial was designed to prospectively examine the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory illnesses associated with RSV infection, in community-living older adults who were treated with placebo. The trial also evaluated safety and immunogenicity of our RSV F Vaccine compared to placebo. Finally, the trial estimated the efficacy of our RSV F Vaccine in reducing the incidence of respiratory illness due to RSV. The trial was the first to demonstrate efficacy of an active RSV immunization in any clinical trial population. In the per protocol population, the clinical trial showed statistically significant vaccine efficacy in prevention of all symptomatic RSV disease (41%) and, in an ad hoc analysis, showed a decrease in RSV disease with any symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (45%) in older adults. The clinical trial established an attack rate for symptomatic RSV disease of 4.9% in older adults, 95% of which included lower respiratory track symptoms. Efficacy against more severe RSV illness, defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms or signs associated with difficulty breathing, was 64% in ad hoc analyses.
RSV Pediatrics Program
 
Burden of Disease
 
There are currently approximately 18 million children in the U.S. between six months and five years of age.17 By the age of five, essentially all children will have been exposed to RSV and will likely have developed natural immunity against the virus, thus decreasing the rate of severe disease in these children. In the U.S., RSV is responsible for approximately 57,000 hospitalizations of children under five years of age annually, the vast majority of which occur in infants less than one year old, and especially those under six months of age.18,19,20,21,22
Clinical Trial Update
 
In September 2015, we announced positive top-line data from our Phase 1 clinical trial of our RSV F Vaccine in healthy children between two and six years of age. This clinical trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of our RSV F Vaccine, with one or two doses, with or without aluminum phosphate adjuvant. Trial enrollment was concluded with a smaller than planned cohort so that dosing could be completed ahead of the 2014-15 RSV season. The vaccine was well-tolerated and serum samples collected from a subset of 18 immunized children in the per-protocol population, demonstrated that the RSV F Vaccine was highly immunogenic at all formulations and regimens. There were greater than 10-fold increases in both anti-F IgG and PCA antibody titers in the adjuvanted group and greater than 6-fold increases in anti-F IgG and PCA antibody titers in the unadjuvanted group. Development of our RSV F Vaccine for pediatrics would likely follow successful development of our RSV F Vaccine for maternal immunization.

Influenza
 
Burden of Disease
 
Influenza is a world-wide infectious disease that causes illness in humans ranging from mild to life-threatening symptoms or even death. Serious illness occurs not only in susceptible populations such as pediatrics and older adults, but also in the general population largely because of infection by unique strains of influenza for which most humans have not developed protective antibodies. Current estimates for seasonal influenza vaccine growth in the top seven markets (U.S., Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK), show a potential increase from approximately $3.2 billion in the 2012-13 season to $5.3 billion by the 2021-22 season.23
 
The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) recommends that all persons aged six months and older be vaccinated annually against seasonal influenza. Influenza is a major burden on public health worldwide: an estimated one million deaths each year are attributed to influenza.24 It is further estimated that, each year, influenza attacks between 5% and 10% of adults and 20% to 30% of children, causing significant levels of illness, hospitalization and death.25 One important advantage of recombinant seasonal influenza vaccines, like the candidate we are developing, is that once licensed for commercial sale, large quantities of such vaccine could potentially be manufactured quickly and in a cost-effective manner, without the use of either live influenza virus or eggs. Our recombinant influenza nanoparticles also can display conserved antigenic regions, which have the potential to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies that appear to protect against a range of “drifted” strains, or influenza strains in which, over time, the hemagglutinin antigen undergoes an accumulation of genetic mutations at the hemagglutinin antigen sites that bind with neutralizing antibodies, potentially resulting in reduced protection of those antibodies. Additionally, nanoparticles offer improved purity and manufacturability and advantages for co-formulation with other nanoparticle-based vaccines.
 
Clinical Trial Update
 
In February 2018, we reported positive top-line results from our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of our nanoparticle seasonal influenza vaccine candidate, including our proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant (“NanoFlu™ vaccine”), in older adults that was initiated in September 2017. The trial was a randomized, observer-blinded, active comparator-controlled trial in approximately 330 healthy older adults. The primary objective of the trial was to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two concentrations (15 micrograms or 60 micrograms) of NanoFlu vaccine compared to the leading licensed egg-based, high-dose influenza vaccine for older adults (“IIV3-HD”). Key findings from the trial include that Nanoflu vaccine induced:

• | Significantly higher hemagglutination inhibition (“HAI”) antibody responses against homologous H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses and comparable HAI responses against the homologous B/Brisbane strain;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Significantly higher HAI immune responses against historic and forward-drifted H3N2 virus strains; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong neutralizing antibody responses that correlate with HAI results.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Overall, NanoFlu vaccine was well-tolerated over the three-week trial period. Given the strength of these trial results, we have submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal and/or for presentation at an upcoming scientific meeting. Based on these results, we expect to begin a Phase 2 trial of our NanoFlu vaccine in the third quarter of 2018.

Preclinical Analyses
 
Preclinical data in which NanoFlu was compared in a head-to-head challenge study against IIV3-HD, as well as IIV3-SD (standard dose) seasonal influenza vaccine, was announced in August 2017 and provided a strong rationale for the initiation of the Phase 1/2 trial. Our NanoFlu vaccine demonstrated significantly stronger and broader immune responses (microneutralizing antibodies) against homologous and heterologous influenza strains, including a series of drifted H3N2 strains evolved across over more than a decade of influenza seasons. In this preclinical challenge study, we showed that our NanoFlu vaccine was more protective than the licensed comparator vaccines against both a homologous H3N2 virus and a ten-year old drifted H3N2 strain. In parallel, we announced the achievement of significant improvements in manufacturing yields and product purity.
Emerging Viruses
 
Ebola Virus
 
EBOV, formerly known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. Multiple strains of EBOV have been identified, the most recent of which, the Makona EBOV strain, is associated with a case fatality rate of 50% to 90%.26 There are currently no licensed treatments proven to neutralize the virus, but a range of blood, immunological and drug therapies are under development. Despite the development of such therapies, current vaccine approaches target either a previous strain of the virus or were initially developed to be delivered by genetic vectors. In contrast, our EBOV glycoprotein vaccine candidate (“Ebola GP Vaccine”) was developed using the Makona EBOV strain.
 
In July 2015, we announced positive top-line data from our Phase 1 clinical trial of our Ebola GP Vaccine in ascending doses, with and without our Matrix-M adjuvant, in 230 healthy adults. Participants received either one or two intramuscular injections ranging from 6.5 micrograms to 50 micrograms of antigen, with or without adjuvant, or placebo. Immunogenicity was assessed at multiple time points, including days 28 and 35. These Phase 1 data demonstrated that our Ebola GP Vaccine is highly immunogenic, well-tolerated and, in conjunction with our proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant, resulted in significant antigen dose-sparing. The adjuvanted Ebola GP Vaccine was highly immunogenic at all dose levels; the adjuvanted two-dose regimens induced Ebola anti-GP antibody geometric mean responses between 45,000 and 70,000 ELISA units, representing a 500 to 750-fold rise over baseline at day 35. In 2015, we also announced successful data from two separate non-human primate challenge studies of our Ebola GP Vaccine in which, in both cases, the challenge was lethal for the control animal, whereas 100% of the immunized animals were protected.
 
Zika Virus
 
We initiated development of a vaccine against the Zika virus (“ZIKV”) in response to the unmet global medical need for a response to this serious disease. The subsequent evolving epidemiology of ZIKV, which saw significant reductions in cases both in the U.S. and around the world in 2017, along with the uncertainty of governmental and non-governmental organization funding, has caused us to suspend these development efforts in lieu of competing resources and corporate priorities around more promising product development.
Combination Respiratory Vaccine
 
Given the ongoing development of our RSV F Vaccine and our desire to develop a combination respiratory vaccine with the potential to protect against both RSV and seasonal influenza, we made the decision to shift our seasonal influenza vaccine development focus from VLP-based seasonal influenza vaccines to nanoparticle-based seasonal influenza vaccines. We remain confident that a combination nanoparticle vaccine against both RSV and influenza is feasible.

CPLB Joint Venture (India)
 
CPL Biologicals Private Limited (“CPLB”), our joint venture company with Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited (“Cadila”) in India, is actively developing a number of vaccine candidates that were genetically engineered by us. CPLB is owned 20% by us and 80% by Cadila. CPLB operates a manufacturing facility in India for the production of vaccines.
Seasonal Influenza
 
Since 2016, CPLB has been marketing CadiFlu-S, its trivalent VLP influenza vaccine in India, with limited sales in 2017 and expected in 2018.
 
Rabies
 
In October 2016, CPLB initiated its Phase 3 clinical trial in India of a recombinant rabies G protein vaccine candidate that can be administered in prophylactic regimens, both pre and post-exposure. The post-exposure regimen has the potential to use fewer doses (three doses) than the current standard of care (five doses). Data from the trial are expected in 2018.
Vaccine Technology
 
Our recombinant protein nanoparticle vaccine technology is based on self-assembly of surface protein antigens from pathogenic organisms including viruses, bacteria or parasites. The conformations of these nanoparticles are similar but not identical to the natural structure of surface antigens of disease organisms, and lack the genetic material required for replication and therefore are not infectious. Potential immunological advantages of protein nanoparticles may be associated with the nanoparticle conformation and the presentation of key functional epitopes that are often immunologically hidden in the native pathogen. This leads to efficient recognition by the immune system’s antigen presenting cells that trigger robust immune responses. Recognition of the nanoparticle vaccine’s repeating protein patterns by the antigen presenting cells’ toll-like receptors to stimulate innate immunity and the high purity and lack of synthetic material adds to the potential safety of recombinant nanoparticle vaccines. Protein nanoparticle vaccine technology has expanded our early-stage vaccines in development to include both virus and non-virus disease targets. Our most advanced protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate is our RSV F Vaccine, which self-assembles from our highly purified F-protein antigen.
Matrix Adjuvants
 
Adjuvants are predominantly used to enable a vaccine to increase the amplitude of the immune response and qualitatively change it, broaden its specificity to provide protection against related microorganisms and allow for effective immunization with much lower doses of antigen. Novavax AB has developed a number of adjuvant formulations, all based on our proprietary Matrix™ technology. These adjuvant formulations possess excellent immunostimulatory features with the ability to increase and prolong the protective benefits of vaccines.
 
While adjuvants based on novel, poorly characterized substances have been hampered by safety concerns and limited efficacy, Matrix adjuvants stimulate strong antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. Matrix adjuvants may allow for lower antigen doses, longer-duration immune responses and carry a lower risk for allergic reactions or other adverse events. Our Matrix technology typically induces strong cellular activation of both Th1 and Th2 types, thereby generating all classes and subclasses of antibodies, as well as potent cellular responses, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Our Matrix-M adjuvant provides a potent adjuvant effect that has been well-tolerated in clinical trials. We also believe that the strong immune response and opportunity to reduce the quantity of antigen dose can significantly reduce the production cost of our vaccines. This means that our Matrix-M adjuvant has the potential to be of significant value when there is inadequate vaccine manufacturing capacity during an emerging disease threat such as an influenza pandemic.
 
Competition in RSV, EBOV, Influenza and Other Vaccines
 
The vaccine market is intensely competitive, characterized by rapid technological progress. Our technology is based upon utilizing the baculovirus expression system in insect cells to make recombinant vaccines. We believe this system offers many advantages when compared to other technologies and is uniquely well-suited for developing RSV and influenza vaccines, as well as vaccines against a number of other infectious diseases.

There is currently no approved RSV vaccine for sale in the world; however, a number of vaccine manufacturers, academic institutions and other organizations currently have, or have had, programs to develop such a vaccine. In addition, many other companies are developing products to prevent disease caused by RSV using a variety of technology platforms, including various viral vector technologies, monoclonal antibodies (Mab), and competitive recombinant technologies. We believe that our RSV vaccine candidate, utilizing a recombinant F-protein antigen, is more effective than RSV vaccine candidates in development by our competitors; however, such efficaciousness cannot be guaranteed. Although we are not aware of all our competitors’ efforts, we believe that MedImmune, LLC (“MedImmune”), a subsidiary of AstraZeneca PLC, may have the second most advanced RSV vaccine program after Novavax, as it has reported testing in Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 clinical trials of an intranasal, recombinant, live attenuated, RSV vaccine for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV, as well as a combination intranasal vaccine for the prevention of several infant respiratory illnesses, including RSV. In older adults, MedImmune also conducted a Phase 2 trial of MEDI-7510 (recombinant F subunit with an adjuvant administered intramuscularly). In both MedImmune vaccine programs, the trials did not report complete success. Another approach by MedImmune (partnered with Sanofi) is passive immunity as provided by MEDI-8897 (an RSV monoclonal antibody) and is currently in Phase 2 trials for preterm infants. A similar Mab from Regeneron (REGN-2222) failed a Phase 3 trial in preterm infants, and its development has since been discontinued. Additional entities have also entered into early clinical trials including GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, Bavarian Nordic, J&J/Crucell, Ablynx, Immunovaccine, Mucosis, Vaxart and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, an institute under the U.S. National Institutes of Health (“NIAID”).
 
There are a number of companies developing and selling vaccines for seasonal influenza employing both traditional (egg-based) and new vaccine technologies (cell-based). Many seasonal influenza vaccines are currently approved and marketed, and most of these are marketed by major pharmaceutical companies that have significantly greater financial and technical resources, experience and expertise. Competition in the sale of seasonal influenza vaccines is intense. Therefore, newly developed and approved products must be differentiated from existing vaccines in order to have commercial success. In order to show differentiation in the seasonal influenza market, a product may need to be more efficacious and/or be less expensive and quicker to manufacture. Many of our competitors are working on new products and new generations of current products, some by adding an adjuvant that is used to increase the immunogenicity of that product, each of which is intended to be more efficacious than currently marketed products. Another differentiating factor is recombinant manufacturing, which we believe can be quicker and less-expensive than traditional egg-based manufacturing. Despite the significant competition and advancing technologies, some of which are similar to our own, we believe that our nanoparticle seasonal influenza product, NanoFlu™ vaccine, could be as efficacious as, or more so than, current products or products being developed by our competitors, and that our manufacturing system provides savings in both time and money; however, there can be no guarantee that our seasonal influenza vaccine will prove to be efficacious or that our manufacturing system will prove to be sufficiently effective and differentiated to ensure commercial success.
 
Vaccine candidates against EBOV have been in development for more than a decade; however, with the recent epidemic in West Africa (now subsided), focus on viable vaccine candidates has intensified. The WHO has reported two vaccine candidates that are currently being tested in humans: one by GlaxoSmithKline in collaboration with NIAID, and the other by a collaboration of NewLink Genetics, Merck Vaccines USA (“Merck”) and the Public Health Agency of Canada. The Merck vaccine is the only one to have completed some human trials before the epidemic faded, to have had data published, and to now be planning to file for licensure. While these and other vaccine candidates offer promise, we believe there are accompanying challenges, including: high-dose level requirements; utilization of glycoprotein from older strains that have a significant number of amino acid changes when compared to the 2014 Makona strain; difficult storage requirements at temperatures below –60°C; and challenges associated with immunity to the viral vectors, which could limit their multi-dose vaccine potential. In contrast, we have developed a Phase 1 vaccine candidate that has performed well with low doses utilizing our Matrix-M adjuvant, was derived from the 2014 Makona strain, appears to be stable at 2–8°C and appears to provide enhanced immunogenicity as a multi-dose vaccine.
 
In general, competition among pharmaceutical products is based in part on product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price and patent position. An important factor is the relative timing of the market introduction of our products and our competitors’ products. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is an important competitive factor. Our competitive position also may depend upon our ability to show differentiation with a product that is more efficacious and/or less expensive and quicker to manufacture. Other factors affecting our competitive position include our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the lengthy period between technological conception and commercial sale.

Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
We generally seek patent protection for our technology and product candidates in the U.S. and abroad. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Our success will depend, in part, on whether we can:

· | obtain patents to protect our own technologies and product candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtain licenses to use the technologies of third-parties, which may be protected by patents;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | protect our trade secrets and know-how; and
--+--------------------------------------------


· | operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patent Rights; Licenses.
 
We have intellectual property (patents, licenses, know-how) related to our vaccines, manufacturing processes and other technologies. Currently, we have or have rights to over 250 U.S. patents and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications relating to vaccines and vaccine-related technologies.
 
Since 2007, we have maintained a non-exclusive license arrangement with Wyeth Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. (Wyeth), to a family of patents and patent applications covering VLP technology for use in human vaccines in certain fields, with expected patent expiration in early 2022.
 
Patents related to our VLP program include U.S. Patent No. 7,763,450, which covers, in part, the use of influenza gene sequences for high-yield production of consistent influenza VLP vaccines to protect against current and future seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza viruses. Corresponding European patent, European Patent No. 1644037 also covers this technology. U.S. Patent Nos. 8,080,255, 8,551,756, 8,506,967 and 8,592,197 are directed to methods of producing VLPs and inducing substantial immunity to an influenza virus infection by administering VLPs comprising HA and NA proteins, and our M1 protein derived from the avian influenza strain, A/Indonesia/5/05. Certain claims also encompass similar methods and compositions where the M1 protein is from a different strain of influenza virus than the influenza HA protein and the influenza NA protein. Related patent protection in Europe is provided by European Patent No. 2343084, which covers, in part, vaccine compositions containing VLPs that contain M1, HA, and NA proteins. Our VLP patent portfolio contains many other patents, including U.S. Patent Nos. 8,951,537, 8,992,939, 9,144,607, 9,050,290, 9,180,180, 9,381,239, 9,464,276, 9,474,799, and other patents in multiple ex-U.S. jurisdictions, and we continue to prosecute patents related to this program.
 
In addition to our VLP program, we have issued patents and pending applications directed to other programs, including our RSV and rabies programs. Issued patents directed to various aspects of the RSV program include U.S. Patent Nos. 8,715,692, 9,675,685, 9,731,000, and 9,717,786. Additional patents in the family include EP237009 in Europe, as well as others throughout the world. Patents related to our rabies program include 9,724,405 in the U.S. and EP2635257 in Europe. Related patents have been issued in other world markets. In addition to our focus on vaccine programs, we also pursue patent protection for our Matrix Adjuvant program. Issued U.S. Patent Nos. 7,838,019, 9,205,147, and 8,821,881 provide examples of patents related to our Matrix Adjuvant program.
 
We continue to prepare, file, and prosecute patent applications to provide broad and strong protection of our proprietary rights, including next generation applications focused on our RSV Program, our influenza nanoparticle program, and our adjuvant program.
 
The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and related statutory guidance encourages the dissemination of science and technology innovation. While our expired contract with the Department of Health and Human Services, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority provided us with the right to retain ownership in our inventions that may have arisen during performance of that contract, with respect to certain other collaborative research efforts with the U.S. government, certain developments and results that may have commercial potential are to be freely published, not treated as confidential, and we may be required to negotiate a license to developments and results in order to commercialize products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully obtain any such license at a reasonable cost, or that such development and results will not be made available to our competitors on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis.

Trade Secrets.
 
We also rely significantly on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. It is our policy to require employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, collaborators and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, consulting or collaborative relationships with us. We also require confidentiality agreements from any entity that is to receive confidential information from us. With respect to employees, consultants and contractors, the agreements generally provide that all inventions made by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as our property.
Government Regulations
 
The development, production and marketing of biological products, which include the vaccine candidates being developed by Novavax or our collaborators, are subject to regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. As a U.S. based company, we focus on the U.S. regulatory process and the standards imposed by the FDA, the International Conference on Harmonisation (“ICH”) and other agencies because we believe, for the most part, meeting U.S. and ICH standards will allow us to satisfy regulatory agencies in other countries where we intend to do business. We are aware that expectations in some venues, notably in the European Union, differ to some degree and we are taking proactive steps to address such differences. In the U.S., the development, manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceuticals and vaccines are subject to extensive regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and biological products are subject to regulation under provisions of that act and the Public Health Service Act. The FDA not only assesses the safety and efficacy of these products but it also regulates, among other things, the testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion of such products. The process of obtaining FDA licensure for a new vaccine is costly and time-consuming.
 
Vaccine clinical development follows the same general regulatory pathway as drugs and other biologics. Before applying for FDA licensure to market any new vaccine candidate, we expect to first submit an investigational new drug application (“IND”) that explains to the FDA, among other things, the results of preclinical toxicology testing conducted in laboratory animals, the method of manufacture, quality control tests for release, the stability of the investigational product and what we propose to do for human testing. At this stage, the FDA decides whether it is reasonably safe to move forward with testing the vaccine candidate in humans. We must then conduct Phase 1 clinical trials and larger-scale Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials that demonstrate the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of our vaccine candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. Once these trials are complete, a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) can be submitted to the FDA requesting licensure of the vaccine for marketing based on the vaccine’s safety and efficacy.
 
The FDA will only approve a BLA if the vaccine is demonstrated to be safe, pure, and potent. During the FDA’s review of a BLA, the proposed manufacturing facility undergoes a pre-approval inspection during which the FDA examines in detail the production of the vaccine, the manufacturing facility and the quality documentation related to the vaccine. Vaccine licensure also requires the provision of adequate product labeling to allow health care providers to understand the vaccine’s proper use, including its potential benefits and risks, to communicate with patients and parents, and to safely deliver the vaccine to the public. Until a vaccine is given to the general population, all potential adverse events cannot be anticipated. Thus, the FDA typically requires Phase 4 post-marketing clinical trials for vaccines after licensure to continue gathering safety, and sometimes effectiveness/efficacy data in the indicated and additional populations.
 
In order to ensure continuing safety, the FDA continues to oversee the production of vaccines even after the vaccine and manufacturing processes are approved. For example, monitoring of the vaccine and of production activities, including periodic facility inspections, must continue as long as the manufacturer holds a license for the product. Manufacturers may also be required to submit to the FDA the results of their own tests for potency, safety and purity for each vaccine lot, if requested by the FDA. They may also be required to submit samples of each vaccine lot to the FDA for testing.

In addition to obtaining FDA licensure for each product, each domestic manufacturing establishment must be registered with the FDA, is subject to FDA inspection and must comply with cGMP regulations. To supply products for use either in the U.S. or outside the U.S., including clinical trials, U.S. and foreign manufacturing establishments, including third-party facilities, must comply with GMP regulations and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA or by corresponding regulatory agencies in their home country.
 
In 1992, the FDA instituted regulations that allow accelerated approval of certain products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments based on a surrogate endpoint, versus a clinical outcome, which can take many more years to demonstrate. Surrogate endpoints, generally a laboratory measurement or other physical sign shown to have some correlation with clinical benefit, can considerably shorten the development time leading up to FDA licensure. The FDA bases its decision on whether to accept a proposed surrogate endpoint on the scientific support for that endpoint. The company developing the product is required to conduct further studies to confirm the clinical benefit in Phase 4 confirmatory efficacy trials. We plan to seek accelerated approval for our seasonal influenza vaccine for older adults, but have not ruled out the potential use of traditional approval.
 
In addition to regulatory approvals that must be obtained in the U.S., an investigational product is also subject to regulatory approval in other countries in which it is intended to be marketed. No such product can be marketed in a country until the regulatory authorities of that country have approved an appropriate marketing application. FDA licensure does not assure approval by other regulatory authorities. In addition, in many countries, the government is involved in the pricing of the product. In such cases, the pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted.
 
We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations, including national and local regulations that govern our facility in Sweden. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by our operations. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. Additionally, for formulations containing controlled substances, we are subject to Drug Enforcement Act regulations.
 
In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities or programs, private health insurers (including managed care plans) and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Third-party payors may also control access to, or manage utilization of, our products with various utilization management techniques.
 
Within the U.S., if we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our product candidates, those products could potentially be covered by various government health benefit programs as well as purchased by government agencies. The participation in such programs or the sale of products to such agencies is subject to regulation. In exchange for coverage, we may be obligated to provide rebates or offer discounts under government health programs or to government and private purchasers.
 
The U.S. and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (“Healthcare Reform Act”) which includes changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government health care programs. Under the Trump administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act, and some modifications have been implemented. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny in the U.S. of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been several recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices or price increases. Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our product candidates if approved for sale. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.

Within the U.S., we may be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, for activities related to future sales of any of our product candidates that may in the future receive regulatory and marketing approval. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a pharmaceutical manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase, prescription or use of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under such anti-kickback laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent.
 
Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers with marketed products. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers and/or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, any future activities (if we obtain approval and/or reimbursement from federal healthcare programs for our product candidates) could be subject to challenge.
 
Manufacturing
 
Our primary manufacturing facility is located at our corporate headquarters at 20 Firstfield Road in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The facility has 53,000 square feet of combined GMP manufacturing and laboratory space. Our Rockville, Maryland facility houses our 10,000 square foot GMP pilot manufacturing facility that produces early-stage clinical trial material. Novavax AB, located in Uppsala, Sweden, produces our Matrix adjuvants in an approximately 24,000 square foot facility comprised of GMP manufacturing, laboratory and office space.
Sources of Supply
 
Most of the raw materials and other supplies required in our business are generally available from established vendors in quantities adequate to meet our needs. In some cases, we have only qualified one vendor for certain of our manufacturing components. Prior to the initiation of commercial production, we plan, where feasible, to qualify multiple vendors of critical raw materials. One key vendor is GE Healthcare Company (“GEHC”), which supplies disposable components, resins, media and buffers used in our manufacturing process. GEHC and other vendors that supply our key manufacturing materials have been or will be audited for compliance with GMP standards.
 
An important component of our Matrix adjuvant technology is extracted from a species of soap-bark tree (Quillaja saponaria) that grows mainly in Chile, and we have been able to acquire high-quality quillaja extract as needed from our current suppliers.
 
Business Development
 
We believe our proprietary vaccine technology affords us a range of traditional and non-traditional commercialization options that are broader than those of existing vaccine companies. We strive to create sustainable value by working to obtain non-dilutive funding, similar to our agreement with BMGF to fund our RSV program, that would allow for:

• | continued development of our vaccine candidates until such vaccines can be licensed;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | retained commercial rights in one or more major markets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | product sales revenue; and
--+---------------------------


• | in certain markets, commercialized products through partners and other strategic relationships.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to our aforementioned agreement with BMGF, another example of a strategic relationship is our joint venture we established with Cadila. CPLB is owned 20% by us and 80% by Cadila. It was established in 2009 to develop and manufacture certain vaccine candidates, biogeneric products and diagnostic products for the territory of India. CPLB operates a manufacturing facility in India for the production of vaccines and is actively developing a number of vaccine candidates that were genetically engineered by us.
 
Employees
 
As of March 9, 2018, we have 347 full-time employees, of whom 61 hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees and 100 of whom hold other advanced degrees. Of our total workforce, 300 are engaged primarily in research, development and manufacturing activities and 47 are engaged primarily in executive, business development, finance and accounting, legal and administrative functions. None of our U.S. employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements; 33 of our 34 Swedish employees are covered by typical collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
