Our integrated suite of software optimizes design performance across multiple disciplines encompassing structures, motion, fluids, thermal management, electromagnetics, system modeling, and embedded systems, while also providing data analytics and true-to-life visualization and rendering. 
 We believe a critical component of our success has been our company culture, based on our core values of innovation, envisioning the future, communicating honestly and broadly, seeking technology and business firsts, and embracing diversity. This culture is important because it helps attract and retain top people, encourages innovation and teamwork, and enhances our focus on achieving Altairs corporate objectives. 
 Products 
 Our software enables customers to enhance product performance, compress development time, and reduce costs. Our thirty-year heritage is in solving some of the most challenging design problems faced by engineers and scientists. Altair is also a leading provider of high performance computing, or HPC, workflow tools which empower our customers to explore designs in ways not possible in traditional computing environments. We believe we are unique in the industry for the depth and breadth of our engineering application software offerings combined with our domain expertise and proprietary technology for harnessing HPC and cloud infrastructures. 
 Our primary users are highly educated and technical engineers, commonly referred to as simulation specialists. We predominantly reach customers with simulation specialists through Altairs experienced, direct sales force, especially in industries requiring highly engineered products, such as automotive, aerospace, heavy machinery, rail and ship design. To enable concept engineering driven by simulation we make our physics solvers more accessible to designers, who may be less technical and not expert in simulation, by wrapping them in powerful, yet simple interfaces. We are increasing our use of indirect channels to more efficiently address a broader set of customers in consumer products, electronics, energy and other industries. 
 Altair pioneered a patented units-based subscription licensing model for software and other digital content. This units-based subscription licensing model allows flexible and shared access to all of our offerings, along with over 150 partner products. Our customers license a pool of units for their organizations giving individual users access to our entire portfolio of software applications as well as our growing portfolio of partner products. We believe our units-based subscription licensing model lowers barriers to adoption, creates broad engagement, encourages users to work within our ecosystem, and increases revenue. This, in turn, helps drive our recurring software license rate which has been on average approximately 88% over the past five years. Each year approximately 60% of new software revenue comes from expansion within existing customers.

Solvers & optimization 
 Solvers are mathematical software engines that use advanced computational algorithms to predict physical performance. Optimization leverages solvers to derive the most efficient solutions to meet desired complex multi-objective requirements. 
 Altairs solvers are a comprehensive set of fast, scalable and reliable physics solvers that can solve complex problems in linear and non-linear mechanics, fluid dynamics, electromagnetics, motion, systems and manufacturing simulation. 
 Altairs optimization technology is a key differentiator and spans our product offering. Our focus on optimization combined with multiphysics and multi-domain simulation has changed product development, and we believe customers using our technologies can gain a sustainable competitive advantage by developing better products in less time. 
 Modeling & visualization 
 Modeling & visualization tools allow for advanced physics attributes to be modeled and rendered on top of object geometry in high fidelity. These tools are becoming more design-centric and relevant earlier in the development process. 
 Industrial & concept design 
 Industrial & concept design tools that generate early concepts to address requirements for ergonomics, aesthetics, performance, and manufacturing feasibility. These tools are simulation-driven and, we believe, emerging as a market force eclipsing traditional computer-aided design, or CAD. 
 Internet of Things 
 Tools to develop new Internet of Things, or IoT, enabled products, including device and data management, system level and full three dimensional, or 3D, digital twin simulation, and exploration, predictive analysis, optimization, and visualization of in-service performance. We expect our tools for multidisciplinary simulation and development to become increasingly important for product design. Our software is used to design and optimize IoT devices and connectivity, and for modeling in-service product performance. 
 We believe Altairs math and systems solutions are unique for their openness, usability, and ability to provide signal-based and physical modeling from 0D to 3D all within our units-based subscription licensing model. A truly simulation-driven design process means that simulation models support decision making in each stage of the product development process. To support this, models need to be multidisciplinary and may include mechanics, electrical and electronics, and software among other technical elements, and must encompass a scope of products ranging from components to IoT-enabled systems of systems. Varying degrees of fidelity aid the process where computational requirements or data availability might otherwise prove to be obstacles. 
 We believe a key strength to Altairs math and systems solutions is allowing development organizations to move seamlessly in this multi-discipline, multi-component, multi-detail space while integrating models from various authoring tools. With a broad range of multi-physics solvers based on an open-system approach, a strong set of model reduction techniques can be employed toward IoT-enabled product development which can then be carried forward into device management and application development on the Carriots platform. 
 High-performance computing 
 HPC software applications designed to streamline the workflow management of compute-intensive tasks including solvers, optimization, modeling, visualization and analytics in fields such as Product Lifecycle Management, or PLM, weather modeling, bio-informatics and electronic design analysis. 
 Altairs HPC offerings support engineers and scientists across a wide range of industries including automotive, aerospace, academia, energy, electronic design automation, defense, and weather. Altair PBS Works is our secure workload management suite to improve HPC performance and reliability in on-premise, cloud, and hybrid environments. 
 Our simulation technology users are moving to ever-larger models to achieve higher-fidelity results for more realistic simulations. As these models are computationally intensive, they require special equipment and cloud access for deeper design exploration and optimization. We believe HPC addresses the performance needs of our users and is critical to companies and research organizations working on complex, simulation-intensive design problems. 
 Altair Partner Alliance 
 The Altair Partner Alliance, or APA, provides access to a broad spectrum of complementary software products using customers existing HyperWorks Units. They can download and use partner product applications on-demand. This constantly growing portfolio extends their simulation and design capabilities to help create better products faster.

Our research and development efforts relating to our software focus on five areas: 
 

 | Solvers & Optimization: Solvers are mathematical software engines that use advanced computational algorithms to simulate physics. Altair initially specialized in structural simulation, and now continuously develops our portfolio of solvers to simulate fluid dynamics, high and low frequency electromagnetics, mechanical systems, electronic controls and more. Altair also invests to couple our solvers to simulate multiple physics domains simultaneously, and is considered a world leader in the development of optimization technology, which drives solvers to find solutions to complex multi-objective design problems. R&D is also conducted to leverage high-performance computing technology for these compute intensive applications. Solver and optimization development is conducted by researchers with advanced degrees in engineering, physics, computer science and mathematics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Modeling & Visualization: The graphical applications used to construct and visualize simulation models require continuous R&D in the areas of data structures, computational methods, graphics, geometric modeling, mesh generation, and user interface design. Altairs modeling tools are becoming more design-centric and are adopting some of the capabilities of traditional CAD while leveraging simulation and optimization technology to drive design decisions rather than just simulate designs. Specific areas of R&D include handling large scale models of highly detailed and complex products, developing new methods to derive design geometry from optimizations, and unifying the modeling environment for multi-physics simulation. Adapting modeling and visualization technology for cloud deployment is also an area of active development as is supporting virtual and augmented reality hardware.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Industrial & Concept Design: Simulation-driven design requires tools to generate early concepts addressing requirements for ergonomics, aesthetics, performance, and manufacturing feasibility. These tools are simulation-driven, and we believe, emerging as a market force eclipsing traditional CAD. We believe Inspire is key to the democratization of simulation capabilities across large groups of designers and engineers who are not simulation specialists. Significant investment continues toward making the Inspire environment capable of providing most early design stage simulation needs. We expect to further integrate the visualization capabilities of Evolve and Thea Render across Altairs product suites. The development teams for Industrial & Concept Design products include deep experience with industrial design processes and manufacturing methods.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | IoT: The Internet of Things requires tools to enable development of products that sense, collect, and communicate information. Our IoT toolsets perform device and data management, system level and full 3D digital twin simulation, and allow exploration, predictive analysis, optimization, and visualization of in-service performance. Carriots, including our cloud data analytics technology, makes our tools for multidisciplinary simulation and development increasingly important for product design and in-service operating data. Designed for visualizing and exploring large data sets, we are currently enhancing Carriots to facilitate deployment of analytics apps by third party developers and linked to IoT stacks.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Compose, Activate, and Embed support product development for the IoT through a math-based programming environment, multidisciplinary system modeling, and control system development and are an important ongoing research and development effort. We support our own high level matrix-based numerical computing language, as well as Python and Tcl, in an interactive programming environment for all types of math operations. We expect to add more language and library support, broaden the math libraries, and integrate these products more deeply with Altairs other software. 
 

 | HPC: Altairs acquisition and development of HPC software complements our compute intensive simulation and optimization technology. While investments continue in the core workload management technology, new areas of R&D include innovative workload simulation and resource optimization, a cloud-based user interface to facilitate the deployment and administration of HPC clusters, and the development of new web-based job submission, monitoring and management tools. The HPC development teams work closely with the modeling and visualization teams and IoT Analytics teams to ensure that Altairs overall technology portfolio interoperates effectively and shares a common infrastructure and user experience.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In order to maintain and extend our technology leadership and competitive position, we intend to continue devoting significant effort to our research and development activities.

Product suites 
 HyperWorks 
 HyperWorks is a suite of software products which primarily targets simulation specialists and some test engineers at large enterprises, and users with deep technical needs at small and medium sized companies. HyperWorks Units, or HWUs, are an embodiment of our patented units-based subscription licensing model, and provide access to all of Altairs more than 30 software products including those available in our solidThinking, Altair PBS Works, and Carriots suites, and all of the more than 150 APA products. 
 HyperWorks represents the majority of Altairs revenue. To sell HyperWorks we primarily engage with our customers through our direct global sales force. Our sales teams interact with key information technology, or IT, decision makers, engage deeply with users of our products by leveraging a team of Altairs technical specialists, and work with user-group managers and executives to ensure they are maximizing the utility of our HyperWorks suite. Resellers of HyperWorks are mainly in APAC and Eastern Europe. They are managed by our direct field offices. 
 solidThinking 
 solidThinking is a more recent suite offering, a subset of our HyperWorks products focused on industrial design, concept engineering, manufacturing feasibility, and model-based design. solidThinking primarily targets designers, engineers and architects at small and medium enterprises. Historically, solidThinking has been offered under a traditional licensing model. We are currently transitioning to a units-based subscription licensing model similar to HyperWorks. 
 solidThinking Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Altair, created to market this suite through resellers who provide sales and first line support for these customers. 
 Altair PBS Works 
 Altair PBS Works is a suite of three products including, Altair PBS Professional, Altair PBS Access, and Altair PBS Cloud, targeting IT professionals, engineers, and scientists at commercial enterprises, universities and research institutes. Altair PBS Works optimizes the use of HPC to design products, predict weather, perform drug discovery research, calculate financial risk, and support other compute intensive work. Altair PBS Works licensing and support is generally on a per node and per user subscription basis. 
 Altair PBS Works is sold by Altairs global strategic sales force with sales overlay support from Altair HPC sales specialists and application engineers. Some major HPC hardware companies bundle Altair PBS Works on new HPC computer systems. We offer Altair PBS Professional as both an open source and a commercial solution. Commercial sites generally license the commercial version along with support. However, many universities, government agencies and small commercial sites prefer the open source version as their work often needs to be freely available for societal benefit. Large government and research installations generally still purchase support and often pay for specific development. 
 In September 2017, the Company acquired Runtime Design Automation, or Runtime. Runtime complements Altairs PBS Works suite of products for comprehensive, secure workload management for HPC and cloud environments and has solutions to manage highly complex workflows. We believe both Runtime and PBS Works deliver innovative and mission critical technology to optimize the use of HPC for compute-intensive applications. PBS Works targets product design, weather prediction, oil exploration and bio-informatics, and Runtime primarily serves customers in Electronic Design Automation, or EDA. 
 Carriots 
 In May 2017, the Company acquired Carriots S.L, or Carriots. Carriots helps customers enable their products to communicate via numerous standard protocols, perform device and data management, visualize and analyze big data, develop applications, and perform digital twin simulations. Carriots is an end-to-end and open architecture IoT platform. It complements Altairs other product suites to provide a comprehensive solution for customers to design and implement IoT enabled products. The solution is designed with Altairs open philosophy to facilitate seamless integration of its platform elements within customer enterprises to share data and communicate with multiple Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP, simulation and communication systems. 
 Carriots is sold by our direct sales force, supported by an overlay team, to customers where we have longstanding relationships as well as to customers in some markets new to Altair. We also sell through resellers and implementation consultants who sell and support Carriots in markets where they are strong. 
 Carriots Analytics is designed to easily embed in other software products to provide analytics capabilities. We work with other software companies to implement Carriots Analytics in their applications focused on vertical domains where these companies have deep experience and customer relationships.

Direct and indirect sales channels 
 Direct sales channels 
 Approximately 90% of our 2017 software revenue was generated through our direct global sales force. Our direct sales force is responsible for developing new customers, ensuring high recurring rates from our existing customers, and expanding the use of Altair and partner products within customers environments through continuous training, support, and consulting engagements. Each of our field sales professionals are supported by technical specialists with deep knowledge of our products and the broader product development domain. We believe this approach differentiates Altair from our competitors, as our focus on establishing a strong working relationship with the user community has led to expanded usage of Altair and partner products. Our direct sales force is organized by geographic regions, consisting of Americas, EMEA, and APAC. 
 Indirect sales channels 
 Approximately 9% of our 2017 software revenue was generated through our growing network of indirect channel partners and resellers. These companies are central to Altairs software sales growth strategy by expanding our market reach to small and medium-sized customers. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 300 reseller and original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, relationships, including over 180 solidThinking resellers, primarily added in the last three years, and over 120 HyperWorks and Altair PBS resellers and OEMs. We are increasing our use of indirect channels in an effort to address a broader set of customers in consumer products, electronics, energy and other industries and expect the share of indirect channel sales to increase in the coming years. 
 To enable concept engineering driven by simulation we make our physics solvers more accessible to designers, who may be less technical and not expert in simulation, by wrapping them in powerful, yet simple interfaces. In addition to being available under the HyperWorks suite, these products are sold through resellers worldwide under the solidThinking brand. 
 solidThinking is sold by over 180 resellers worldwide. The solidThinking resellers in the Americas and EMEA are managed by the solidThinking corporate team, while in APAC these resellers are managed by Altair field offices. This channel is relatively new and beginning to produce meaningful results. 
 We have OEM arrangements for Altair PBS Works with most of the major HPC hardware companies when they sell new computer systems. We believe these arrangements reduce competition, grow our market share and improve sales efficiency. 
 Carriots is sold and supported by resellers and implementation consultants in markets where they are strong and have vertical domain expertise outside of Altairs traditional manufacturing base. In addition to being available under HyperWorks, Carriots Analytics goes to market through OEM and strategic relationships worldwide including third party software companies seeking to embed analytics capabilities into their applications. We have established several key alliances in the utility and smart building controls markets.

In order to continue to drive growth and extend our market position, we intend to continue to invest significant resources into our marketing initiatives. 
 Customers 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had tens of thousands of users across approximately 5,000 customers worldwide. Our customers are primarily large manufacturing enterprises. We have a growing presence in small and mid-size companies and compete in markets beyond manufacturing including Architecture/Engineering/Construction, or AEC, energy, life and earth sciences, and government entities. In 2017, we generated 37%, 32% and 31% of our total billings from customers in the Americas, APAC, and EMEA, respectively. None of our customers accounted for more than 10% of our 2017 billings. Billings consists of our total revenue plus the change in our deferred revenue in a given period and is discussed under Key metrics included in Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Automotive and aerospace combined account for over 50% of our 2017 software billings, including 15 out of 15 of the worlds leading automotive manufacturers and 10 out of 10 of the worlds leading aerospace manufacturers. Other important industries include heavy machinery, rail and ship design, energy, government, life and earth sciences, and consumer electronics. No single customer, nor any of our approximately 300 resellers and OEMS, accounted for more than 3% of our 2017 software billings. 
 For a summary of our financial information by geographic location, see Note 19 of Notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15, Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference. 
 Competition 
 The market for CAE software is highly fragmented but has been undergoing significant consolidation. Our primary competitors include Dassault Systèmes, Siemens, Ansys and MSC Software, a Hexagon company. Dassault and Siemens are large public companies, with significant financial resources, which have historically focused on CAD and product data management. More recently, these two companies have been investing in simulation software via acquisitions. Ansys and MSC are focused on CAE. In addition to these competitors, we compete with many smaller companies offering CAE software applications. 
 We believe the breadth and depth of Altairs software offering is unique in the PLM industry. We also believe no single competitor addresses our entire solution set. Our integrated suite of software optimizes design performance across multiple disciplines encompassing structures (including crashworthiness and safety), motion, fluids, thermal management, electromagnetics, system modeling and embedded systems, while also providing data analytics and true-to-life visualization and rendering. The HyperWorks Units model further extends this advantage with a growing APA marketplace of third party software. 
 Our simulation solutions including modeling, visualization and solvers are noted in the market for their ability to handle large and complex models. Our software applications deliver high performance and high scalability, including massive parallelization, which is extremely important in the CAE market. Altair is a leader in integrating optimization technology across all our products including multi-disciplinary applications. 
 To ensure customer success and deepen our relationships with them, we engage with our customers to provide consulting, implementation services, training, and support, especially when applying optimization. We believe these services, combined with our ability to leverage HPC as the industry transitions to cloud computing, positions us for future success. 
 We compete on a variety of factors including the breadth, depth, performance, and quality of our technical solutions. We believe our patented units-based subscription licensing model provides us with a competitive advantage by lowering barriers to adoption, creating broad engagement, and encouraging users to work within our ecosystem. 
 Intellectual property 
 We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We actively protect our investment in technology through establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights. We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protections, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions. The nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on, among other things, the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we, inclusive of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, have 165 issued patents and more than 80 published patent applications worldwide. These patents and patent applications seek to protect proprietary inventions relevant to our business. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Additionally, we are the registered holder of a variety of trademarks and domain names that include Altair and similar variations. 
 Nonetheless, our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws and enforcement of the laws of various countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. Our inability to assert or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business. 
 
9 
 
From time to time, we receive claims alleging infringement of a third partys intellectual property rights, including patents. Disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to, among other things, costly litigation, diversion of time, money and resources to develop or obtain non-infringing products, or delay product distribution. Any significant impairment of our core intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. 
 Our products are licensed to users pursuant to signed license agreements or click through agreements containing restrictions on use, duplication, disclosure, and transfer. Cloud based products and associated services are provided to users pursuant to online or signed terms of service agreements containing appropriate restrictions on access and use. 
 We are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists. We believe, however, that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results. We believe that our predominant subscription based business model combined with the change from desktop to cloud based computing will shift the incentives and means by which software is pirated. 
 In addition, through various licensing arrangements, we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others. We expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure additional licensing arrangements in the future, as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions, to support continued development and sales of our products and services. Some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees. The amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors, including but not limited to: the structure of royalty payments, offsetting considerations, if any, and the degree of use of the licensed technology. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had over 2,000 in-house employees and over 400 on-site Client Engineering Service employees globally. Over two-thirds of our employees are located in the United States, India, France, Germany and China. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor organization or are party to any collective bargaining arrangement. In certain of the European countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements in relation to the establishment of works councils. We are often required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these works councils. We have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe our employee relations are good. 
Acquisitions 
 We acquired 20 companies or strategic technologies since 1996, including 12 in the last three years. These acquisitions brought strategic IP assets, and approximately 200 developers with expertise in disciplines ranging from electronics, material science, crash and safety to industrial design and rendering. Products which are commercially available as a result of these acquisitions include Click2Extrude, Altair PBS Professional, Radioss, Evolve, Acusolve, SimLab, Embed, Click2Cast, Multi-scale Designer, FEKO, FLUX, WinProp, Thea Render, Modeliis, Carriots, and ESAComp.

Seasonal variations 
 We have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal variations in the timing of customers purchases of our software and services. Many customers make purchase decisions based on their fiscal year budgets, which often coincide with the calendar year. These seasonal trends materially affect the timing of our cash flows, as license fees become due at the time the license term commences based upon agreed payment terms that customers may not adhere to. As a result, new and renewal licenses have been concentrated in the first and fourth quarter of the year, and our cash flows from operations have been highest late in the first quarter and early in the second quarter of the succeeding fiscal year. 
 Backlog 
 We generally enter into single year term-based software licensing subscription contracts for our solutions. The timing of our invoices to the customer is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts. For multi-year agreements, it is common to invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenues, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements and are considered by us to be backlog. As we generally enter into single year subscription contracts for our platform, backlog is not significant.
