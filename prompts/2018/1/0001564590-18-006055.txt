ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
 We are a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company developing first-in-class pharmacological therapies to treat blinding diseases of the eye. Our current product candidates focus on diseases affecting the retina, which is the tissue that lines the inside of the eye and is primarily responsible for vision, and the choroid, which is the layer adjacent to the retina that supplies the retina with blood, oxygen and nourishment. With our proprietary microinjector, drugs are injected into and spread through the suprachoroidal space, or SCS, which is the space located between the choroid and the outer protective layer of the eye known as the sclera. With the suprachoroidal injection, our product candidates are more directly administered to the retina and choroid as compared to other ocular drug administration techniques such as injections of drug into the vitreous, a jelly-like substance that occupies the central portion of the eye. Intravitreal injections rely on diffusion of drug outward from the vitreous to the retina and choroid. This diffusion can result in lower concentrations of drug in these targeted areas. At the same time, this diffusion can also result in drug spreading to unintended parts of the eye, where, for some drugs, it can cause significant side effects. We believe treatment of eye disease via suprachoroidal injection of product candidates may provide a number of benefits, including lower frequency of administration and faster onset of therapeutic effect. We hold the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize pharmacological agents for treatment of eye diseases via suprachoroidal injection. We estimate that there are nearly five million people in the United States diagnosed with our target therapeutic indications and that worldwide annual sales of drugs to treat these indications were over $7 billion in 2015. 
 Our most advanced product candidates are based on commonly used ophthalmic drugs, which we believe will allow us to more efficiently and predictably pursue the regulatory approval of these product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Under Section 505(b)(2), if we can establish that reliance on the Food and Drug Administration’s, or FDA’s, previous findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product is scientifically appropriate, or there is scientific literature to support the product’s safety or effectiveness, or both, it may eliminate the need for us to conduct some of the preclinical studies or clinical trials for a new product candidate that might otherwise have been required. 
 Our current and planned development programs aim to restore or improve visual function primarily by reducing the macular edema associated with a number of diseases affecting vision. Macular edema is the build-up of fluid that can cause abnormal swelling of the macula, the portion of the retina responsible for central vision and color perception. This swelling can rapidly result in deterioration of vision and can eventually lead to blindness. We are developing suprachoroidal CLS-TA, a proprietary, preservative-free formulation of the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide, or TA, specifically designed to be administered suprachoroidally using our SCS Microinjector for the treatment of macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the choroid and surrounding tissues not caused by an infectious agent. We estimate that non-infectious uveitis affects over 350,000 patients in the United States, approximately one third of whom develop macular edema. The most common treatment for uveitic macular edema involves the use of corticosteroids, such as TA, or other immunosuppressive agents that are administered either systemically or locally.
 
On March 5, 2018, we announced positive topline results from our PEACHTREE Phase 3 clinical trial of CLS-TA for the treatment of macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. We enrolled 160 patients in the trial, of which 96 patients were randomized to the treatment arm to receive two 4.0 mg doses of suprachoroidal CLS-TA 12 weeks apart, and 64 patients were randomized to undergo a sham procedure at the same 12-week intervals. Patients were evaluated every four weeks for a total of 24 weeks, and a total of 155 patients, or 97% of those enrolled, completed the full evaluation period of the trial. The trial met the primary endpoint with 47% of patients who received suprachoroidal CLS-TA every 12 weeks gaining at least 15 letters in best corrected visual acuity, or BCVA, as measured using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study, or ETDRS, scale, from baseline at week 24, compared to 16% of patients who underwent a sham procedure. This improvement was statistically significant, with a p-value of less than 0.001. P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of 0.05 or less represents statistical significance, meaning that there is a less than 1-in-20 likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. The improvements in BCVA from baseline were better in the treatment arm than the sham arm at each monthly evaluation. The mean improvement from baseline was maintained throughout the evaluation period, with 9.6 letters gained at week 4 and 13.7 letters gained at week 24 in the active arm, compared to 1.2 letters gained at week 4 and 2.9 letters gained at week 24 in the control arm.
 
Administration of suprachoroidal CLS-TA also resulted in a mean reduction from baseline of 157 microns in central subfield thickness at week 24 in the active arm compared to a 19 micron mean reduction in the sham arm, a result that was also statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.001.

Suprachoroidal CLS-TA was generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in the trial. Through 24 weeks, steroid-related elevated intraocular pressure, or IOP, adverse events were reported for approximately 11.5% of patients in the CLS-TA treatment group, compared to no patients in the sham group.
 
Based in part on the results from PEACHTREE, we intend to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, for CLS-TA for the treatment of patients with non-infectious uveitis by the end of 2018.
 In the first quarter of 2016, we received data from a Phase 2 clinical trial in 22 patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. Patients in this trial achieved a statistically significant (p=0.0017) mean change from baseline in retinal thickness at eight weeks, which was the primary endpoint of the trial, as well as statistically significant (p=0.0004) mean improvement from baseline in BCVA at eight weeks, a secondary endpoint. At four and eight weeks, the average reductions in retinal thickness were 135 and 164 microns, respectively, from a mean baseline of 526 microns, and the average improvements in BCVA were 7.7 and 9.2 letters, respectively, from a mean baseline of 60 letters. In our previously completed Phase 1/2 clinical trial, we observed a range of improvements in BCVA of between one and five lines on a standard eye chart, with each line of improvement corresponding to five ETDRS letters. At the end of week 12, the average improvement in BCVA exceeded two lines, which is considered meaningful in standard clinical practice. At the end of week 26, four of the eight patients in the trial had still not required additional treatment. For those four patients, the average improvement in BCVA was nearly three lines at week 26. 
 We are also developing CLS-TA along with an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, or anti-VEGF, agent for the treatment of macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion, or RVO, a sight-threatening disorder resulting from the blockage of a retinal vein, that we estimate affects 2.2 million patients in the United States. We are exploring whether suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with an anti-VEGF agent can provide improved visual acuity, reduced macular edema and reduced injection frequency as compared to administration of an intravitreal anti-VEGF agent alone. Corticosteroids and anti-VEGF agents each have known advantages in treating RVO.
 
We have completed a Phase 2 clinical trial, known as TANZANITE, in 46 patients with macular edema associated with RVO. In this trial, 23 patients in the active arm initially received suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with an intravitreal injection of the anti-VEGF agent Eylea, or intravitreal Eylea, and 23 patients in the control arm initially received only intravitreal Eylea. The objective of the trial was to determine whether patients receiving suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with intravitreal Eylea could sustain improvements in visual acuity and reductions in macular edema over the three months of the clinical trial while requiring fewer additional Eylea treatments than patients receiving intravitreal Eylea alone. Patients in each arm were evaluated at months one, two and three after the initial treatment using pre-specified criteria to determine if they continued to experience macular edema or reductions in visual acuity and therefore required additional intravitreal Eylea treatments. The primary endpoint of the trial was met, with patients in the active arm requiring an aggregate of 60% fewer additional Eylea treatments than patients in the control arm over three months, a result that was statistically significant (p=0.013). In addition, based on a post-hoc analysis, 18 of the 23 patients, or 78%, in the active arm of the trial did not require additional treatments during the three-month trial compared to 7 of the 23 patients, or 30%, in the control arm, a result that was also statistically significant (p=0.003). In the same Phase 2 trial, patients in the active arm experienced greater improvement in visual acuity than those in the control arm, with patients in the active arm experiencing mean BCVA improvements at months one, two and three of 16, 20 and 19 letters, respectively, compared to improvements of 11, 12 and 11 letters, respectively, in the control arm at the same time points. We also extended our evaluation of the patients who participated in the trial and did not receive any additional Eylea treatment during the initial three-month evaluation period to further assess the durability of suprachoroidal CLS-TA in combination with intravitreal Eylea for an additional six months following completion of the trial.  Of the 32 eligible patients, the medical records of 31 patients were obtained for review.  Based on combined data from the initial and extended evaluation periods, 17 of the 23 patients in the combination arm, or 74%, did not receive any additional treatment over the nine-month period, compared to only 4 of 23 patients, or 17%, in the control arm. 
 
Based on the results of TANZANITE and after incorporating feedback from an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA held in late 2016, we began to enroll patients in a Phase 3 clinical trial, which we refer to as SAPPHIRE, in the first quarter of 2017. We are continuing to enroll patients in SAPPHIRE, a multicenter, randomized, masked, controlled Phase 3 trial, to assess the efficacy and safety of suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with intravitreal Eylea in patients with RVO.  Patients in the combination treatment arm will receive suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with intravitreal Eylea at the beginning of the trial, intravitreal Eylea alone at week 4, and suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with intravitreal Eylea at weeks 12 and 24. Patients in the control arm will receive intravitreal Eylea alone at the beginning of the trial and follow-up intravitreal Eylea alone every four weeks through and including week 24. After 24 weeks, patients will be followed for approximately an additional six months with patients in each arm having the opportunity to receive treatment as needed based on monthly evaluations. The primary objective of this trial will be to determine the proportion of patients in each arm with a BCVA improvement of at least 15 letters from baseline at eight weeks after initial treatment.  There will be several secondary efficacy and safety endpoints that will also be evaluated.  We anticipate total enrollment of approximately 460 patients in the trial. We expect to report preliminary results from SAPPHIRE in the fourth quarter of 2018.

In addition, in the third quarter of 2017, we began the start-up activities for a second Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with RVO, which we refer to as TOPAZ. We enrolled the first patient in TOPAZ in March 2018. Similar to the SAPPHIRE trial, TOPAZ is a multicenter, randomized, masked, controlled Phase 3 trial, to assess the efficacy and safety of suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with an intravitreal anti-VEGF agent (either Lucentis or Avastin) in patients with RVO.  Patients in the combination treatment arm will receive suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with an intravitreal anti-VEGF agent at the beginning of the trial, intravitreal anti-VEGF agent alone at week 4, and suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with intravitreal anti-VEGF agent at weeks 12 and 24. Patients in the control arm will receive intravitreal anti-VEGF agent alone at the beginning of the trial and follow-up intravitreal anti-VEGF agent alone every four weeks through and including week 24. After 24 weeks, patients will be followed for approximately an additional six months with patients in each arm having the opportunity to receive treatment as needed based on monthly evaluations. The primary objective of this trial will be to determine the proportion of patients in each arm with a BCVA improvement of at least 15 letters from baseline at eight weeks after initial treatment. Several secondary efficacy and safety endpoints will also be evaluated.  We anticipate total enrollment of approximately 460 patients in the trial.
 
We are also developing suprachoroidal CLS-TA for the treatment of diabetic macular edema, or DME. In April 2017, we completed enrollment of 20 patients with DME in an open-label, multi-center Phase 1/2 clinical trial, which we refer to as HULK, to obtain safety data and to observe efficacy outcomes from administering a combination of intravitreal Eylea and suprachoroidal CLS-TA, as well as suprachoroidal CLS-TA alone, over a six-month evaluation period. In November 2017, we announced preliminary results from the HULK trial. In the trial, we observed a visual benefit for patients receiving CLS-TA, with a greater benefit in treatment naïve eyes.  Anatomic improvement was observed in all treated eyes, with more than two-thirds of those eyes achieving a greater than 50% reduction in excess central retinal thickness based on monthly measurements through six months after initial treatment. In the treatment naïve group, 40% of patients did not require retreatment over the entire six months, with an additional 20% requiring only one retreatment. Suprachoroidal CLS-TA, including in patients who received as many as five injections, was well tolerated, with a low incidence of ocular side effects, including IOP elevations.
 In July 2017, we commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial, which we refer to as TYBEE, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of administering a combination of intravitreal Eylea and suprachoroidal CLS-TA to patients with DME, as compared to intravitreal Eylea alone. We completed enrollment of 71 patients in this trial in October 2017. Patient follow-up in TYBEE is six months after initial treatment and we expect to report preliminary data in the second quarter of 2018.
 Finally, multiple nonclinical studies, both internally and with multiple collaborators, are underway in development areas such as gene therapy for inherited retinal disorders, neovascular age-related macular degeneration, also known as wet AMD, and other ocular diseases that may benefit from suprachoroidal administration of medication.
 We believe administration of pharmacological agents via suprachoroidal injection may provide improved levels of those agents to the targeted retina and choroid, with a medication like CLS-TA, a corticosteroid, remaining more localized and away from other parts of the eye, where it could cause side effects. Corticosteroids are effective both at treating the inflammatory aspect of ocular disease and at reducing macular edema, but when delivered locally either topically as drops, intravitreally or by periocular injection, they have been associated with significant side effects, such as cataract formation or exacerbation and elevated IOP, which can lead to glaucoma. Anti-VEGF drugs, while highly effective in reducing macular edema, require frequent administration, in most cases either monthly or every other month after an initial period of monthly treatments. We believe that our differentiated approach of injecting ocular drugs into the SCS may result in fewer side effects and improved amounts of drug at the diseased retina and choroid, as compared to intravitreal administration, a faster onset of therapeutic effect, a similar efficacy profile with lower drug amounts required, and longer duration of therapeutic effect with less frequent required injections. The procedure for suprachoroidal injection is conducted in an in-office setting and is similar in terms of patient preparation and duration to the procedure for intravitreal injection, and we therefore expect our products, if they achieve regulatory approval, to be incorporated into uveitis and retina specialists’ standard medical practice. 
 Our drug candidates, SCS Microinjector and method of drug administration into the SCS are protected by 12 issued U.S. patents and three allowed U.S. applications broadly directed to methods of administering drugs into the SCS by injection, including one design patent. In addition, our patent estate includes 17 patent applications pending in the United States, 18 issued foreign patents, eight pending international PCT applications and 37 patent applications pending in major international markets, including the European Union, Canada, India, Japan, China and Australia, relating to our SCS delivery technology, as well as the formulations of our current therapeutic drug candidates and delivery device. Our issued patents are not scheduled to expire until 2027, 2029, 2033 and 2034, respectively. Our patent applications relate to suprachoroidal injection technology and methods, our current therapeutic drug candidates and formulations, various therapeutic uses, including treatment of specific indications such as non-infectious uveitis and RVO, as well as DME and wet AMD, and administration of classes of drugs to the SCS, including anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-VEGF drugs. Our pending patent applications are not projected to expire until between 2027 and 2035. If any of our product candidates are approved, we plan to build a specialized team of 30 to 40 sales and medical marketing support professionals to target 
 5


the approximately 1,900 uveitis and retina specialists in the United States, and we may also pursue collaborations with third parties to commercialize any of our drugs approved for marketing outside the United States.

 The Clearside approach 
 We are developing product candidates for the treatment of back of the eye diseases to be administered via suprachoroidal injection using our proprietary SCS Microinjector. We believe that our novel approach to treatment of eye diseases, through patented suprachoroidal drug administration, may provide a number of potential benefits, including: 

• | Improved bioavailability at the site of disease and faster onset of therapeutic effect. In preclinical studies, we observed higher amounts of drug present in the retina and choroid following suprachoroidal injection, both at early time points and over the course of the experimental timeframe, as compared to the amounts of the same drug present over time in the retina and choroid following intravitreal administration. We believe this suggests that treatment using suprachoroidal injection of a drug may have a faster onset of therapeutic effect as compared to intravitreal administration, along with similar or better efficacy, in diseases such as uveitis, RVO and DME.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Similar efficacy profile with lower drug amounts required. In a preclinical study in an animal model of uveitis, suprachoroidal injection of TA achieved similar efficacy results with only 10% of the drug amount administered through intravitreal injection. We believe this suggests our approach may allow us to develop ocular therapies with similar efficacy, but with lower amounts of active drug, compared to current therapies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Less frequent injections. Current treatments for RVO require monthly intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF drugs. For RVO patients, we believe that a combination of an intravitreal injection of an anti-VEGF drug that addresses the vascular aspect of the disease, together with suprachoroidal CLS-TA, which addresses the inflammatory aspect of RVO, may have efficacy similar to that of monthly intravitreal anti-VEGF injections but with a reduction in the frequency of treatment to once every 90 days.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhanced safety profile. Intravitreal injections result in drugs diffusing throughout the eye, including to the lens, iris and ciliary body at the front of the eye, which for some drugs, such as corticosteroids, has been associated with safety issues, such as cataract formation or exacerbation and elevated IOP levels, which can lead to glaucoma. Intravitreal administration of TA has been associated with cataracts and increases in IOP levels in 20% to 60% of patients. Because suprachoroidal injection of drugs in preclinical studies appeared to result in drug remaining mostly localized in the retina and choroid without substantial diffusion to the vitreous or the front portion of the eye, we believe suprachoroidal injection has the potential to reduce the incidence of these side effects. In our three clinical trials of CLS-TA, a total of 121 uveitis patients have been dosed, with follow-up evaluations for up to six months after initial treatment. No serious adverse events related to treatment were observed in these three trials. The incidence of IOP increase among these 121 uveitis patients administered with suprachoroidal injection of 4 mg of TA was 9%.

• | Incorporated into standard medical practice. If approved for marketing, our drugs will be packaged together with our SCS Microinjector for use by uveitis and retina specialists. The procedure for suprachoroidal injection with our SCS Microinjector is intended to be conducted in an in-office setting and is similar in terms of patient preparation and duration of the procedure for intravitreal injection, and we therefore expect our products, if they achieve regulatory approval, to be incorporated into uveitis and retina specialists’ standard medical practice.

We have discussed our proposed development programs with the FDA for our uveitis and RVO programs, but we have not yet done so for our DME development program. 
 CLS-TA for macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis 
 The most common treatment for non-infectious uveitis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the choroid and surrounding tissues, involves the use of corticosteroids, such as TA. CLS-TA is our formulation of TA, and TA is known to be effective in treating uveitis when administered to the eye by other routes of administration. We believe that our product candidate will be at least as effective as commonly used formulations of TA in treating complications of uveitis, including the associated macular edema. If approved, CLS-TA would be the first drug specifically indicated for macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. In August 2017, we completed enrollment of 160 patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis in PEACHTREE, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in which CLS-TA was injected into the SCS with our SCS Microinjector. In PEACHTREE, we met the primary and secondary endpoints of the trial. The administration of suprachoroidal CLS-TA was generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in the trial. Based on the results from PEACHTREE, we intend to submit an NDA for CLS-TA for the treatment of patients with non-infectious uveitis by the end of 2018.
 We have also completed a Phase 2 clinical trial and a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for this indication that we conducted with CLS-TA, the results of which are described below. We believe that CLS-TA will be at least as effective in treating uveitis, including the associated macular edema, as commonly used local treatments with corticosteroids. However, we believe that our suprachoroidal based local treatment may provide improved bioavailability of drug at the diseased retina and choroid, which may result in faster onset of therapeutic effect, a similar efficacy profile with lower drug amounts required, and longer duration of therapeutic effect, potentially resulting in a reduced frequency of necessary injections. We also believe that CLS-TA may result in fewer side effects compared to commonly used corticosteroid treatments. 
 Our clinical development 
 Based on our consultation with the FDA, we have conducted or are conducting the following clinical trials, in each case using TA injected using a prototype of our SCS Microinjector, as part of our uveitis development program: 
  
• | a completed Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis evaluating suprachoroidal CLS-TA with our SCS Microinjector, from which we reported preliminary data in March 2018; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a completed 22-patient Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis evaluating suprachoroidal CLS-TA with our SCS Microinjector, from which we reported data in 2017.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Details of these clinical trials are summarized below. 
 Pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial
 
We have completed PEACHTREE, a pivotal Phase 3 randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CLS-TA administered through the SCS in patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. 
 7


Based on feedback from our end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA held in May 2015, we believe that this trial will be the only pivotal clinical trial necessary to support a filing of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for this indication.
 
Clinical Trial Design. 
 PEACHTREE was conducted at approximately 60 investigational sites and enrolled 160 patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis, randomized either to a treatment arm consisting of approximately 90 patients who received a 4.0 mg dose of suprachoroidal CLS-TA or to a sham injection procedure arm consisting of approximately 60 patients. We used a sham injection procedure as a comparator for suprachoroidal CLS-TA, as opposed to an active drug, because there are no approved therapies for macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis against which to compare CLS-TA, and there are no controlled, randomized trials with data in patients who can be used as an appropriate comparator arm. In order to simulate an injection to maintain masking, the sham injection procedure included all steps involved in the suprachoroidal injection procedure, except that a syringe with a needleless hub was used to apply pressure to the eye. Patients in each arm received their designated procedure at the beginning of the trial and a second procedure of the same type at week 12. All patients were followed and evaluated for a period of six months following the initial procedure. 
 Endpoints. The primary efficacy outcome of the trial was the percentage of patients who experienced an improvement of at least 15 letters in BCVA from baseline at week 24. Secondary efficacy outcomes included additional measures of changes in BCVA and reductions in retinal thickness from baseline. Safety measures were monitored over the 24-week observation period and included the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events and serious adverse events, including cataracts and increases in IOP. 
 Efficacy results.  In PEACHTREE, 45 of the 96 patients, or 47%, who received suprachoroidal CLS-TA at baseline and at 12 weeks gained at least 15 ETDRS letters in BCVA from baseline at week 24, compared to 10 of the 64 patients, or 16%, who underwent sham procedures at baseline and at week 12. This improvement, which was the primary endpoint of the trial, was statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.001. These results are summarized in the figure below.

Further, in terms of improvements in BCVA, the mean change from baseline was better in the treatment arm than the sham arm at each monthly evaluation. The mean improvement from baseline was also maintained throughout the evaluation period, with 9.6 letters gained at week 4 and 13.7 letters at week 24 in the active arm, compared to 1.2 letters at week 4 and 2.9 letters at week 24 in the control arm. The mean improvements in BCVA were statistically significant at each 4-week evaluation point, each with a p-value of less than 0.001.  The mean improvement from baseline at each 4-week evaluation point is shown in the figure below.

For the other key secondary endpoint, administration of suprachoroidal CLS-TA resulted in a mean reduction from baseline of 157 microns in central subfield thickness at week 24 in the active arm compared to a 19 micron mean reduction in the sham arm, a result that was also statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.001. These results are summarized in the figure below.


Safety results. Suprachoroidal CLS-TA was generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in the trial. Through 24 weeks, corticosteroid-related elevated IOP adverse events were reported for 11.5% of patients in the CLS-TA treatment group, compared to no patients in the sham group. 
 
Additional trials. Patients from PEACHTREE will be followed in an extension trial to obtain additional information on the duration of action of CLS-TA. In this extension trial, patients from selected sites from the Phase 3 trial who have not received any other therapy will have the opportunity to be enrolled and will receive no further treatments for their uveitis. Since the last treatment in the Phase 3 trial would have occurred at week 12 following the initial procedure, we expect to enroll patients starting at their week 24 exit visit and to follow eligible patients for an additional 24 weeks or until they receive additional treatment at the election of the evaluating physician in the trial.

An additional 38 patients, with a diagnosis of non-infectious uveitis, were enrolled in a separate clinical trial in order to collect additional safety information to add to our overall safety database to reach the number required for our planned NDA submission. These additional patients will be administered suprachoroidal CLS-TA at baseline and at week 12, and they will be observed and evaluated at visits every 4 weeks after initial treatment, with a final evaluation at week 24.
 Phase 2 clinical trial 
 In addition to PEACHTREE, we completed a Phase 2 multi-center, masked, randomized, dose controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single 4.0 mg or a single 0.8 mg dose of CLS-TA administered through the SCS. 
 Clinical Trial Design. We enrolled 22 patients at 14 sites in this trial. Eligibility criteria included males and non-pregnant females over the age of 18 with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis, with fluid in the retina and retinal thickness above 310 microns and a visual acuity reading better than 20/400 in the study eye, which corresponds to the ability to read 20 or more ETDRS letters of BCVA. Patients were excluded if they had other ocular conditions in the study eye. Patients were randomized to receive a single suprachoroidal injection of one of two doses of CLS-TA, with 17 patients receiving a 4.0 mg dose and five patients receiving a 0.8 mg dose. Patients returned for follow-up examinations between seven days and 11 days, at four weeks and at eight weeks following dosing. 
 Patients enrolled in the trial ranged in age between 20 years and 83 years, with a median age of 53. Of the 22 patients enrolled, 12 were female and 10 were male; 18 were Caucasian and four were African-American. 
 Of the 17 patients in the 4.0 mg treatment group, two patients had anterior uveitis, meaning that the primary site of inflammation is the anterior chamber of the eye; five patients had intermediate uveitis, meaning that the primary site of inflammation is the ciliary body and the vitreous; one patient had posterior uveitis, meaning that the primary site of inflammation is the retina and choroid; and nine patients had pan-uveitis, meaning that the primary site of inflammation involves both the anterior and posterior regions. 
 Endpoints. The primary endpoint in this trial was mean change in retinal thickness from baseline at eight weeks following the suprachoroidal injection of the 4.0 mg dose of CLS-TA. Secondary endpoints included evaluation of changes in BCVA. Only the 17 patients who received the 4.0 mg dose of CLS-TA were evaluated for achievement of these endpoints. The efficacy data from the patients on the 0.8 mg dose is considered exploratory, and therefore was not considered in determining achievement of endpoints. We also evaluated safety endpoints in all 22 patients, including changes in IOP, in this trial. 
 Efficacy results—retinal thickness. Of the 17 patients who received the 4.0 mg dose of CLS-TA, 16 were evaluated for changes in retinal thickness. At four and eight weeks, the average reduction in retinal thickness was 135 and 164 microns, respectively, with p-values of 0.0056 and 0.0017, respectively. These results are summarized in the chart below. 
 Mean reduction in retinal thickness
 
Of these 16 patients evaluated for changes in retinal thickness, nine patients achieved a reduction in retinal thickness to below 310 microns, which represents the maximum retinal thickness for approximately 95% of the population with normal retinas, at both 
 10


week 4 and week 8. In addition, nine patients had reductions in thickness of at least 20% from their baseline levels at week 4, while 11 patients achieved this level of reduction at week 8. 
 Efficacy results—visual acuity. All 17 patients who received the 4.0 mg dose of CLS-TA were evaluated for changes in BCVA, measured using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart, or the ETDRS chart, a standard visual acuity measurement. At four and eight weeks, the average improvement in BCVA was 7.7 and 9.2 letters, respectively, with p-values of 0.0001 and 0.0004, respectively. These results are summarized in the chart below. 
 Improvement in best corrected visual acuity
 
Of the 12 patients evaluated with worse than 20/40 vision, 92% of patients improved by at least five letters, 50% of patients improved by at least 10 letters, 33% of patients improved by at least 15 letters and 8% of patients improved by more than 25 letters. 
 In addition to the improvements in retinal thickness and visual acuity, we also observed improvements in other clinical signs of uveitis in the Phase 2 clinical trial. These included reductions in anterior chamber cells and reductions in anterior chamber flare, as well as improvements in the level of vitreous haze. In each case, the relevant severity scores decreased to zero or near zero or remained close to zero both for the overall average for all the patients as well as individually for a majority of the patients as measured by these markers of inflammation. 
 Safety results. All 22 patients completed the full observation period of the trial, and CLS-TA was generally well tolerated. One patient experienced atrial fibrillation, a condition that resolved in one day. The principal investigator considered this serious adverse event to be unrelated to the treatment, an assessment that was reviewed and approved by an independent medical monitor. There were no serious adverse events related to study treatment and no corticosteroid-related increases in IOP observed in this trial and none of the patients experienced cataracts.
 Regulatory approval pathway 
 Based on the results from PEACHTREE, we intend to submit an NDA for CLS-TA for the treatment of patients with non-infectious uveitis by the end of 2018.  We intend to utilize Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. As part of our NDA submission under Section 505(b)(2), We intend to rely on the results from all of our clinical trials, as well as the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for TA and an analysis of available data from clinical literature, in our planned NDA submission. 
 We are also evaluating a number of options for potential submissions to regulatory agencies in additional territories outside of the United States for CLS-TA for the treatment of patients with non-infectious uveitis. We intend to base any marketing applications in jurisdictions outside the United States, in part, on data obtained through these trials.

CLS-TA for macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion 
 We are developing CLS-TA for treatment of macular edema associated with RVO, a sight-threatening disorder resulting from the blockage of a retinal vein. In this program, we are using suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with intravitreal Eylea. We believe that we may provide a differentiated therapeutic benefit for RVO patients with our combination treatment that potentially couples the advantages of visual acuity gain and macular edema reduction along with a quarterly, rather than monthly, dosing schedule, compared to currently used intravitreal anti-VEGF injections alone. 
 We have completed a 46-patient Phase 2 clinical trial with suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with intravitreal Eylea for the treatment of macular edema associated with RVO. Based on feedback from a meeting with the FDA in late 2016, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial in the first quarter of 2017 and a second Phase 3 clinical trial in the first quarter of 2018. 
 TANZANITE 
 We have completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in which the goal was to confirm that patients treated with suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with intravitreal Eylea would require less frequent treatments than monotherapy of intravitreal Eylea. We enrolled 46 patients at 14 sites in the United States in this trial. All patients in the trial were randomized to receive one intravitreal injection of 2.0 mg of Eylea, in a total volume of 50 microliters, and a single suprachoroidal injection of 4.0 mg of CLS-TA, in a total volume of 100 microliters, or one intravitreal injection of Eylea and a sham SCS procedure in the same visit. After randomization, patients were seen in the clinic once per month for three months. The 23 patients in each of the two treatment arms were evaluated for the need to receive additional intravitreal Eylea alone at months one, two and three after the initial injection using specified criteria to determine if they continued to experience macular edema or reductions in visual acuity, as determined by a masked, centralized reading center. 
 The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with intravitreal Eylea, compared to the control group initially receiving only intravitreal Eylea. The primary efficacy endpoint in the trial was determining the number of follow-up Eylea treatments for which patients met the criteria, which we believe provides an indication of whether concomitant therapy provides any advantage to the patient in reducing the number of required additional intravitreal Eylea treatments. Secondary efficacy endpoints included measures of change in BCVA and reductions in retinal thickness from baseline. The safety endpoints were the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events, including increases in IOP. 
 For the primary endpoint, patients in the active arm, who initially received concomitant injections of CLS-TA into the SCS and Eylea into the vitreous, met the criteria for an aggregate of nine intravitreal Eylea follow-up injections over three months, while patients in the control arm, who initially received only intravitreal Eylea, met the criteria for an aggregate of 23 intravitreal Eylea follow-up injections. These results met the primary endpoint of the trial and were statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.013. In addition, based on a post-hoc analysis, 18 of the 23 patients, or 78%, in the active arm of the trial did not require additional treatments during the three-month trial compared to 7 of the 23 patients, or 30%, in the control arm, a result that was also statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.003. We also extended our evaluation of the patients who participated in the trial and did not receive any additional Eylea treatment during its initial three-month evaluation period to further assess the durability of suprachoroidal CLS-TA in combination with intravitreal Eylea for an additional six months following completion of the trial.  Of the 32 eligible patients, the medical records of 31 patients were obtained for review.  Based on combined data from the initial and extended evaluation periods, 17 of the 23 patients in the combination arm, or 74%, did not receive any additional treatment over the nine-month period, compared to only 4 of 23 patients, or 17%, in the control arm.
 For the BCVA secondary endpoint, patients in the active arm experienced greater improvement in visual acuity than those in the control arm, with patients in the active arm experiencing mean BCVA improvements at months one, two and three of 16, 20 and 19 letters, respectively, from a baseline of 49 letters, compared to improvements of 11, 12 and 11 letters, respectively, in the control arm, at the same time points and also from a baseline of 49 letters. The greater improvement in BCVA observed in the active arm, when compared to the control arm, of 4.7, 8.5 and 7.6 letters, was statistically significant at month two, but was not statistically significant at months one or three. For the retinal thickness endpoint, patients in the active arm had mean levels of reduction of approximately 450 microns after each of one, two and three months. Patients in the control arm achieved a mean reduction of approximately 400 microns after one month, which reduction then declined to approximately 340 microns at months two and three. The trial was not powered to show statistical significance on the secondary endpoints. There were no serious adverse events reported in the trial and the treatment was generally well tolerated. Based on these results, we believe that the combination of suprachoroidal CLS-TA and intravitreal Eylea may provide the benefits of improved visual acuity, reduced macular edema and reduced injection frequency. 
 We have also completed a Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, toxicology study in rabbits with suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with intravitreal Eylea.

SAPPHIRE AND TOPAZ 
 
We held an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the second half of 2016 to discuss the details of the regulatory approval pathway for CLS-TA along with Eylea for the treatment of macular edema associated with RVO. Incorporating feedback from the FDA, we expect to be able to follow a 505(b)(2) NDA regulatory approval pathway, and in the first quarter of 2017 we initiated a Phase 3 clinical program in order to support an NDA submission for CLS-TA in macular edema associated with RVO. In pursuing the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, we intend to rely on the results from our RVO development program as well as the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for both TA and anti-VEGF agents. 
 
We initiated our first randomized, controlled, double-masked Phase 3 clinical trial, SAPPHIRE, with suprachoroidal CLS-TA and intravitreal Eylea for the treatment of RVO in the first quarter of 2017. We intend to conduct this trial at approximately 150 investigational sites and to enroll approximately 460 patients with macular edema associated with RVO, randomized either to a treatment arm consisting of approximately 230 patients or a control arm consisting of approximately 230 patients. Patients in the treatment arm will receive suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with intravitreal Eylea at the beginning of the trial, intravitreal Eylea alone at week 4, and suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with intravitreal Eylea at weeks 12 and 24. Patients in the control arm will receive intravitreal Eylea alone at the beginning of the trial and follow-up treatments of intravitreal Eylea alone every four weeks through week 24. After 24 weeks, patients will be followed for approximately an additional six months. The primary objective of this trial will be to determine the proportion of patients in each arm with a BCVA improvement of at least 15 letters from baseline at eight weeks after initial treatment.  There will be several secondary efficacy and safety endpoints that will also be evaluated. We expect to report preliminary results from SAPPHIRE in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 
In addition, in the first quarter of 2018, we enrolled the first patient in a second Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with RVO, which we refer to as TOPAZ. We intend to enroll approximately 460 patients in TOPAZ, a multicenter, randomized, masked, controlled Phase 3 trial, to assess the efficacy and safety of suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with an intravitreal anti-VEGF agent, which will be either Lucentis or Avastin, in patients with RVO.  Patients in the combination treatment arm will receive suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with the intravitreal anti-VEGF agent at the beginning of the trial, the intravitreal anti-VEGF agent alone at week 4, and suprachoroidal CLS-TA together with the intravitreal anti-VEGF agent at weeks 12 and 24. Patients in the control arm will receive the intravitreal anti-VEGF agent alone at the beginning of the trial and follow-up intravitreal anti-VEGF agent injections alone every four weeks through and including week 24. After 24 weeks, patients will be followed for approximately an additional six months with patients in each arm having the opportunity to receive treatment as needed based on monthly evaluations. The primary objective of this trial will be to determine the proportion of patients in each arm with a BCVA improvement of at least 15 letters from baseline at eight weeks after initial treatment.  There will be several secondary efficacy and safety endpoints that will also be evaluated. 
 Regulatory approval pathway 
 Depending on the results of SAPPHIRE and TOPAZ, we intend to seek regulatory approval of CLS-TA for macular edema associated with RVO by utilizing Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. We intend to rely on the results from all of our clinical trials, as well as the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for TA and an analysis of available data from clinical literature, in our planned NDA submission. 
 We also evaluating a number of options for potential submissions to regulatory agencies in additional territories outside of the United States for CLS-TA for the treatment of patients with non-infectious uveitis. We intend to base any marketing applications in jurisdictions outside the United States, in part, on data obtained through these trials. 
 CLS-TA for diabetic macular edema 
 We are developing CLS-TA, alone or with an anti-VEGF agent, for treatment for DME, a common ocular complication of diabetes that results in swelling in the macula and is the primary cause of vision loss associated with diabetes. 
HULK and TYBEE
 
Our development program for DME is modeled on our approach for the treatment of RVO. We have conducted a multi-center, open-label Phase 1/2 clinical trial, HULK,  to evaluate safety data, and to collect efficacy observations, for the administration of CLS-TA, administered suprachoroidally, both alone and in combination with intravitreal Eylea, in patients with DME over a six-month evaluation period. We enrolled 20 patients in this trial. Efficacy observations included changes in retinal thickness and BCVA. In November 2017, we announced preliminary results from the HULK trial.  In the trial, we observed a visual benefit for patients receiving CLS-TA, with a greater benefit in treatment naïve eyes. Anatomic improvement was observed in all treated eyes, with more than two-thirds of those eyes achieving a greater than 50% reduction in excess central retinal thickness based on monthly 
 13


measurements through 6 months after initial treatment. In the treatment naïve group, 40% of patients did not require retreatment over the entire 6 months, with an additional 20% requiring only one retreatment. Suprachoroidal CLS-TA, including in patients who received as many as five injections, was well tolerated, with a low incidence of ocular side effects, including IOP elevations.
 In addition, in July 2017, we commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial, TYBEE, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CLS-TA administered suprachoroidally together with intravitreal Eylea as compared to intravitreal Eylea only, in patients with DME over a nine-month evaluation period. We enrolled 71 patients in this trial.  The primary endpoint is the change in BCVA from baseline. Patient follow-up in TYBEE is six months after initial treatment and we expect to report preliminary data in the second quarter of 2018.
 Future potential product candidates 
 We believe that our SCS-focused approach has the potential to become more broadly used for the treatment of other back of the eye diseases, and we intend to develop additional product candidates for suprachoroidal injection based on the results of our current and planned clinical trials. We will then seek to secure appropriate regulatory authorizations to begin additional clinical testing for any such product candidates. In addition to uveitis, RVO and DME, there are a number of ophthalmic conditions affecting the retina and choroid with unmet medical need for which suprachoroidal injection of medication may be beneficial and for which we may seek marketing authorization, including: 
  
• | Wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, a condition involving the abnormal formation and growth of new blood vessels in the choroid, their intrusion into the outer layers of the retina and the leakage of blood and fluid into the retina;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, or PCV, a disorder resulting from the abnormal growth of new blood vessels in the choroid adjacent to the macula. PCV is characterized by dilated and branching blood vessels in “polyp like” groups in the choroid that could lead to leakage;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Geographic atrophy, an advanced form of AMD, is characterized by a loss of the layers of cells in the retina next to the choroid, eventually including the photoreceptor cells in the macula, leading to gradual irreversible loss of central vision and eventually blindness; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pseudophakic cystoid macular edema, also known as Irvine-Gass syndrome, a common cause of visual impairment after cataract surgery.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are evaluating the use of our SCS Microinjector to administer sustained-release formulations of known glaucoma drugs. Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease in which elevated levels of IOP are associated with damage to the optic nerve, which results in irreversible vision loss and potentially blindness. The National Eye Institute estimates that 2.7 million Americans suffered from glaucoma in 2010. Glaucoma is treated by the reduction of elevated IOP, which has been shown to slow the progression of vision loss. Once glaucoma develops, it is a chronic condition that requires life-long treatment. The treatment of glaucoma, if successful, would be through the suprachoroidal administration of latanoprost or other drugs known to lower elevated IOP associated with glaucoma. 
 We are also evaluating the potential use of our SCS Microinjector to inject sustained-release formulations of other ocular therapies. We believe these formulations could include hydrogels, emulsions and liposomes, as well as treatments containing agents such as hyaluronic acid or micro- or nanoparticles. 
 The SCS Microinjector 
 Our drug candidates have been and will be specifically formulated to be injected with our SCS Microinjector via suprachoroidal injection in order to spread around to the back of the eye. The single-use microinjector is intended to consistently inject drug into the SCS, in volumes similar to the amount of drug commonly used in intravitreal injections. If our products are approved for marketing by applicable regulatory authorities, we will package the drug along with the SCS Microinjector and two 30-gauge hollow microneedles of varying lengths, each less than 1.2 millimeters, within a custom-designed hub that optimizes insertion and suprachoroidal administration of drugs.
 14


Our proprietary SCS Microinjector, shown below, can be used to inject a wide variety of drugs into the SCS. 
 
The suprachoroidal injection is designed to be carried out perpendicular to the sclera, at a site similar to an intravitreal injection, under local anesthesia. Once the microneedle penetrates the sclera and reaches the SCS, the boundary between the sclera and the choroid, the open bevel of the needle releases the drug between these two layers. Once drug is injected into the SCS, it spreads within the SCS to the back of the eye, where diseases manifest. The preparation and injection will require minimal training for the administering retinal specialist and can be accomplished in an in-office setting. 
 Current intravitreal injections are performed in a procedure similar to that of suprachoroidal injections, except that the hypodermic needles and syringes used in intravitreal injection procedures are designed so that the needle penetrates through all of the layers of the eye and drug is injected into the vitreous cavity, where the precise spatial location of the needle is not as important as when injecting into the SCS. Intravitreal injections are typically performed using a needle that is approximately five millimeters in length, or four times the length of our microneedle. Using a needle of this length, the physician penetrates past the sclera, choroid and retina until reaching the vitreous and does not receive any tactile feedback as to when the needle had reached one of the layers between the sclera and the vitreous. By contrast, our SCS Microinjector is designed to inject drug into the SCS. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own any manufacturing facilities. We utilize contract manufacturers to formulate and produce our drug candidates and to produce our SCS Microinjector used for our clinical trials. We procure the active pharmaceutical ingredient for our drugs from a third-party supplier. We expect to utilize third-party manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of our drugs and SCS Microinjector, if approved. We anticipate entering into commercial supply agreements with these or other manufacturers at a later date. 
Commercialization 
 We intend to develop and, if approved by the FDA, to commercialize our product candidates in the United States, and we may enter into distribution or licensing arrangements for commercialization rights for other regions. Our management team, who will lead the commercialization of our lead product candidates, has substantial experience in sales and marketing based on their participation in the commercialization of ophthalmic drugs at large pharmaceutical companies including Genentech, Alcon, Allergan, CIBA Vision and Novartis. 
 There are approximately 1,900 uveitis and retina specialists in the United States. We believe we will be able to reach this concentrated set of specialists efficiently, limiting the size of our sales force and other field team members required.
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research 
 15


institutions. Any product candidate that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 With respect to CLS-TA, we face competition from other commercially available forms of TA and other injectable and implantable corticosteroids. Bristol-Myers Squibb markets TA under the brand name Kenalog. Kenalog is indicated only for intramuscular or intraarticular injection; however, it is used off-label for intraocular inflammation. There are also a number of generic equivalents of Kenalog. In addition, Alcon’s injectable TA, Triesence, is approved in the United States for the treatment of uveitis and other inflammatory conditions unresponsive to topical corticosteroids, although it is not indicated for the treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis or RVO or DME. Ozurdex, marketed by Allergan, is a bioerodable extended release implant that delivers the corticosteroid dexamethasone and is approved for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye and for macular edema due to RVO in both the United States and in the European Union, and received approval from the FDA to treat DME. Bausch + Lomb markets Retisert, an intravitreal implant of the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis. Iluvien, an injectable form of fluocinolone acetonide marketed by Alimera Sciences, has been approved in both the United States and the European Union for the treatment of DME. 
 Our product candidates will also compete with anti-VEGF drugs, which are the current standard of care for RVO, wet AMD and DME. Genentech’s products Lucentis and Avastin are both anti-VEGF antibodies. Lucentis is currently approved in the United States and European Union for the treatment of wet AMD, macular edema following RVO, DME and diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME. Avastin is an anti-VEGF drug used off-label by uveitis and retina specialists in both the United States and in certain countries of the European Union for the treatment of numerous retinal diseases, but it is not indicated for ophthalmic use. In the United States, Regeneron’s anti-VEGF product, Eylea, is approved for the treatment of wet AMD, macular edema following RVO and DME and diabetic retinopathy. In the European Union, Eylea is approved for the treatment of wet AMD, DME and RVO. 
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient recruitment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or obtaining FDA market exclusivity, thereby delaying our product approvals. Competitors’ patent protection could also potentially delay FDA approval of our product candidates for up to 30 months, and we will still be subject to potential patent litigation that might arise beyond the 30 months. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, method of administration, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Intellectual property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our technologies and methods of accessing the SCS, drug candidates and formulations as well as patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for novel applications, uses, and technological innovations related to our drug candidates, proprietary delivery devices and core technologies. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 Patents and patent applications 
 Our patent estate, on a worldwide basis, includes 12 granted U.S. patents and three allowed U.S. applications broadly directed to methods of administering drugs into the SCS by injection, including one design patent. In addition, our patent estate includes 17 patent applications pending in the United States, 18 issued foreign patents, three pending international PCT applications and 37 patent applications pending in major international markets, including the European Union, Canada, India, Japan, China and Australia, relating to our SCS delivery technology, as well as the formulations of our current therapeutic drug candidates and delivery device. Of these patents and patent applications, we license five of the 12 issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. applications, nine of the issued foreign patents, and eight foreign patent applications in major international markets, each relating to methods of delivering drugs to the eye by microneedle administration, pursuant to a license agreement with Georgia Tech Research Corporation and Emory University that is described below. With respect to the in-licensed international PCT applications, according to the terms of the license 
 16


agreement, we advise Georgia Tech and Emory regarding the countries in which patent applications should be pursued. Subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges, our issued in-licensed U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2027 and 2029, without taking into account possible patent term adjustments or extensions. Applications relating to SCS delivery technology and methods, our current therapeutic drug candidates and formulations, various therapeutic uses, including treatment of specific indications such as macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis and RVO, wet AMD as well as DME and improvement of specified clinical parameters, are expected to expire between 2027 and 2037, without taking into account possible patent term adjustments or extensions. 
 The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be extended by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. 
 Our product candidates are protected against genericization through several levels of patents, including the patented approach of administration into the SCS. In the case of CLS-TA injected into the SCS, an applicant who files a paragraph 4 ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA certifying they may circumvent our patents must also demonstrate comparability of the proposed drug, which we believe may require a clinical trial in macular edema associated with uveitis, against our product, unless a biowaiver is obtained. 
 Third-party patent filings 
 Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products, including patents and applications related to surgical methods of accessing the SCS and certain formulations of TA. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. 
 Under U.S. law, a person may be able to patent a discovery of a new way to use a previously known compound, even if such compound itself is patented, provided the newly discovered use is novel and nonobvious. Such a method-of-use patent, however, if valid, only protects the use of a claimed compound for the specified methods claimed in the patent. This type of patent does not prevent persons from using the compound for any previously known use of the compound. Further, this type of patent does not prevent persons from making and marketing the compound for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. 
 License agreement with Emory and Georgia Tech 
 In July 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Emory University, or Emory, and the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, or GTRC, under which we received a worldwide exclusive license to specified patents relating to methods and devices for drug delivery using a microinjector. The field of the license covers all ophthalmic uses of the microinjector for mammals and birds. Under this license agreement, we have agreed to direct all prosecution of intellectual property to the licensors’ patent counsel and have agreed to pay for all intellectual property expenses associated with the licensed patents. 
 Under this license agreement, we made an initial $30,000 upfront payment and a $35,000 milestone payment upon dosing of the first human patient in a clinical trial. This license agreement requires us to make a $75,000 milestone payment upon the occurrence of a specified event relating to the commercialization of a drug developed using the licensed patents. We are obligated to pay an annual license maintenance fee of $25,000, which will continue until the first commercial sale of a product covered by the licensed patents. Additionally, we will owe a low single-digit royalty on any worldwide net product sales related to the licensed patents, with minimum annual royalties starting at $15,000 per year after commercialization. The minimum annual royalty increases each year after the first commercial sale, up to a maximum amount of $100,000 per year in the sixth calendar year and in subsequent years. 
 We are solely responsible for the development and commercialization of products related to the licensed patients. We are obligated to provide Emory and GTRC a written report detailing our activities related to the development and commercialization of products twice a year. 
 Royalties are calculated based on net sales of products covered by a patent licensed under the agreement, and are due on each such product sold as long as the patent covering that particular product is valid and unexpired. Unless otherwise terminated pursuant to its termination provisions, this license agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents. We have the right to terminate this license agreement at any time upon 60 days’ written notice to Emory and GTRC. Emory and GTRC 
 17


may also terminate this license agreement in the event of a material breach by us. This license agreement will immediately terminate if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents in a court or other governmental agency of competent jurisdiction. 
 Research, option and license agreement with Spark Therapeutics 
 In April 2015, we entered into a research, option and license agreement with Spark Therapeutics, Inc., or Spark, under which we granted Spark the option to license exclusive rights to our SCS Microinjector technology and related intellectual property for use in delivering gene therapies to the back of the eye. Under this agreement, we and Spark explored the feasibility of using our SCS Microinjector to deliver gene therapies to the choroid and the retina through the SCS for the treatment of several orphan diseases of the back of the eye. 
 Under the agreement, Spark made a $500,000 upfront payment to us. In February 2016, the initial study under the agreement was completed and Spark elected not to extend the arrangement or license the technology. Accordingly, the agreement expired in accordance with its terms. 
 Trademarks, trade secrets and know-how 
 Our trademark portfolio currently consists of one trademark registered in the European Union, one trademark registered in the European Union and New Zealand, and three pending U.S. trademark applications, as well as pending trademark applications in the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, China, India, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea. In addition to patent and trademark protection, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants, and employees. These and other agreements, such as invention assignment agreements, grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. 
 Government regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and device products under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. While it may be the case that when a drug and a device are used together, which is called a combination product, the FDA typically regulates the dispenser of a drug, such as a syringe co-packaged with a drug, as a drug itself. Based on our pre-IND meeting with the FDA, we believe that CLS-TA and our SCS Microinjector will be subject to regulation as drugs, as the SCS Microinjector used to dispense the drug will be packaged together with the CLS-TA. 
 In the case of our product candidates, the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, has primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval of our product candidates. We have been advised that, within CDER, the division responsible for ophthalmology, which will have primary jurisdiction, views our product candidate as a drug. Accordingly, we plan to investigate our products through the IND framework and seek approval through the NDA pathway. Based on our discussions with the FDA to date, we do not anticipate that the FDA will require changes to this approach, although the FDA could change its position during the course of its review of any marketing application that we may submit.
 Drugs 
 The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are governed by extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The FDA, under the FDCA, regulates pharmaceutical products in the United States. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include: 

• | preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under GLP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------

 18


 
• | FDA acceptance, review and approval of the NDA, which might include an Advisory Committee review; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain. The FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of the product candidate, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced. The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. The FDA may nevertheless initiate a clinical hold after the 30 days if, for example, significant public health risks arise. 
 Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each of the sites at which the trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. 
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap. These phases generally include the following: 
 Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently healthy volunteers. In Phase 1, the product candidate is usually tested for safety, including adverse effects, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacodynamics. 
 Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to (1) evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications, (2) determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. 
 Phase 3. If a product candidate is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 clinical trials, the clinical trial program will be expanded to Phase 3 clinical trials to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. 
 Phase 4 clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post-market requirements or commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in enforcement action or withdrawal of approval. 
 The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture, composition and quality of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, requesting approval to market the product. The application must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment, although waivers may be granted in limited cases. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. 
 Review of application 
 Once an NDA has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission, the FDA sets a user fee goal date that informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review. The Company will be required to pay a user fee to the FDA to review the NDA, unless it receives a waiver or qualifies for an exemption. This is typically 10 months from the date of submission for drugs that are not new molecular entities, such as our product candidates. The review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with cGMPs and may also inspect clinical trial sites for integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy. The device component of our products will also be subject to review as part of the NDA review process and its manufacturers subject to inspection for 
 19


compliance with device cGMPs embodied in the Quality System Regulation, or QSR. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS, and the FDA will not approve the application without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval. The FDA could also require a special warning, known as a black box warning, to be included in the product label in order to highlight a particular safety risk. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit and interpretation of clinical trial data. The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and/or the FDA requires additional testing or information. The FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. FDA will issue either an approval of the NDA or a Complete Response Letter, detailing the deficiencies and information required for reconsideration of the application. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Approved drugs that are manufactured or distributed in the United States are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims and some manufacturing and supplier changes are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for certain supplemental applications. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The FDA may also require a REMS, which could involve requirements for, among other things, a medication guide, special training for prescribers and dispensers, and patient registries. 
 In addition, entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved devices or drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. The FDA has promulgated specific requirements for drug cGMPs, device cGMPs embodied in the QSR and combination product cGMPs that, for drug/device combination products, specify the requirements within the drug cGMPs and the QSR with which manufacturers must comply. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may issue enforcement letters or withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Corrective action could delay product distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, , including without limitation the FDCA, the False Claims Act, other federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and state consumer protection laws. A company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities.

The Hatch-Waxman amendments 
 Our regulatory strategy is to pursue development of our drugs as Section 505(b)(2) NDAs under the FDCA. As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of drugs previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This type of application permits reliance for such approvals on literature or on an FDA finding of safety, effectiveness or both for an approved drug product. As such, under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA may rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant. Therefore, if we can satisfy the conditions required for a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submission, it may eliminate the need for us to conduct some of the preclinical studies or clinical trials for the new product candidate that might otherwise have been required, although the review time is not shortened. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for the new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 Orange Book listing 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify, for each patent listed in the Orange Book for the referenced drug, to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, (2) such patent has expired, (3) the date on which such patent expires or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The fourth certification described above is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. This section viii statement does not require notice to the patent holder or NDA owner. There might also be no relevant patent certification. 
 If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. Even if the 45 days expire, a patent infringement lawsuit can be brought and could delay market entry, but it would not extend the FDA-related 30-month stay of approval. 
 The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below. 
 Non-patent exclusivity 
 In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. 
 A drug, including one approved under a 505(b)(2) application, may obtain a three-year period of non-patent market exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the three-year exclusivity period. A 505(b)(2) NDA may also be subject to a five-year exclusivity period for a new chemical entity, whereby the FDA will not accept for filing, with limited exception, a product seeking to rely upon the FDA’s findings of safety or effectiveness for such new chemical entity. 
 Orphan drugs 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or in other limited cases. Orphan drug designation does not convey any 
 21


advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan drugs are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing. In addition, an NDA for a product that has received orphan drug designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same active moiety for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as another drug’s showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different active moieties for the same indication or obtain approval for the same active moiety for a different indication. In addition, doctors may prescribe products for off-label uses and undermine our exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same active moiety for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. 
 We do not plan to pursue orphan drug designation for CLS-TA for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis in the United States. However, we may seek designation for other products in the future. We cannot guarantee that we will obtain orphan drug designation for any products in any jurisdiction. Even if we are able to obtain orphan drug designation for a product, we cannot be sure that such product will be approved, that we will be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, if ever, or that we will be able to maintain any exclusivity that is granted. 
 Foreign regulation 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and other geographies, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 Federal and state fraud and abuse, data privacy and security and transparency laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. 
 Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
 22


The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act. Several pharmaceutical, device and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses. 
 The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the criminal False Claims Act. The criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike the civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. 
 Under HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by covered entities including health care providers. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH and its implementing regulations, including the omnibus final rule published on January 25, 2013, also imposes certain obligations on the business associates of covered entities that obtain protected health information in providing services to or on behalf of covered entities. In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business. New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well. Failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. 
 Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals and/or entities. On February 8, 2013, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, released its final rule implementing the Physician Payments Sunshine Act that imposes annual reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year, and up to an aggregate of $1,105,241 per year for “knowing failures.” Any failure to comply could result in significant fines and penalties. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer and device manufacturer marketing practices or require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to particular types of healthcare professionals and entities. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our current or future business activities, including certain clinical research, sales and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The heightening compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions could increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health care laws or regulations described above that are applicable to us, or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including 
 23


potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Coverage and reimbursement 
 The physicians who use our product candidates, if approved, may be reimbursed by third-party payors for both the suprachoroidal injection using our SCS Microinjector and for the drug itself. On July 1, 2016, the American Medical Association, or AMA, approved a new Category III Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code for the suprachoroidal injection of pharmacologic agents. Category III codes are a set of temporary codes maintained by the AMA for emerging technology, services and procedures. Payment for these services or procedures are based on the coverage policies of individual payors, including private insurers and government-funded programs, like Medicare, and Medicare administrative contractors. CPT code 0465T became effective on January 1, 2017. We intend to seek a separate Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, or HCPCS, code as maintained by CMS for the drug itself. We believe that separate CPT and HCPCS codes will help payors differentiate our drug candidates from other drugs currently on the market administered through intravitreal injections, although we can provide no assurance that CMS will approve the creation of a separate HCPCS code. Additionally, there is no guarantee that these billing codes or the payment amounts, if any, associated with such codes will not change in the future. 
 Our strategy will include efforts to engage physician societies and encourage third-party payors to establish coverage, coding and payment that will facilitate access to our product candidates and SCS Microinjector as we expand our commercialization efforts in the United States. Our success in these efforts depends in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures during which our product candidates are administered and for the drugs themselves. Failure by physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and other users of our products to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from healthcare payors for the procedures administering our product candidates or for the product candidates themselves, or adverse changes in government and private third-party payors’ policies would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects. 
 In the U.S., third-party payors continue to implement initiatives that restrict the use of certain technologies to those that meet certain clinical evidentiary requirements. Failure to obtain favorable coverage policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. 
 In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, third-party payors from time to time update reimbursement amounts and also revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments to ambulatory surgery centers, hospitals and physicians for the procedure performed administering our products, which could directly impact the demand for any of our product candidates that may be approved. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program updates to physician payments, which is done on an annual basis using a prescribed statutory formula. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. However, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, ended the use of the statutory formula, and provided for a 0.5% annual increase in payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule through 2019, but no annual update from 2020 through 2025. MACRA also introduced a quality payment program under which individual providers with Medicare billings of $30,000 or 100 patient visits per year will be subject to certain incentives or penalties based on new program quality standards. The quality payment program has two tracks, one known as the merit based incentive payment system for providers in the fee-for service Medicare program, and the advanced alternative payment model for providers in specific care models, such as accountable care organizations. Payment adjustments for the Medicare quality payment program will begin in 2019. At this time it is unclear how the introduction of the quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program. Any changes in coverage and reimbursement that further restricts coverage of our products or lowers reimbursement for procedures using our products could materially affect our business. 
 Healthcare reform 
 Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products, or for the procedures associated with the use of our products, or limit coverage of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products. However, we believe that the shift away from fee-for-
 24


service agreements to capitated payment models supports the value of our products, as we believe that our products reduce longitudinal resource utilization, which can be cost saving-for both payors and providers. 
 For example, implementation of the Affordable Care Act has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. 
 The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices, established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research. In addition, the Affordable Care Act implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or BBA, among other things, amends the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. Congress could consider additional legislation to repeal or repeal and replace certain elements of the Affordable Care Act in the future. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
