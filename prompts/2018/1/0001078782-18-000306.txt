Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Axim Biotechnologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is an innovative biotechnology company focusing on research, development and production of pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmetic products, genetically controlled botanical products, and extraction and purification of cannabinoids technologies based on our proprietary technologies. We believe to be setting the standard for cannabinoid bioscience through the discovery and commercialization of new materials and technologies for healthy living. Our common stock is traded on the OTCQB under the symbol “AXIM.”
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2010 under the name AXIM International, Inc. On July 24, 2014, we changed our name to AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc. to better reflect our business operations. On August 7, 2014, we incorporated a wholly owned Nevada subsidiary named Axim Holdings, Inc. to help facilitate the business operations of the Company.
 
On May 11, 2015, we entered into a 50 year, worldwide, exclusive intellectual property licensing agreement (“Agreement”) with CanChew Biotechnologies, LLC (“CanChew”). As compensation for the Agreement, CanChew received 5,826,706 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock and a royalty fee of approximately 2-3% of all gross sales derived from products produced under the Agreement. So long as we are in compliance with the Agreement, we have the option to purchase the licensed intellectual property after 5 years at a purchase price equal to fifty percent (50%) of the annual royalty fee paid.
 
On November 15, 2014, we entered into Reservation Agreement with the City of Almere, The Netherlands, whereby we were granted an option to purchase 5,328 square meters of land in the City of Almere. We had planned to construct an office building on the site featuring: a clean laboratory zone, storage areas, office and technical rooms as well as manufacturing facility furnishings. This facility was intended to be fully compliant with GMP, GLP, FDA, EMA and ISO regulations. The purchase price for the land is 1,154,844 Euros. We have paid two reservation fees for options to purchase the property. We decided not to move ahead with the purchase of the property and recorded an expired reservation fee of $71,155. 
 
In October 2017, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary in the Netherlands for purposes of holding pharmaceutical licenses as required by the Netherlands regulations and laws. 
 
Our principal corporate headquarters are located at 45 Rockefeller Plaza, 20th Floor, Suite 83, New York, New York 10111. Our website address is www.aximbiotech.com. The information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not a part of this prospectus.

During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to: (i) filing Exchange Act reports, (ii) contractual obligations, (iii) clinical trials, and (iv) continued research and development of pharmaceutical formulations.
    We believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury, through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our shareholders, management or other investors. As of the date of the period covered by this report, we have limited cash. There are no assurances that we will be able to secure any additional funding as needed. Currently, however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing and/or related party advances; however, there is no assurance of additional funding being available.
 
We are in our early stages of development and growth, without established records of sales or earnings. We will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies.
 
Research and Development
 
We are continuing our research and development at the Free University of Amsterdam with our novel (patent pending) delivery system for treatment of patients with pain and spasticity as a sequence of Multiple Sclerosis. This study will include also the University of Plymouth, UK and academic centers in the US. The study is conducted in strict compliance with FDA/ EMA guidelines and is supervised by QPS as a CRO. The product tested is a pharmaceutical, functional chewing gum containing equal parts of THC and CBD. With our proprietary technology numerous problems related to cannabinoid’ water-insolubility due to its lipophilic nature, bypass of first-pass liver metabolism and direct delivery into the systemic circulation haves been resolved.

Clinical studies will commence at the University of Wageningen, The Netherlands testing a new (patent pending) delivery systems with novel cannabinoids for treatment of patients with IBS, IBD and Crohn’s disease. A new direct as well as controlled slow-release nano-technology delivery methods will be investigated based on our proprietary IP.
 
New, patent pending cannabinoid extraction techniques as well as pure, water soluble, freeze-dried cannabinoids are being developed in cooperation with Syncom, BV, The Netherlands, which practically solves the issue with very poor absorption of currently available, oil based cannabinoids.
 
There are numerous other R&D projects being considered involving our proprietary intellectual property. These will be strategically planned depending on availability of funds to carry on.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Currently, our intellectually property includes patents, trademarks and other proprietary, confidential and/or trade secret information. 
 Our patent applications include twelve (12) patent applications for oral care compositions, sugar alcohol kneading method, antimicrobial compositions, extraction method, cosmetic, nicotine dependence treatment gum, opioid dependence treatment gum, restless leg treatment gum, suppositories, method to treat psoriasis, method to treat atopic dermatitis, and method to treat vitiligo. Ten (10) of our patent applications have entered non-provisional stage in the U.S. and/or international stage. Our patents include two (2) patents for ophthalmic solutions and method to use the ophthalmic solution to treat glaucoma and conjunctivitis; and one (1) licensed patent (chewing gum containing cannabinoids, covering all cannabinoids, including THC). We are in the process of developing and filing more patent applications.
 
We have twenty eight (28) trademark applications some of which are registered trademarks, received Notices of Allowance, or are pending in front of the United States Patent and Trademark Office: Axim, A Axim Biotech, CanChui, Cannonich, Cannanimals, Oraximax, CannaCoal, CanShu, CanQuit, SuppoCann, OpthoCann, CannBelph, Cannocyn, ReneCann, Clean CannaCoal, CanChew Hemp CBD Gum, CanChew, HempChew, CanChew +, CanChew Plus, CanChew RX, CanChew +10, CanChew +50, CanChew +100, MedChew, MedChew GP, MedChew RL. Corresponding trademark applications have been filed in other jurisdictions for some of the marks and have received registration or are pending. Certain additional trademark applications have been filed in other jurisdictions for some of the marks and have either received registration or are pending.
 
Market, Customers and Distribution Methods
 
Our focus is on the development of innovative pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmetic products focusing on diseases and conditions for which currently there are no known efficient therapeutic ingredients or delivery systems for known active pharmaceutical ingredients. The body of knowledge regarding therapeutic use of cannabinoid-based formulations is steadily increasing. We plan to be an active player in this field of biosciences with our extensive R&D and pipeline of innovative products.
 
Our target customers are primarily end consumers via Internet sales, direct-to-consumer health and wellness stores, collectives, cooperatives, affiliate sales and master distributors. Secondarily, we are targeting manufacturers of products that can readily replace their raw base materials with our materials, making the products more environmentally friendly and sustainable. Next, we will target retail stores with major distribution companies who have preexisting relationships with major retail chain stores. As we continue to develop our business, these markets may change, be re-prioritized or eliminated as management responds to consumer and regulatory developments.
 
Competition
 
There are many developers of hemp-based consumer products, many of which are under-capitalized which we consider to be viable acquisition targets. There are also large, well-funded companies that currently do not offer hemp-based products but may do so in the future.
Source and Availability of Raw Materials
 
The Company currently has arrangements with multiple reputable suppliers which are expected to meet the projected needs for materials for the upcoming year. These suppliers are based in The Netherlands.

Government Regulation
 
For the first time since 1937, industrial hemp has been decriminalized at the federal level and can be grown legally in the United States, but on a limited basis. A landmark provision in the recently passed Agricultural Act of 2014 recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana. Federal law now exempts industrial hemp from U.S. drug laws in order to allow for crop research by universities, colleges and state agriculture departments. The new federal law, written by U.S. Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO) and U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), allows for agricultural pilot programs for industrial hemp “in states that permit the growth or cultivation of hemp.”
Employees
 
As of March 9, 2018, we have 6 full-time employees and 4 part-time employees. We allow and utilize the services of independent contractors. We will be considering the conversion of some of our part-time employees to full-time positions. We are currently in discussions with qualified individuals to engage them for positions in sales and marketing, research and development, and operations. Management believes the Company has good relationships with its employees.
 
Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws
 
The expense of complying with environmental regulations is of minimal consequence.
