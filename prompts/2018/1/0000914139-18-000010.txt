 Item 1.  Business.
 ﻿
 We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Florida on August 22, 1989.  We are in the business of innovating fundamental wireless hardware and software technologies and products.  We have designed and developed a consumer distributed WiFi product line that is being marketed under the brand name Milo®.  We also design and develop proprietary radio frequency (“RF”) technologies for use in wireless communication products.  We have expended significant financial and other resources to research and develop our RF technologies and to obtain patent protection for those technologies in the United States (“U.S.”) and certain foreign jurisdictions.  We believe certain patents protecting our proprietary technologies have been broadly infringed by others and therefore our business plan includes enforcement of our intellectual property rights through patent infringement litigation and licensing efforts.
 ﻿
 Based on the manner in which our management views and evaluates our operations, we have determined that our business currently operates under a single operating and reportable segment.  Refer to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for financial data including net losses from operations and total assets.

 Nasdaq Compliance
 On August 11, 2017, we received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the market value of the our listed securities (“MVLS”) had been below the minimum of $35 million required for continued inclusion on the Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2). In accordance with the notification, we were afforded 180 calendar days, or until February 7, 2018, to regain compliance.  In order to regain compliance, our MVLS needed to remain at $35 million or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days.  On February 13, 2018, we received notification that, based upon our continued non-compliance, our securities would be subject to delisting from Nasdaq unless we timely requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”).  We requested a hearing before the Panel and currently, any delisting action has been stayed pending a decision from the Panel regarding our plan to regain compliance with the MVLS or other Nasdaq listing requirements and our request for an extension of time within which to regain compliance.
 ﻿
 On March 22, 2018, we received a notice from Nasdaq stating that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for our common stock had been below the minimum of $1.00 per share required for continued inclusion on Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The notification letter stated that we would be afforded 180 calendar days (until September 18, 2018) to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.  In order to regain compliance, the bid price for shares of our common stock must close at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days.  The notification letter also states that in the event we do not regain compliance within the 180 day period, we may be eligible for additional time to the extent we meet the other listing requirements.

 ParkerVision v. Apple and Qualcomm (Middle District of Florida)
 On March 8, 2018, the district court in the middle district of Florida denied a motion filed by Qualcomm to transfer the case to the southern district of California.   The court also denied a motion filed by Apple to dismiss the case for improper venue.  We are awaiting a revised court schedule for the proceedings, including the claim construction hearing that was originally scheduled for January 2018.
 ﻿
 General Development of Business  
 ﻿
 Our core business since 2005 has been focused on the development of wireless technologies.  Our technologies represent among other things, unique, proprietary methods for processing RF waveforms in wireless applications. Our technologies apply to both transmit and receive functions of transmitters, receivers, and transceivers as well as other related RF communications functions. A portion of our transmit technology is marketed as Direct2Power™, or d2p™, and enables the transformation of a baseband data signal to an RF carrier waveform, at the desired RF power output level, in a single unified operation. A portion of our receiver technology is marketed as Direct2Data™, or d2d™, and enables the direct conversion of an RF carrier to a baseband data signal, as well as enabling the direct conversion of a baseband signal to a modulated RF carrier signal.  This technology is also referred to as energy transfer sampling down conversion for receivers and/or pulse-shaping up conversion for transmitters.  We have developed these and a number of additional innovations which are protected by the intellectual property we have secured in various patent families for RF and related functions in RF-based communications.

For a number of years, we marketed our RF technologies and integrated circuit products for use in mobile products and applications.  Our lack of tenure in the mobile handset industry coupled with the unique nature of our technology resulted in lengthy and intense technology evaluation and due diligence efforts by potential customers. Furthermore, in order to utilize our technology in a mobile handset application, we were reliant upon the provider of the baseband processor that generates the data to be transmitted or received by our RF chipsets.  Although our technology is capable of interfacing with any baseband processor, the development of the interface between the baseband processor and our chipset requires a cooperative effort with the baseband provider. Accordingly, our marketing efforts were dependent on the activities of third parties. In addition, we believe our technology has been broadly infringed by others thereby reducing the competitive advantage of our technologies. We believe these factors hindered our sales efforts, particularly in markets for portable and consumer wireless applications such as mobile Smartphones and tables.
 ﻿
 In 2011, through analysis of conference papers and tear down reports, we concluded that Qualcomm’s products were infringing our energy transfer sampling down conversion technology.  Based on our belief that our technology is widely-deployed in the mobile handset market as a result of infringement of our patents, we began to more vigorously pursue an intellectual property licensing strategy which included enforcement actions. We filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Qualcomm in July 2011.  Although this case resulted in a $173 million jury award in 2013 for Qualcomm’s infringement of several of our patents, the jury’s decision was ultimately overturned by the district court judge, a decision that was later upheld on appeal.  Despite the courts’ decisions in this Qualcomm action, we continue to believe that certain of our technologies are broadly infringed and have wide-spread application in the industry.  
 ﻿
 From 2014 through 2017, we pursued licensing opportunities for our technologies, including through additional litigation where we deemed necessary to protect our patent rights.  These efforts resulted in a patent license and settlement agreement with Samsung in 2016.  We currently have ongoing patent infringement actions against Qualcomm, Apple and LG in both the U.S. and Germany as well as an action against HTC in the U.S.  See “Legal Proceedings” in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for a full discussion of our patent-related litigation activities.  A significant portion of our litigation costs in 2017 and 2016 were funded under a secured contingent payment arrangement with Brickell Key Investments (“BKI”) and other contingent arrangements with our legal counsel.  See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 8 for a full discussion of our litigation funding arrangements.  
 ﻿
 In addition to our patent enforcement activities, from 2013 through 2017, we also designed and developed products that included integrated circuits (“ICs”) based on our proprietary technologies as well end-user WiFi products aimed at the home and small business networking market.  These product development efforts culminated in the launch of our Milo brand product line, which began selling in October 2017.
 ﻿
 We anticipate our future business will include continued expansion of our Milo product line to include additional complimentary products as well as expanded features and functionality of the current products.  Our expansion is expected to result both from internally-developed components, products and features as well as through the acquisition of complimentary business and/or product lines or through joint venture opportunities.    We also anticipate a continued focus on licensing our intellectual property for incorporation into wireless devices designed and manufactured by others.

Our technology is capable of being incorporated for any of the mobile handset standards, as well as a variety of other communications protocols, including WiFi.  By pursuing both licensing and product opportunities, we believe our technologies can be deployed in multiple markets that incorporate RF transmitters, receivers, and/or transceivers, including mobile handsets, tablets, femtocells, digital television, machine-to-machine, RF identification, cable modems, satellite communication, and infrastructure, among others.  In order to secure proper compensation for the unauthorized use of our technologies by others, our licensing efforts also include enforcement actions against parties in some of these markets who we believe have already deployed products that infringe certain of our patented technologies.    ﻿
 Milo WiFi Products
 ﻿
 Product Offerings
 Our Milo-branded WiFi product line is a cost-effective networking system that enhances WiFi connectivity by effectively distributing the WiFi signal from existing routers and modems throughout a broader coverage area, eliminating WiFi dead zones and creating a more even distribution of data rates across the coverage area.  Our product offering currently includes a two-unit system designed for coverage areas of up to 2,000 square feet and a three-unit system designed for coverage areas of up to 4,000 square feet.  The Milo system can connect to an existing router via Ethernet cable.  Alternatively, the system can connect to the router wirelessly through our BaseLink technology thus enabling the Milo user to eliminate redundancy of coverage from an existing router while also optimizing and maximizing the overall coverage area. Our embedded SmartSeek intelligence enables the Milo system to delegate signal communication across multiple radios in each Milo unit, thereby optimizing the network path for each unique environment.  The systems are supported by easy-to-use mobile applications for both Apple and Android devices to enhance the overall customer experience.      Markets
 Our goal is to provide a cost-effective product solution for inadequate WiFi coverage for consumers, small businesses and certain vertical markets, such as internet service providers.  The growing number of internet-connected devices, including smart phones, laptops, tablets, Smart Home, and Internet of Things (“IoT”) devices such as Smart TVs, security cameras, thermostat controls, game consoles, etc., have increased the need for more robust and reliable networking solutions.  Internet connections are being upgraded through high-speed broadband technologies in order to address more complex applications and rich multimedia content.  Meanwhile, users want the convenience and flexibility of operating truly mobile devices.   As a result, the need for more convenience, broader coverage, and increased reliability of residential and small business WiFi networks is increasing demand for wireless networking products.  
 ﻿
 Sales Channels
 We began selling our Milo WiFi products in the U.S. in 2017 primarily through Amazon.com and our own online store.    In 2018, we began expanding our online sales channels to include Walmart.com and NeweggBusiness.com.  We will be further expanding our sales channels to include additional online retailers and wholesale distributors, including consignment arrangements.  The wholesale distributors are expected to supply products to additional online retail channels and internet service providers.   In addition, we are marketing our products and related services directly to internet service providers in the U.S.  We also anticipate expansion of our sales channels into Canada and Europe in 2018.  Amazon.com accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Integrated Circuit Products
 ﻿
 Our PV5870 IC is a modulator/demodulator component based on our proprietary technologies and targeted for markets that use less integrated RF transceivers than those used by the mobile handset market, such as infrastructure, industrial and military applications. We sell our PV5870 IC through a distribution relationship with RFMW, Ltd.  Our sales of these ICs have been minimal to date.
 ﻿
 In August 2017, we completed initial prototypes of our PV6870 IC, a complete single chip WiFi solution intended for sale to product manufacturers who want to incorporate WiFi wireless connectivity into their products.  These ICs were developed in connection with third-parties and incorporate our RF technologies.  Due to our limited resources, we decreased our investment commitment toward this product late in 2017 but expect to continue to pursue this design in 2018.
 ﻿
 Production and Supply  
 ﻿
 We purchase several key components for our products from third-party suppliers, including contract manufacturers, on a purchase order basis. Our components generally have multiple sources of supply; however some components are designed specifically for our products and, in some cases, require specialty tooling.  Our third-party suppliers generally purchase the materials for these components on our behalf on a purchase order basis.  Lead times for our component products are generally 60 to 90 days without incurring additional costs for expediting.  If our suppliers fail to satisfy our supply requirements, or we fail to adequately anticipate demand for our product, our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries would be impaired and we may lose sales and experience increased component costs.  To mitigate our supply risk, we maintain an inventory of component and finished product inventory.
 ﻿
 We have produced ICs through fabrication relationships with IBM Microelectronics (“IBM”) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (“TSMC”).  In addition, we own the tooling for fabrication of our PV5870 IC.  Given the limited sales to date of our PV5870 ICs, we do not anticipate additional fabrication of this product in the foreseeable future.  
 ﻿
 Competitive Position  
 ﻿
 We operate in a highly competitive industry against companies with greater brand recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, and sales and marketing resources.  As a result, they may have larger distribution channels and greater reach to customers than we do. 
 ﻿
 Our WiFi products compete with WiFi networking products offered by companies such as Google, Belkin/Linksys, NetGear, Eero, and others.  We also expect to face competition from service providers who bundle competing networking devices with their service offering if we are not the supplier of choice for those service providers.  We believe the principal competitive factors in the markets for our networking products include product performance, ease-of-installation, price, customer support, brand and the breadth of sales channels.  To compete, we must continue to invest in developing new products and features, expanding our sales channels and maintaining superior customer support.  
 ﻿

Our technologies and IC products face competition from incumbent providers of transceivers, such as Broadcom, Fujitsu, Intel, MediaTek, NVidia, Qualcomm, STMicroelectronics, Marvell, Texas Instruments, and others, as well as incumbent providers of power amplifiers, including companies such as Anadigics, Qorvo, and Skyworks, among others.  Each of our competitors, however, also has the potential of becoming a licensing or product customer for our technologies.  To date, we are unaware of any competing or emerging RF technologies, other than infringing products that provide all the simultaneous benefits that certain of our technologies enable.  Our unique technologies process RF carriers in a more optimal manner than prior traditional technologies, thereby allowing the creation of handsets and other products that have extended battery life, lower operating temperatures, more easily incorporate multiple air interface standards and frequencies in smaller form factors, improve operational performance, and reduce manufacturing costs.  One or more of these benefits enable some of the key features that can be found in high volume wireless products.  Our technologies provide such attractive benefits, in part, because of their unique operational and/or circuit architectures.  The benefits our technologies enable include highly accurate transmission and reception of RF carriers that use less power than traditional architectures and components, thereby extending battery life, reducing heat and enabling certain size, cost, performance, and packaging advantages.  
 ﻿
 We believe the most significant hurdle to the licensing and/or sale of our technologies and products is the widespread use of certain of our technologies in infringing products produced by companies with significantly greater financial, technical and sales and marketing resources.  We believe we can gain adoption and/or secure licensing agreements with unauthorized current users of one or more of our technologies, and therefore compete, based on a solid and defensible patent portfolio and the advantages enabled by our unique circuit architectures.  
 ﻿
 Patents and Trademarks 
 ﻿
 We consider our intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trademarks, and trade secrets to be significant to our competitive positioning.  We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the U.S. and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products.  As of December 31, 2017, we had 198 U.S. and 36 foreign patents related to our RF technologies.  In addition, we have approximately 30 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending.  We estimate the economic lives of our patents to be fifteen to twenty years and our current portfolio of issued patents have expirations ranging from 2018 to 2034.
 ﻿
 Research and Development  
 ﻿
 We have made significant investments in research and development in order to develop existing and new technologies in-house and to evaluate and test existing and new third-party technologies.  Our research and development efforts have included the development and advancement of RF technologies, including the development of prototype ICs and related software interfaces, development and testing of our networking products, including the operating system software and mobile applications for those products, and the creation of test programs for quality control testing of our products.  For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we spent approximately $4.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively, on Company-sponsored research and development activities.
 ﻿
 Sales, Marketing and Customer Support
 ﻿
 We support our sales channels through advertising, online promotions, and video testimonials and demonstrations.   Our sales and marketing team, which includes both in-house and outside resources, focuses on brand development, product strategy, the new product introduction process, demand

assessment, and competitive analysis as well as channel expansion including direct sales to internet service providers.  This team is also responsible for driving the traditional and digital marketing strategies and public relations.  
 ﻿
 Consumers often lack the technical knowledge and resources to implement advanced technologies. Therefore a customer-friendly installation experience is an important factor for this market.   Our systems are designed with the consumer experience in mind.   In addition, we have an internal, U.S.-based customer support group that provides support to those customers who have more complex environments or desire additional support.  We provide customer support through a variety of channels including phone, chat, social media and email.   Our support team also manages our technical support knowledge base for self-help customers and gathers customer feedback that is used to enhance our future product offerings.  We believe an outstanding customer service experience is a differentiating factor for our products.  
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 45 full-time and 5 part-time employees, including 18 in research and development, 12 in sales, marketing and customer support, 7 in operations including sourcing and production, and 13 in executive management, finance, information systems and administration.  We also utilize a number of temporary or contract staff to supplement our workforce.  Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
