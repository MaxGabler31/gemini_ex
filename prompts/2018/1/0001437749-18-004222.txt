Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for use in medically supervised settings. Our product candidates, focused on the treatment of acute pain are, DSUVIA™ (known as DZUVEO outside of the United States), and ZALVISO®, each of which utilizes sublingual sufentanil, delivered via a non-invasive route of sublingual administration, exclusively for use in medically supervised settings. We anticipate developing a distribution capability and commercial organization to market and sell DSUVIA, if approved, in the United States by ourselves, and potentially, in certain European Economic Area, or EEA, countries with strategic partners. In geographies where we decide not to commercialize ourselves, we may seek to out-license commercialization rights. We plan to resubmit the NDA for ZALVISO in the second half of 2018. If we are successful in obtaining approval of ZALVISO, we plan to potentially promote ZALVISO either by ourselves or with strategic partners. 
Product Development Programs
 
We have chosen sufentanil as the therapeutic ingredient for our current product candidates. Opioids have been utilized for pain relief for centuries and are the standard-of-care for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain. Sufentanil, a high-therapeutic index opioid, which has no active metabolites, is available as an injectable in several markets around the world and is used by anesthesiologists for induction of sedation or as an epidural; however, the injectable formulation is not suitable for the treatment of acute pain. Sufentanil has many pharmacological advantages over other opioids. Published studies demonstrate that sufentanil produces significantly less respiratory depressive effects relative to its analgesic effects compared to other opioids, including morphine and fentanyl. These third-party clinical results correlate well with preclinical trials demonstrating sufentanil’s high therapeutic index, or the ratio of the toxic dose to the therapeutic dose of a drug, used as a measure of the relative safety of the drug for a particular treatment. Accordingly, we believe that sufentanil can be developed to provide an effective and well-tolerated treatment for acute pain. The following table illustrates the difference between the therapeutic index of different opioids. 
Opioid | Therapeutic Index
--------------+------------------
Meperidine | 5 
Methadone | 12 
Morphine | 71 
Hydromorphone | 250 
Fentanyl | 277 
Sufentanil | 26,716 

 
In addition, the pharmaceutical attributes of sufentanil, including lipid solubility and ionization, result in rapid cell membrane penetration and onset of action, which we believe make sufentanil an optimal opioid for the treatment of acute pain.
 
Although the analgesic efficacy and safety of sufentanil have been well established, the product’s use has been historically limited due to its short duration of action when delivered intravenously. Sublingual delivery of sufentanil avoids the high peak plasma levels and short duration of action of intravenous, or IV, administration.

We have created a proprietary sublingual (under the tongue) formulation of sufentanil intended for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain. We believe our non-invasive, proprietary sublingual sufentanil tablet potentially overcomes many of the limitations of current treatment options available for moderate-to-severe acute pain. The sublingual formulation retains the therapeutic value of sufentanil and novel delivery devices provide a non-invasive route of administration. Sufentanil is highly lipophilic which provides for rapid absorption in the mucosal tissue, or fatty cells, found under the tongue, and for rapid transit across the blood-brain barrier to reach the mu-opioid receptors in the brain. The sublingual route of delivery used by DSUVIA and ZALVISO provides a predictable onset of analgesia. The sublingual delivery system also eliminates the risk of intravenous, or IV, complications, such as catheter-related infections. In addition, because patients do not require direct connection to an IV infusion pump, or IV line, DSUVIA and ZALVISO may allow for ease of patient mobility. 
 

Summary of our Product Candidates 
 
The following table summarizes key information about our existing product candidates.
 

Product Candidate | Description | Target Use | Status 
---------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSUVIA™ (sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg)
 
   

None of our product candidates have been approved by the FDA, although ZALVISO has been approved in the EU. To date, we have received minimal revenue from the sale of ZALVISO in the EU.

 

DSUVIA is a non-invasive investigational product candidate consisting of 30 mcg sufentanil tablets delivered sublingually by a healthcare professional using a disposable, pre-filled, single-dose applicator, or SDA. We are developing DSUVIA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain to be administered by a healthcare professional to a patient in medically supervised settings. If approved, examples of potential patient populations and settings in which DSUVIA could be used include: emergency room patients; patients who are recovering from short-stay or ambulatory surgery and do not require more long-term analgesia; post-operative patients who are transitioning from the operating room to the recovery floor; certain types of office-based or hospital-based procedures; patients being treated and transported by paramedics; and for battlefield casualties. In the emergency room and in ambulatory care environments, patients often do not have immediate IV access available, or maintaining IV access may provide an impediment to rapid discharge. Moreover, IV dosing results in high peak plasma levels, thereby limiting the opioid dose and requiring frequent redosing intervals to titrate to satisfactory analgesia. Oral pills and liquids generally have slow and erratic onset of analgesia. Based on internal market research conducted to date, we believe that additional treatment options are needed that can safely and effectively treat acute trauma pain, in both civilian and military settings, and that can provide an alternative to currently marketed oral pills and liquids, as well as IV-administered opioids, for moderate-to-severe acute pain.

The potential benefits of DSUVIA are the result of combining the following three elements: 
 

• | sufentanil, a high therapeutic index opioid;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | our proprietary, non-invasive sublingual dosage form; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | a disposable, pre-filled SDA that enables simple administration of sufentanil sublingual tablets in medically supervised settings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSUVIA utilizes sufentanil, which has one of the highest therapeutic indices of all commercially available opioids, making it an attractive candidate for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain. Formulated in our proprietary sublingual tablet dosage form, sufentanil provides for relatively high bioavailability, with lower peak drug levels and a longer duration of action compared to IV delivery.
 
With the completion of the clinical program for DSUVIA, and the positive data obtained from all the clinical studies, we submitted an NDA under section 505(b)(2) with the FDA for DSUVIA for the treatment of adult patients experiencing moderate-to-severe acute pain in a medically supervised setting. The NDA contained the results of the entire DSUVIA clinical program, including data from four (three Phase 3 and one Phase 2) clinical trials in which DSUVIA was assessed as a treatment for moderate-to-severe acute pain in post-operative and emergency department patients. In each of these clinical studies, patients treated with DSUVIA demonstrated mean improvements in pain intensity as early as 15-to-30 minutes after the start of dosing. Adverse events reported in the studies were typical of opioid therapy, with the most common being nausea, headache, vomiting and dizziness. 
 
On October 12, 2017, we received a CRL from the FDA regarding the DSUVIA NDA which stated that the FDA determined it could not approve the NDA in its present form and provided recommendations for resubmission. The CRL contained two primary recommendations. First, while the safety database was suitable in number of patients, the collection of additional data was requested on at least 50 patients to assess the safety of DSUVIA dosed at the maximum amount described in the proposed label. Second, to ensure proper administration of the tablet with the SDA, the FDA recommended certain changes to the Directions for Use, or DFU, to address use-related errors, which changes should be validated through a Human Factors, or HF, study. We had a Type A post-action meeting with the FDA on January 26, 2018 to discuss the topics covered in the CRL and to clarify the path to move towards resubmission of the DSUVIA NDA. We expect to resubmit the NDA in the second quarter of 2018 after completing an HF study to validate the revised DFU.
 
On May 11, 2015, we entered into an award contract (referred to as the DoD Contract) supported by the Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine Research Program, or CRMRP, of the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, or USAMRMC, within the U.S. Department of Defense, or the DoD, in which the DoD agreed to provide up to $17.0 million to support the development of DSUVIA. Under the terms of the DoD Contract, the DoD reimbursed us for costs incurred for development, manufacturing, regulatory and clinical costs outlined in the DoD Contract, including reimbursement for certain personnel and overhead expenses. The period of performance under the DoD Contract began on May 11, 2015. The DoD Contract gives the DoD the option to extend the term and provide additional funding. On March 2, 2016, the DoD Contract was amended to approve enrollment of additional patients in the SAP302 study, approve the addition of the SAP303 study, and extend the DoD Contract period of performance by four months from November 10, 2016 to March 9, 2017, to accommodate the increased SAP302 patient enrollment and the SAP303 study. The costs for these changes were included within the current DoD Contract value. On March 9, 2017, the DoD Contract was amended to incorporate additional activities including the development and testing of packaging changes; and additional stability testing. The amendment also extended the DoD Contract period of performance by 11 months through February 28, 2018 to accommodate these additional activities. At December 31, 2017, the additional activities as outlined under the DoD Contract through February 28, 2018 were substantially complete. On February 28, 2018, the DoD contract was amended to incorporate additional services in the amount of $0.5 million and to extend the contract period by twelve months through February 28, 2019. If DSUVIA is approved by the FDA, the DoD has the option to purchase 112,000 units of commercial product pursuant to the terms of the DoD Contract. 
 
In March 2017, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, notified us that the Marketing Authorisation Application, or MAA, for DZUVEO (sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg) for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain in a medically supervised setting has passed validation, and that the scientific review of the MAA is underway. We anticipate an opinion on the MAA from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, in the first half of 2018. We held various meetings with Health Authorities in Europe, including from Iceland and Hungary who have been designated as rapporteur and co-rapporteur, respectively, prior to the submission of the MAA. Based on feedback from these discussions, we submitted a hybrid application for a label indication for DZUVEO in the EU for acute moderate-to-severe pain in adult patients in medically supervised settings. At the time of the MAA submission, we had completed one study in the emergency room for acute pain patients, in addition to two Phase 3 and one Phase 2 post-operative pain studies. We may need an additional controlled study in the emergency department with DZUVEO to obtain a label that includes trauma-related pain in addition to post-operative pain. We also anticipate we may need comparator studies in the EU to ensure premium reimbursement in certain countries.

ZALVISO® (sufentanil sublingual tablet system) 
 

None of our product candidates have been approved by the FDA, although ZALVISO has been approved in the EU. To date, we have received minimal revenue from the sale of ZALVISO in the EU

 

ZALVISO is intended for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in hospitalized adult patients. ZALVISO consists of a pre-filled cartridge of 40 sufentanil sublingual tablets, 15 mcg, delivered by the ZALVISO System, a needle-free, handheld, patient-administered, pain management system. While still under development in the U.S., as discussed further below, ZALVISO is approved and marketed in the EU.
 
ZALVISO is a pre-programmed non-invasive system to allow hospital patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain to self-dose with sufentanil sublingual tablets, 15 mcg, to manage their pain. ZALVISO is designed to help address certain problems associated with post-operative IV patient-controlled analgesia, or PCA. ZALVISO allows patients to self-administer sufentanil sublingual tablets via a pre-programmed, secure system designed in part to eliminate the risk of healthcare provider programming errors. 
 
The potential benefits of ZALVISO are the result of combining the following three elements: 
 

• | sufentanil, a high therapeutic index opioid;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | sufentanil sublingual tablets, our proprietary, non-invasive sublingual dosage form; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our novel, pre-programmed, handheld PCA device that enables simple patient-controlled delivery of sufentanil sublingual tablets in the hospital setting and eliminates the risk of programming errors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ZALVISO allows patients to self-administer sufentanil sublingual tablets as needed to manage their moderate-to-severe acute pain in the hospital setting, and provides the record-keeping attributes of a conventional IV PCA pump while avoiding some of the key issues, such as programming errors, associated with conventional IV PCA use. 
ZALVISO utilizes sufentanil, which has one of the highest therapeutic indices of all commercially available opioids, making it an attractive candidate for the management of post-operative pain. Formulated in our proprietary sublingual tablet dosage form, sufentanil provides for relatively high bioavailability, with lower peak drug levels and a longer duration of action compared to IV delivery.

The ZALVISO System consists of the following components: a disposable dispenser tip (Figure A); a disposable dispenser cap (Figure B); an adhesive thumb tag (Figure C); a cartridge of 40 sufentanil sublingual 15 mcg tablets (approximately a two-day supply) in a disposable radio frequency identification and bar-coded cartridge (Figure D); a reusable, rechargeable handheld controller (as pictured, nurse-side view) (Figure E); a tether (Figure F); and an authorized access card (Figure G). 
 

None of our product candidates have been approved by the FDA, although ZALVISO has been approved in the EU. To date, we have received minimal revenue from the sale of ZALVISO in the EU.
 
Drugs are classified or scheduled by the Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, according to their potential for abuse and addiction. Sufentanil is scheduled as a class II opioid. Scheduled drugs, when they are under patient control in a hospital setting, must be secured and have adequate dose access control and tracking mechanisms. Our novel handheld PCA device has the following safety features:
 

• | an authorized access card, which is a wireless system access key for the healthcare professional;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a wireless, electronic, adhesive thumb tag that acts as a single-patient identification key;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pre-programmed 20-minute lock-out to avoid overdosing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | tablet singulation, or dispensing, motion that eliminates runaway motor delivery risk;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a security tether that is designed to prevent theft and misuse; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fully automated inventory record of sufentanil sublingual tablet usage.

On December 16, 2013, AcelRx and Grünenthal GmbH, or Grünenthal, entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the License Agreement, and related Manufacture and Supply Agreement, or the MSA, and together with the License Agreement, the Agreements. The License Agreement grants Grünenthal rights to commercialize ZALVISO, our novel sublingual PCA system, or the Product, in the countries of the EU, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway and Australia, or the Territory, for human use in pain treatment within, or dispensed by, hospitals, hospices, nursing homes and other medically supervised settings, or the Field. We retain rights with respect to the Product in countries outside the Territory, including the United States, Asia and Latin America. Under the MSA, we will exclusively manufacture and supply the Product to Grünenthal for the Field in the Territory. Grünenthal shall purchase from us, during the first five years after the effective date of the MSA, 100% and thereafter 80% of Grünenthal’s and its sublicensees’ and distributors’ requirements of Product for use in the Field for the Territory. We entered into amendments to the License Agreement, effective July 17, 2015 and September 20, 2016, or the License Amendments, and together with the License Agreement, the Amended License Agreement, and entered into an amendment to the MSA, or the MSA Amendment, and together with the MSA, the Amended MSA, effective as of July 17, 2015, and together, the Amended Agreements. For additional information on the Amended Agreements, see Note 6 “Collaboration Agreement” in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
ZALVISO was approved for commercial sale by the European Commission in September 2015 and Grünenthal has begun its commercial launch of ZALVISO in the European Union. On September 18, 2015, we sold a majority of the expected royalty stream and commercial milestones from the sales of ZALVISO in the EU and EEA by Grünenthal to PDL, or the Royalty Monetization. For additional information on the Royalty Monetization with PDL, see Note 8 “Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties” in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Royalty revenues and non-cash royalty revenues from the commercial sales of ZALVISO in the EU are expected to be minimal for 2018.
 
We submitted an NDA for ZALVISO in September 2013, or ZALVISO NDA, and on July 25, 2014, the Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products, or the Division, of the FDA issued a CRL for the ZALVISO NDA. The CRL contained requests for additional information on the ZALVISO System to ensure proper use of the device. The requests include submission of data demonstrating a reduction in the incidence of device errors, changes to address inadvertent dosing, among other items, and submission of additional data to support the shelf life of the product. In March 2015, we received correspondence from the FDA stating that, in addition to the work we had performed to address the items in the CRL, a clinical study would be required to test the modifications to the ZALVISO device and mitigations put in place to reduce the risk of inadvertent dosing/misplaced tablets.

Our IAP312 study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of changes made to the functionality and usability of the ZALVISO device and to take into account comments from the FDA on the study protocol. In the IAP312 study, 320 hospitalized, post-operative patients used ZALVISO to self-administer 15 mcg sublingual sufentanil tablets as often as once every 20 minutes for 24-to-72 hours to manage their moderate-to-severe acute pain. Throughout the study, for which top-line results were announced in August 2017, 2.2% of patients experienced a ZALVISO device error, which was statistically less than the 5% limit specified in the study objectives. None of these device errors resulted in an over-dosing event. This 2.2% rate was lower (p < 0.001) than the 7.9% rate of device errors during patient use previously reported for the earlier version of the ZALVISO device in the Phase 3 IAP311 study. In addition, results of this study supported earlier clinical findings, with favorable tolerability and a significant majority of “good” or “excellent” ratings provided by both patients and healthcare providers when assessing the method of pain control. We intend to submit these results, together with our earlier Phase 3 studies (IAP309, IAP310 and IAP311), all of which met safety and efficacy endpoints, as part of our resubmission of the NDA for ZALVISO in the second half of 2018.

Multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (SAP301)
 
In September 2015, we reported that SAP301, a pivotal Phase 3 multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of DSUVIA that evaluated the efficacy and safety of DSUVIA vs. placebo for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain following ambulatory abdominal surgery, met its primary and secondary endpoints. Results demonstrated that patients receiving DSUVIA administered via a disposable, pre-filled SDA experienced significantly greater pain reduction compared to placebo, as measured by the Summed Pain Intensity Difference to baseline over 12 hours, or SPID-12, (p<0.001). Adverse events related to study drug were typical of opioid therapy and were similar for patients treated with DSUVIA and placebo, the most common of which were nausea (29%) and headache (12%). 
 
The Phase 3 SAP301 trial enrolled adult patients undergoing outpatient abdominal surgery procedures at four clinical sites in the United States. Following surgery, 163 patients were randomized to receive either DSUVIA, or placebo, in a 2:1 active to placebo ratio. DSUVIA, or placebo, was administered by site staff as requested by the patient, but not more than once per hour. The intent-to-treat, or ITT, population in this study averaged 40.9 years of age with an average Body Mass Index of 27.5, and had a higher percent of females to males (68%:32%). Eighty-nine percent of patients entering the study completed the 24-hour study period. 
 
The primary endpoint of the study was the difference in the SPID-12 score of patients receiving DSUVIA compared to those receiving placebo. SPID‑12 scores were +25.8 for DSUVIA-treated patients and +13.1 for placebo-treated patients; the difference between the two groups being highly statistically significant (p<0.001). Notably, the difference in pain intensity from baseline was superior for DSUVIA over placebo at the earliest time point measured (15 minutes; p=0.002). Secondary efficacy endpoints were also superior for DSUVIA compared to placebo. 
 
There were two SAEs reported during the study period, both of which were in the placebo group and resulted in early termination of the affected patients. No patient in the DSUVIA group dropped out of the study prior to 24 hours due to an adverse event. A lower percent of patients treated with DSUVIA dropped out of the study prior to 24 hours due to lack of efficacy compared to the placebo group (3.7% and 18.5%, respectively; p=0.002).
 
Multi-center, single-arm, open-label study (SAP302)
 
Results from the single-arm, open-label Phase 3 SAP302 trial, which assessed DSUVIA in patients who presented to the emergency room with moderate-to-severe acute pain associated with trauma or injury, were reported in August 2016. Overall, the 76 adults treated with DSUVIA in the SAP302 study experienced a mean pain intensity difference to baseline, or PID, of 2.9 from a baseline of 8.1, or 35%, on a 0 – 10 numeric rating scale at 60 minutes. In addition, DSUVIA demonstrated a predicted onset of activity in patients enrolled in SAP302. Patients reported a mean pain intensity decrease of 1.1 compared to baseline 15 minutes following first administration of DSUVIA and a decrease of 1.9 after 30 minutes. 
 
DSUVIA was well tolerated in the SAP302 study, with 79% of patients reporting no adverse events. The most common related adverse events reported in the study occurred with single-digit rates – nausea (7%) and vomiting (4%). All these events were rated as mild with the exception of one event of moderate nausea. Drug-induced cognitive impairment was not seen with DSUVIA in this study as assessed using the validated Six-Item Screener, an instrument used to identify patients with cognitive impairment. 
 
Multi-center, single-arm, open-label study (SAP303)
 
Results from the SAP303 clinical trial, which allowed for administration of DSUVIA for up to 12 hours in 140 patients 40 years of age and older who had moderate-to-severe acute pain following a surgical procedure with general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia (except those who received intrathecal opioids), were reported in September 2016. In this study, DSUVIA was well tolerated in the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in post-operative study patients, including elderly patients and those with organ impairment. Regardless of age and organ function, approximately 2 in 3 patients had no adverse events during the study (63% of all patients, 63% of those aged ≥65 years, 62% of those with hepatic impairment, 70% of those with renal impairment). The most common related adverse events were nausea (27%) and dizziness (4%). On a global assessment of DSUVIA as a method of pain control, 90% of healthcare professionals and 87% of patients responded “good” or “excellent.” 
 
The primary efficacy variable for SAP303 was the SPID-12, and secondary efficacy variables included pain intensity by evaluation time point. In this study, DSUVIA showed a reduction in pain intensity starting at 30 minutes after the first dose, followed by 27%, 49%, and 57% reductions in mean pain intensity from a baseline mean pain score of 6.2 at 1 hour, 2 hours, and 12 hours, respectively.

The FDA also agreed to allow us to include as supporting safety information in the NDA for DSUVIA, data from 323 patients treated in the ZALVISO clinical studies who had administered two sufentanil sublingual 15 mcg tablets 20-to-25 minutes apart. We have previously completed and analyzed pharmacokinetic and modeling data, which demonstrated the equivalency of one sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg, to two sufentanil sublingual tablets, 15 mcg, taken 20-to-25 minutes apart. 
 
Placebo-controlled, dose-finding study (SAP202)
 
In April 2013, we announced top-line results demonstrating that a placebo-controlled, dose-finding, Phase 2 trial of our investigational single-dose sufentanil sublingual tablet for acute pain, DSUVIA successfully met its primary endpoint. Results demonstrated that patients receiving DSUVIA administered by a healthcare professional, no more frequently than once per hour, had significantly greater pain reduction as measured by SPID-12 than placebo-treated patients (+6.53 for DSUVIA-treated patients and -7.12 for placebo-treated patients; p=0.003). The sufentanil sublingual 20 mcg tablet-treated patients did not achieve SPID-12 scores that differentiated from placebo. Adverse events reported in the study were generally mild-to-moderate in nature, with two serious adverse events of post-surgical infection reported, both of which were determined by the investigator to be unrelated to study drug. This dose-ranging study randomized 101 patients following bunionectomy surgery in a 2:2:1 ratio to sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg, sufentanil sublingual tablet, 20 mcg, or placebo treatment arms. The intent-to-treat, or ITT, population in this study averaged 42.5 years of age and was evenly balanced for males and females (51%:49%). Ninety-one percent of patients entering the study completed the full 12-hour study period. 
 
A number of secondary endpoints were also achieved, as follows:
 
For the time-weighted sum of pain relief scores over the 12-hour study period, or TOTPAR12, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the 30 mcg group over placebo (9.73 vs. 4.37 p = 0.002). Patients treated with the 30 mcg dose of sufentanil sublingual tablet showed a rapid onset of action with a statistically significant beneficial difference in pain relief (p=0.001) and pain intensity (p<0.01) seen at 30 minutes after dosing compared to placebo. Dosing averaged every 2.4 hours over the duration of the 12-hour study. In addition, patient global assessment of the 30 mcg dose at 12 hours was superior to placebo (p=0.002) with 43.6% vs. 5.0% of the patients responding good or excellent for overall pain control. The 20 mcg dose was not significantly different from placebo for either endpoint.
 
Two SAEs, both in the 20 mcg-dose group, occurred one week after the study (surgical infections) and were deemed unrelated to study drug. All but two adverse events reported in the study were mild-to-moderate in nature with 58 patients (58%) reporting a total of 135 adverse events. The most frequently reported related adverse events for patients receiving active drug were nausea (46%) and vomiting (21%). Two patients discontinued treatment, one unrelated to study drug (anxiety/chest pain) and the other probably related to study drug (somnolence/respiratory depression); however, both patients recovered without medical intervention. 
 
ZALVISO (sufentanil sublingual tablet system) 

Active comparator trial (IAP309) 
 
In November 2012, we reported top-line data showing that ZALVISO had met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority in the Phase 3 open-label active comparator trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of ZALVISO (15 mcg/dose) to IV PCA with morphine (1mg/dose) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute post-operative pain. Utilizing a randomized, open-label, parallel group design, this trial enrolled 359 adult patients at 26 U.S. sites for the treatment of pain immediately following open-abdominal or major orthopedic surgery (hip and knee replacement). Patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with ZALVISO or IV PCA morphine and were treated for a minimum of 48 hours and up to 72 hours. 

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, abdominal surgery trial (IAP310) 
 
In March 2013, we reported top-line data results demonstrating that ZALVISO met its primary endpoint in a pivotal Phase 3 trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of ZALVISO to placebo in the management of acute post-operative pain after major open abdominal surgery. Adverse events reported in the trial were generally mild or moderate in nature and similar in both placebo and treatment groups. Utilizing a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, this Phase 3 trial enrolled 178 adult patients at 13 U.S. sites. Patients were treated for post-operative pain for a minimum of 48 hours, and up to 72 hours. Patients were randomized 2:1, with 119 patients randomized to sufentanil sublingual tablet treatment and 59 to placebo treatment. Both treatments were delivered by the patient, as needed, using ZALVISO with a 20-minute lock-out period. Patients in both groups could receive up to 2 mg morphine intravenously per hour as a rescue medication, the primary purpose of this rescue medication being to provide placebo-treated patients access to pain medication to enable them to stay in the trial as long as possible. Pre-rescue pain scores were imputed to minimize the impact of this rescue opioid on efficacy evaluations.

The primary endpoint evaluated pain intensity over the 48-hour study period compared to baseline, or Summed Pain Intensity Difference, or SPID-48, in patients following major open abdominal surgery. Patients receiving sufentanil sublingual tablets demonstrated a significantly greater SPID-48 compared to placebo-treated patients during the study period (105.6 and 55.6, respectively; p=0.001).
 
Double-blind, placebo-controlled, orthopedic surgery trial (IAP311) 
 
In May 2013, we reported top-line data results demonstrating that ZALVISO met its primary endpoint in a pivotal Phase 3 trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of ZALVISO to placebo in the management of acute post-operative pain after major orthopedic surgery. Adverse events reported in the study were generally mild or moderate in nature and were similar in both placebo and treatment groups for the majority of adverse events. Utilizing a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, this pivotal Phase 3 study enrolled 426 adult patients at 34 U.S. sites for treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain immediately following major orthopedic surgery. Seven patients did not receive study drug, resulting in 419 patients being included in the ITT population. Patients were treated for a minimum of 48 hours, and up to 72 hours. Patients were randomized 3:1, with 323 patients randomized to sufentanil sublingual tablet treatment and 104 to placebo treatment. Both treatments were delivered by the patient, as needed, using the ZALVISO System with a 20-minute lock-out period. Patients in both groups could receive up to 2 mg morphine intravenously per hour as a rescue medication, the primary purpose of this rescue medication being to enable placebo-treated patients to stay in the study. Pain scores recorded just prior to the delivery of rescue medication were gathered and imputed forward to minimize the impact of this rescue opioid on efficacy evaluations. 
 
The primary endpoint evaluated SPID-48 in patients following major orthopedic surgery. Patients receiving ZALVISO demonstrated a significantly greater SPID-48 compared to placebo-treated patients during the study period (+76.1 and -11.5, respectively; p < 0.001). Two hundred fifteen (68.3%) sufentanil sublingual tablet-treated patients completed the 48-hour study period, compared to 43 (41.3%) placebo-treated patients. Primary reasons for drop-out in the sufentanil sublingual tablet- and placebo-treated groups were adverse events (7.0% and 6.7%, respectively) and lack of efficacy (14.3% and 48.1%, respectively).
 
Two patients (one each in the sufentanil sublingual tablet group and placebo group) experienced a serious adverse event considered possibly or probably related to the study drug by the investigator.
 
Combined related adverse events for the two placebo-controlled pivotal studies (IAP310 and IAP311) compared to placebo are shown below. Only pruritus (itching) was statistically different for ZALVISO compared to placebo (p = 0.002).

Multi-center, single-arm, open-label study (IAP312)
 
IAP312 was a Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the overall performance of the ZALVISO System, in response to the CRL received from the FDA for ZALVISO. Throughout the study in 320 enrolled patients, 2.2% of patients experienced a ZALVISO device error, which was statistically less than the 5% limit specified in the study objectives. Importantly, none of these device errors resulted in an over-dosing event. This 2.2% rate was lower (p < 0.001) than the 7.9% rate of device errors during patient use previously reported for the earlier version of the ZALVISO device in the Phase 3 IAP311 study.
 
In addition, as requested by FDA, the IAP312 study prospectively evaluated the number of inadvertently misplaced tablets which occurred during patient dosing. A small number of inadvertently misplaced tablets (less than 0.1% of total dispensed tablets) was observed in the original Phase 3 studies. However, the presence of inadvertently misplaced tablets had not been routinely assessed as part of the previous protocols. Throughout the IAP312 study, patients self-administered a total of 7,293 sufentanil tablets. Per the updated ZALVISO training instructions electronically displayed on the hand-held device, 6 patients called the nurse when they failed to properly self-administer a single tablet to allow for proper retrieval and disposal of the tablet. Also, during inspection by the nurse, which occurred every two hours per protocol, a total of 7 misplaced tablets (<0.1% of total dispensed tablets) were discovered with 6 additional patients. No patient had a repeat incidence of an inadvertently misplaced tablet following re-training on the device. This combination of patient training and nurse inspection, along with the tracking features of the ZALVISO device, could potentially address the FDA's concerns regarding drug accountability.
 
Finally, in this study, 86%, 89% and 100% of patients at the 24, 48 and 72-hour time points, respectively, recorded "good" or "excellent" ratings on the patient global assessment, or PGA, of the method of pain control, which measures a patient's satisfaction with their quality of analgesia. Healthcare professional global assessment, or HPGA, of the method of pain control was similarly strong, with 91%, 95% and 100% of nurses rating ZALVISO as "good" or "excellent" over each respective 24-hour period. ZALVISO was shown to be well tolerated by study participants, with nausea, hypotension and vomiting representing the most commonly reported adverse events. A total of 5 patients experienced serious adverse events, but all were considered unrelated to study drug by investigators.
 
The Market Opportunity for DSUVIA and ZALVISO
 
Unmet Medical Need
 Settings in which patients might require the short-term management of moderate-to-severe acute pain include emergency room patients; patients who are recovering from short-stay or ambulatory surgery and do not require more long-term patient-controlled analgesia; post-operative patients who are transitioning from the operating room to the recovery floor; certain types of office-based procedures; patients being treated and transported by paramedics; and for battlefield casualties.
 
While IV opioids are currently employed to control moderate-to-severe acute pain in many of these settings, the use of IV opioids suffers from the following: 
 

• | infection risk associated with the invasive nature of IV delivery;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consumption of hospital resources including an IV pump, a bed where the patient can be monitored, and nurse time; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | possible impairment of a patient’s cognitive abilities, which can make it difficult to provide accurate medical history to physicians during evaluation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe healthcare providers and hospital administrators caring for patients in moderate-to-severe acute pain in the aforementioned medically supervised settings could significantly benefit from the following items: 
 

• | non-invasively delivered analgesic that utilizes fewer hospital resources, thereby incurring less cost;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | effective and rapid-acting pain relief with sufficient duration of effect allowing efficient treatment while assuring patient satisfaction;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pain relief that does not sacrifice cognitive function; and/or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | infection risks due to invasive routes of delivery, such as IV.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
In our clinical studies, sublingual sufentanil has demonstrated the following attributes: 
 

• | ease of administration;
--+------------------------


• | pain reduction (as much as 3-points on a validated 10-point scale) beginning as early as 15-to-30 minutes after administration;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 13




• | maintenance of cognitive function;
--+-----------------------------------


• | adverse event types similar to IV opioids, such as nausea, headache, vomiting and dizziness; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | lower percentage of patients with decreased oxygen saturation events compared to IV-PCA morphine.

 
We believe that sublingual sufentanil provides a safety, efficacy and tolerability profile enabling our product candidates to potentially replace IV opioid use in patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain in the proposed medically-supervised settings. This may be especially true for DSUVIA in the emergency medical settings in the United States, where the number of emergency departments is decreasing, resulting in an increased focus on resource management to treat a growing number of patients in an efficient manner.
 
United States Market
 According to commissioned research in 2016, we estimate that there are currently 91.9 million patients who are treated in various medically supervised settings for their moderate-to-severe acute pain which is significant enough to warrant the use of an opioid. We believe these patients may be eligible for treatment with DSUVIA, and in some cases ZALVISO, if approved in the United States. The target patient population for DSUVIA are those patients in the hospital or other medically supervised setting for less than 24 hours. The target patient population for ZALVISO are patients in a hospital setting for greater than 24 hours. Our current estimate of patients in moderate-to-severe acute pain in medically supervised settings, by setting, is as follows:

Emergency services (includes pre-hospital and Emergency Department treatment) | 51.5 million
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------
Outpatient surgery | 10.7 million
Hospital/surgery center/office-based procedures | 20.1 million
Inpatient surgery/inpatient conditions | 9.6 million 

 
The market for ZALVISO, given the target patients in a hospital setting for greater than 24 hours, is the 9.6 million inpatient surgeries and inpatient conditions above. There can be no assurance that our estimates regarding the number of patients treated in the various settings will be accurate.
 
European Market
 According to recent EU5 (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) national health statistics, 142 million patients are represented across the DZUVEO target segments annually. Each year, there are an estimated 110 million emergency attendances and 32 million surgical procedures performed each year. It is anticipated that there are 51 million patients in emergency medicine with moderate-to-severe acute pain and 16 million with moderate-to-severe acute pain following surgery each year. 
Our Strategy 
 
DSUVIA
 Our specific strategy with respect to DSUVIA is to: 
 

• | resubmit the DSUVIA NDA and then seek regulatory approval in the United States;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | further expand our relationship with our contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture and packaging of DSUVIA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | build a targeted sales force focused on the emergency room and hospitals in the United States to promote DSUVIA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | supply the DoD and other military organizations as requested and appropriate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DZUVEO
Our specific strategy with respect to DZUVEO (in territories outside of the United States) is to: 
 

• | seek regulatory approval in the EEA; and
--+-----------------------------------------


• | seek commercial partnerships for DZUVEO in countries outside of the United States.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ZALVISO
Our specific strategy with respect to ZALVISO is to: 
 

• | continue to collaborate with Grünenthal to continue to support the launch of ZALVISO in their licensed territories;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 14




• | continue to strengthen our commercial relationships for the manufacturing of the components and assembly of the ZALVISO System; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | resubmit the ZALVISO NDA and then seek regulatory approval in the United States and, if successful, potentially promote ZALVISO as a follow-on product to DSUVIA or seek a commercial partnership.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing 
 
We anticipate developing a distribution capability and commercial organization in the United States to market and sell DSUVIA in the United States. In geographies where we decide not to commercialize ourselves, we would seek to out-license commercialization rights. In executing our strategy, our goal is to have significant control over the development process and commercial execution for DSUVIA, while retaining meaningful economics. 
 
We plan to build commercial capability progressively to support introduction of DSUVIA to the United States market as we move toward potential NDA approval. We foresee two stages of commercial execution to support successful introduction of DSUVIA in the United States: 
 
First, prior to FDA approval of DSUVIA, we plan to: 
 

• | create and deploy a focused scientific support team to gather a detailed understanding of individual emergency room, and hospital needs in order to be prepared to present DSUVIA effectively at the time of commercial launch;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increase awareness of the clinical profile of sublingual administration of sufentanil through publication of our clinical data;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | engage appropriate Advisory Boards that include representative emergency room physicians, anesthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, pharmacy and therapeutics, or P&T, committee members and other related experts to provide us with input on appropriate commercial positioning for DSUVIA for each of these key audiences;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | complete planning to build a sales and marketing organization that can define appropriate segmentation and positioning strategies and tactics for DSUVIA; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | gather relevant clinical and health economic data identifying the limitations of IV opioids and other relevant treatments for moderate-to-severe acute pain in use today.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second, assuming FDA approval, we plan to: 
 

• | establish DSUVIA on hospital and ambulatory surgery center formularies through deployment of an experienced team to explain the clinical and health economic attributes of DSUVIA;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | create and progressively deploy a high-quality, customer-focused and experienced sales organization dedicated to bringing innovative, highly valued healthcare solutions to patients, payers and healthcare providers, including progressively building a targeted sales force of approximately 65 people in the United States;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | conduct post-approval clinical trials for DSUVIA;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | undertake efforts to establish DSUVIA as a suitable choice for moderate-to-severe acute pain in medically supervised settings; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expand the market through deployment of DSUVIA into other suitable medically supervised settings outside of the hospital and ambulatory surgery centers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any product revenue. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our commercialization, please see “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates” appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 
 

Collaborative Arrangements 
 
Grünenthal Collaboration 
 
On December 16, 2013, we and Grünenthal entered into the License Agreement, as amended effective July 17, 2015 and September 20, 2016, and related MSA, as amended effective July 17, 2015, together the Amended Agreements. The License Agreement grants Grünenthal rights to commercialize ZALVISO, or the Product, in the Territory for human use in pain treatment in the Field. We retain rights with respect to the Product in countries outside the Territory, including the United States, Asia and Latin America. Under the MSA, we are required to exclusively manufacture and supply the Product to Grünenthal for the Field in the Territory. 
 
 15



Under the terms of the Amended Agreements with Grünenthal, we received an upfront cash payment of $30.0 million in December 2013, a milestone payment of $5.0 million related to the MAA submission, which occurred in July 2014, and a $15.0 million milestone payment due to the EC approval of the MAA for ZALVISO in September 2015. Under the Amended License Agreement, we are eligible to receive approximately $194.5 million in additional milestone payments, based upon successful regulatory and product development efforts ($28.5 million) and net sales target achievements ($166.0 million). Grünenthal will also make tiered royalty, supply and trademark fee payments in the mid-teens up to the mid-twenties percent range, depending on the sales level achieved, on net sales of ZALVISO in the Territory. For additional information on the Amended Agreements, see Note 6 “Collaboration Agreement” in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
On September 18, 2015, we sold a majority of the expected royalty stream and commercial milestones from the sales of ZALVISO in the EU and EEA by Grünenthal to PDL, or the Royalty Monetization. We received gross proceeds of $65.0 million in the Royalty Monetization. PDL will receive 75% of the European royalties under the Amended License Agreement with Grünenthal, as well as 80% of the first four commercial milestones worth $35.6 million (or 80% of $44.5 million), subject to the capped amount of $195.0 million. For additional information on the Royalty Monetization with PDL, see Note 8 “Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties” in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
Grünenthal will be responsible for all commercial activities for ZALVISO, including obtaining and maintaining pharmaceutical product regulatory approval in the Territory. We will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining device regulatory approval in the Territory and manufacturing and supply of ZALVISO to Grünenthal for commercial sales. 
 
Intellectual Property

We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights developed internally and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. We also rely on trade secrets to protect our product candidates. Our commercial success also depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 
 
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
 

• | obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our product candidates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | defend our patents;
--+--------------------


• | preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have established and continue to build proprietary positions for our product candidates and related technology in the United States and abroad.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we are the owner of record of 22 issued U.S. patents, which together provide coverage for sufentanil sublingual tablets, and the device components of ZALVISO and the DSUVIA. These patents provide coverage through at least 2027. We also hold six issued European patents, each valid in at least eight countries in Europe. In addition, we own seven patents in Japan, seven in China and seven in Korea, and a number of other international patents which provide coverage through at least 2027. We are also pursuing a number of U.S. and foreign patent applications. The patent applications that we have filed and have not yet been granted may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the patents. 
 
We continue to seek and expand our patent protection for both compositions of matter and delivery devices, as well as methods of treatment related to our product candidates. In particular, we are pursuing additional patent protection for our ZALVISO and DSUVIA formulations, our ZALVISO device, the combination of drugs and our ZALVISO device, our DSUVIA SDA, as well as to methods of treatment using such drug and device compositions. 
 
We have filed for additional patent coverage in the United States, Europe as well as many other foreign jurisdictions including, Japan, China, India, Canada and Korea. If issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, we expect that these patents will expire between 2027 and 2030, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions in the United States. We note that the patent laws of foreign countries differ from those in United States, and the degree of protection afforded by foreign patents may be different from the protection offered by U.S. patents. 
 
 16



Further, we seek trademark protection in the United States and internationally where available and when appropriate. We have registered our ACELRX mark in Class 5, “Pharmaceutical preparations for treating pain; pharmaceutical preparations for treating anxiety,” and Class 10, “Drug delivery systems; medical device, namely, a mechanical and electronic device used to administer medications, perform timed medication delivery, and to provide secure access to and delivery of medications,” in the United States. 
 
Our ACELRX mark is also registered in the European Community, Canada, and India. 
 

Competition 
 
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and medical technology companies. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are the safety, efficacy and tolerability profile, the patient and healthcare professional satisfaction with using our product candidates in relation to available alternatives and the reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement of our product candidates. Over the past year, we have monitored changes in the pharmaceutical industry in response to opioid use in the United States. Pharmaceutical companies engaged in the distribution and sale of opioids, in particular for the treatment of chronic pain, are refocusing their efforts in order to support responsible opioid use. For example, Purdue Pharma recently announced that they will no longer be using their field sales organization to promote their opioid products; rather, requests for information will be directed to their medical affairs department. While our product candidates are designed for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain for use in medically supervised settings, rather than for the treatment of chronic pain or for outpatient use, these industry changes could impact the development and commercial success of DSUVIA or ZALVISO, if approved in the United States.
 
Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or may be more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize, which may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover our losses. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. 
 
Potential Competition for DSUVIA

There are a wide variety of approved injectable and oral opioid products to treat moderate-to-severe acute pain, including IV opioids such as morphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone and meperidine or oral opioids such as oxycodone and hydrocodone. DSUVIA does not require placement of an IV line and therefore direct competitors in the emergency department are other non-invasive, rapid-acting analgesics. In this environment, DSUVIA may compete with Egalet Corporation’s SPRIX (intranasal ketorolac). Transmucosal fentanyl products, such as ACTIQ or FENTORA (Cephalon, Inc., a subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Products Ltd.), are approved for opioid-tolerant patients suffering from cancer pain and therefore are not a competitor for DSUVIA. Orally administered tablets or liquids containing oxycodone or hydrocodone often have slower absorption and slower analgesic onset than transmucosal opioids. Examples of oral opioids include, Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s OXAYDO, (marketed by Egalet Corporation), Collegium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s NUCYNTA, and Purdue Pharma, L.P.’s OXYFAST, or generic oral opioids which have moderate-to-severe acute pain labeling. 
 
Often used in combination with opioids are generic injectable local anesthetics such as bupivacaine, or branded formulations thereof, including Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s EXPAREL. In addition, Heron Therapeutics, Inc. is in Phase 3 development of HTX-011, a long-acting formulation of the local anesthetic bupivacaine in a fixed-dose combination with the anti-inflammatory meloxicam for the prevention of post-operative pain. These products may reduce the amount of opioids required to achieve adequate pain control but usually do not obviate the need for opioids completely. Similarly, there are many IV formulations of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for treatment of acute pain, such as generic IV ketorolac, Pfizer’s DYLOJECT, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s CALDOLOR and recently Recro Pharma, Inc. submitted an NDA for IV meloxicam for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain. These products are all invasively administered via an IV and, as a result, we do not believe they are direct competitors to the non-invasive DSUVIA. 

Potential Competition for ZALVISO

We are developing ZALVISO for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in adult patients during hospitalization. We believe that ZALVISO would compete with a number of opioid-based and non-opioid based treatment options that are currently available, as well as some products that are in development. The hospital market for opioids for moderate-to-severe acute pain is large and competitive. These products can be grouped into three classes – PCA-based systems, most commonly using an opioid as the pain control agent; non PCA-based systems that require nurse delivery of oral or parenteral opioids; and other non-opioid based treatment modalities. Due to the difficulty of managing moderate-to-severe acute pain, healthcare professionals will often use a combination of PCA opioids, parenteral or oral opioids and non-opioid based treatments to manage pain. 
 
 17



We believe that ZALVISO would compete with a number of opioid-based and non-opioid based treatment options that are currently available, as well as some products that are in development. The hospital market for opioids for moderate-to-severe acute pain is large and competitive. The primary competition for ZALVISO is the IV PCA pump, which is widely used in the moderate-to-severe acute pain in the hospital setting. Leading manufacturers of IV PCA pumps include Hospira, Inc. (sold by Pfizer, Inc. to ICU Medical), CareFusion Corporation (purchased by Becton, Dickinson and Company), Baxter International, Inc., Curlin Medical, Inc. and Smiths Medical. The most common opioids used to treat moderate-to-severe acute pain are morphine, hydromorphone and fentanyl, all of which are available as generics both from generic product manufacturers as well as from compounding pharmacies. In addition, branded manufacturers (e.g., Hospira, Inc.) sell pre-filled glass syringes of morphine to fit their IV PCA pump systems. These systems, however, are invasive and require programming, which can lead to dosing errors, and therefore, while they are commonly used, we do not believe they are direct competitors for ZALVISO. Also available on the market is the Avancen Medication on Demand, or MOD, an oral PCA device developed by Avancen MOD Corporation. Oral opioids and other agents can be used in this system. Oral opioids tend to have slower onset than transmucosal opioids, such as ZALVISO. The Medicine Company’s IONSYS is a non-invasive transdermal opioid PCA that could potentially compete with ZALVISO; however, a worldwide recall of the product was announced due to a commercial refocusing of the company. 
 
Additional potential opioid competitors for ZALVISO include Cara Therapeutics, Inc., who is developing a kappa opioid agonist, CR845, as an IV agent for the management of post-operative moderate-to-severe pain. Also, Trevena, Inc., has submitted an NDA for IV oliceridine, an intravenous G protein biased ligand that targets the mu opioid receptor for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain with a clinical development focus in acute post-operative pain. Both of these product candidates are invasive and, therefore, we do not believe they are direct competition to the non-invasive ZALVISO. 
 
Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Supply 
 
We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce sufentanil sublingual tablets for commercial product and for our clinical trials under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, with oversight by our internal managers. Equipment specific to the pharmaceutical manufacturing process was purchased and customized for us and is currently owned by us. We plan to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates if and when approved for marketing by the FDA. We currently rely on a single manufacturer for the preclinical and clinical supplies of our drug product for each of our product candidates and do not currently have agreements in place for redundant supply or a second source for any of our product candidates. We have identified other manufacturers that could satisfy our commercial supply and packaging requirements and we continue to evaluate those manufacturers.
 
In January 2013, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement, or the Services Agreement, with Patheon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Patheon, relating to the manufacture of sufentanil sublingual tablets for use with the ZALVISO device. Under the terms of the Services Agreement, Patheon has agreed to manufacture, supply, and provide certain validation and stability services with respect to ZALVISO for sale in the United States, Canada, Mexico and other countries, subject to agreement by the parties to any additional fees for such other countries. On August 22, 2017, we amended the Services Agreement with Patheon effective as of August 4, 2017, or the Amended Services Agreement, to include the manufacture of sufentanil sublingual tablets for use with DSUVIA. Under the terms of the MSA, Patheon will manufacture, supply, and provide certain validation and stability services for DSUVIA intended for marketing and sale in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and their respective territories, the European Union, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Australia. The term of the Amended Services Agreement has been extended until December 31, 2019, and automatically renews thereafter for periods of two years, unless terminated by either party upon eighteen months’ prior written notice. In addition, we entered into a related Amended and Restated Capital Expenditure and Equipment Agreement, or the Amended Capital Agreement, related to clinical and commercial production of our product candidates. Under the terms of the Amended Capital Agreement, we have made, and may make certain future modifications to Patheon’s Cincinnati facility. 
 
Device Manufacturing and Supply 
 
The device components of ZALVISO are manufactured by contract manufacturers, component fabricators and secondary service providers. Suppliers of components, subassemblies and other materials are located in Korea, Japan, Germany, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Canada and the United States. All contract manufacturers and component suppliers have been selected for their specific competencies in the manufacturing processes and materials that make up ZALVISO. FDA regulations require that materials be produced under cGMPs or Quality System Regulation, or QSR. We outsource injection molding of all the plastic parts for the cartridge and device and product sub-assemblies; tablet cartridge filling and packaging; and assembly, packaging and labeling of the dispenser and controller.

DSUVIA utilizes an SDA in the delivery of the tablets. FDA regulations require that materials be produced under cGMPs or QSR, as required for the respective unit operation within the manufacturing process. We outsource injection molding of all the plastic parts for the SDA, and product sub-assemblies; and filling, packaging and labeling of SDAs. 
Government Regulation 
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may legally be marketed in the United States.
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its’ implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and complying with applicable laws and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply at any time during the product development and approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

• | completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal trials and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the clinical safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug product;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product and the drug substance(s) are produced to assess compliance with cGMP;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of application, annual program fees; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

• | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Involves trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted conditions and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 
 19



Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP and QSR for medical device requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
Our product candidates, DSUVIA, and ZALVISO, are regulated under IND applications for clinical development and all device related information is filed under the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Section, or CMC, of an IND. 
 
The results of product development, preclinical trials and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on our drug products, proposed labeling and other relevant information, will be submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug product, requesting approval to market the product in the United States. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. During its review of an NDA, FDA may inspect our manufacturers for GMP and QSR compliance, and our pivotal clinical trial sites for GCP compliance.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
 
The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA issues a Complete Response Letter at the conclusion of its review if the NDA is not yet deemed ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. 

If one or more of our product candidates receive regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific conditions and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Our product candidates, if approved, will also require Risk Evaluations and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, which can include a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan, elements to assure safe use and implementation system, and must include a timetable for assessment of the REMS. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug product’s safety and effectiveness after the NDA. 
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 
Any drug products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated clinical safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Phase 4 clinical trials are conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post marketing requirements or commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of NDA approval. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drug products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers of drug products must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 
Drug product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drug products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. In the case of ZALVISO, the device component must comply with FDA’s Quality Systems Regulation. 
 
 20



We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct.
 
The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
 
Foreign Regulation 
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States.
 
In December 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, confirmed that an MAA for DZUVEO may be submitted in the EU under the EMA’s centralized procedure. This regulatory procedure, reserved for novel products, biotechnology products and new chemical entities, allows for commercialization across 31 EU and EFTA countries based on approval by EMA. We have submitted the DZUVEO MAA and anticipate a CHMP opinion in the first half of 2018.
 
We are responsible for maintaining ZALVISO device regulatory approval in the EU in order to support the manufacturing and supply of ZALVISO to Grünenthal for commercial sales. We completed the Conformité Européenne approval process for the ZALVISO device, more commonly known as a CE Mark approval. We received CE Mark approval in December 2014, which permits the commercial sale of the ZALVISO device in the European Union. In connection with the CE Mark approval, we were also granted International Standards Organization, or ISO, 13485:2003 certification of our quality management system. This is an internationally recognized quality standard for medical devices. Certification of our quality management system was issued by the British Standards Institution, or BSI, a Notified Body. ISO 13485:2003 certification recognizes that consistent quality policies and procedures are in place for the development, design and manufacturing of medical devices. The certification indicates that we have successfully implemented a quality system that conforms to ISO 13485 standards for medical devices. Certification to this standard is one of the key regulatory requirements for a CE Mark in the EU and EEA, as well as to meet equivalent requirements in other international markets. The certification applies to the Redwood City, California location which designs, manufactures and distributes finished medical devices, and includes critical suppliers. We have since undergone successful surveillance audits by the Notified Body for the ZALVISO CE mark and for our status as an ISO 13485 certified device manufacturer.
 
Controlled Substances Regulations 
 
Sufentanil, a Schedule II controlled substance, is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in DSUVIA and ZALVISO. Controlled substances are governed by the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, of the U.S. Department of Justice. Similarly, sufentanil is regulated as a controlled substance in Europe and other territories outside of the U.S. The handling of controlled substances and/or drug product by us, our contract manufacturers, analytical laboratories, packagers and distributors, are regulated by the Controlled Substances Act and regulations thereunder. 
The Drug Supply Chain Security Act of 2013, or DSCSA, imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements are that manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. Further, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 
 
Unforeseen delays to the drug substance and drug product manufacture and supply chain may occur due to delays, errors or other unforeseen problems with the permitting and quota process. Also, any one of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, laboratories, packagers and/or distributors could be the subject of DEA violations and enforcement could lead to delays or even loss of DEA license by the contractors.

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws and Regulations 
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws restrict certain business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency statutes and regulations.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare program. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and/or formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices involving remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce purchasing, leasing or ordering may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. The failure to satisfy all of the requirements of an applicable exception or safe harbor do not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under an exception or safe harbor.
 
Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act or PPACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Rather, if “one purpose” of the remuneration is to induce referrals, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is violated. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below). 
 
The federal civil False Claims Act and related laws prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Further, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to, among others, a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for a medical or other item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates that are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. International laws, such as the EU Data Privacy Directive (95/46/EC) and Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, regulate the processing of personal data within the European Union and between countries in the European Union and countries outside of the European Union, including the United States. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with safe harbor mechanisms could jeopardize business transactions across borders and result in significant penalties.
 
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies, for which federal healthcare program payment is available, report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 
 22



Also, many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. FDA and some states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies. In addition, certain states such as California require pharmaceutical companies to implement a comprehensive compliance program that includes a limit on expenditures for, or payments to, individual medical or health professionals. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products will be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 
In both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of any approved products will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Sales of our products will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third-party payers. These third-party payers are increasingly focused on containing healthcare costs by challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare product candidates. Third-party payers and hospitals may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. Because each third-party payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming, costly and sometimes unpredictable process. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payer and hospital separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. We cannot be certain that our products and our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. Because coverage and reimbursement determinations are made on a payer-by-payer basis, obtaining acceptable coverage and reimbursement from one payer does not guarantee that we will obtain similar acceptable coverage or reimbursement from another payer. If we are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate reimbursement and payment levels for, our product candidates from third-party payers, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition and future success. Third-party payers, government healthcare programs, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and hospitals frequently require that pharmaceutical companies negotiate agreements that provide discounts or rebates from list prices. We expect increasing pressure to offer larger discounts or discounts to a greater number of these organizations to maintain acceptable reimbursement levels for and access to our products. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by these mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs, private payers, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, hospitals, and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. In addition, if our competitors reduce the prices of their products, or otherwise demonstrate that they are better or more cost effective than our products, this may result in a greater level of reimbursement for their products relative to our products, which would reduce sales of our products and harm our results of operations.
 
There have been, and there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to commercialize our products profitably. We anticipate that the federal and state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt and implement healthcare policies, such as the Affordable Care Act, intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures may include: controls on government-funded reimbursement for drugs; new or increased requirements to pay prescription drug rebates to government health care programs; controls on healthcare providers; challenges to or limits on the pricing of drugs, including pricing controls, or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means; requirements to try less expensive products or generics before a more expensive branded product; and public funding for cost effectiveness research, which may be used by government and private third-party payers to make coverage and payment decisions.

 23



In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, there may be importation of foreign products that compete with our own products, which could negatively impact our profitability.
 
Healthcare Reform 
 
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations as we begin to commercialize our products. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state level that seek to reduce healthcare costs. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain from non-governmental payers. Moreover, private payers often follow federal healthcare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
 
Furthermore, political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental change. Initiatives to reduce the federal deficit and to reform healthcare delivery are increasing cost-containment efforts. We anticipate that Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, price controls on pharmaceuticals and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. Among other cost containment measures, the Affordable Care Act established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents. 
 
Legislative changes to the Affordable Care Act remain possible and appear likely in the 115th U.S. Congress and under the Trump Administration. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Currently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal, or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain fees mandated by the Affordable Care Act, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. Congress may still consider other legislation to repeal and replace elements of the Affordable Care Act. We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended or repealed in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we or our collaborators are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or our collaborators are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our product candidates may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.
 
 24



Further, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge for our products, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products. If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts. Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, price controls or patient access constraints under the Medicaid program, and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the impact of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payer or policy actions, which may include cost containment and other healthcare reform measures. Such policy actions could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. 
 
Reimbursement and Health Reform
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate that receives regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payers provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for product candidates. 
 
In the United States, third-party payers include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump Administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains additional drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 
Further, third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. 
 
Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payeor will pay for the drug product. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment. 
 
In the United States, the PPACA was enacted in an effort to, among other things, broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Aspects of PPACA that may impact our business include: 
 

• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PPACA has the potential to substantially change health care financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. 
 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2027 unless Congressional action is taken. The American Tax Payer Relief Act further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals.
 
Moreover, the DSCSA imposes additional obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. AcelRx is engaging CMOs and solution providers in serialization to implement the requirements of the DSCSA on our products. The acceptability of the approach that AcelRx is implementing will be ultimately subject to review by the FDA.
 
Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and further restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be.
 
Research and Development 
 
Conducting research and development is central to our business model. We have invested and expect to continue to invest significant time and capital in our research and development operations. Our research and development expenses were $19.4 million, $21.4 million and $22.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We plan to incur significant expenditures for the foreseeable future to address the recommendations made in the CRL for DSUVIA and prepare for the NDA resubmission, a likely FDA Advisory Committee meeting, and the required pediatric studies after approval. In addition, we continue to incur additional research and development expenses as we prepare the resubmission of the NDA for ZALVISO in the second half of 2018, as well as provide support for the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP’s, scientific review of the MAA for DZUVEO. 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 41 full-time employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
