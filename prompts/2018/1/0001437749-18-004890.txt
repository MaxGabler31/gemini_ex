When we refer in this report to “BioLargo,” the “company,” “our company,” “we,” “us” and “our,” we mean BioLargo, Inc., and our subsidiaries, including BioLargo Life Technologies, Inc., to hold our intellectual property; Odor-No-More, Inc., to manufacture, market, sell and distribute our odor and volatile organic compound control products; BioLargo Water USA, Inc. and its Canadian subsidiary BioLargo Water, Inc., to develop and market our AOS water treatment technologies; BioLargo Engineering, Science & Technologies, LLC, a professional engineering services division; BioLargo Maritime Solutions, Inc., to organize and evaluate business opportunities in and around the maritime industry for our technologies; and BioLargo Development Corp., which employs and provides benefits to our employees. We also own approximately 46% of Clyra Medical Technologies, Inc., an entity we formed to commercialize our technologies in the medical and dental fields.
 
The information contained in this Annual Report is as of December 31, 2017, unless expressly stated otherwise. 
 
Our Business- A Sustainable Technology Incubator
 
We are an innovation company driven by our mission is to “make life better” by developing breakthrough platform technologies, nurturing and building businesses around the intellectual property, while providing capital and support along the journey from “cradle” to “maturity”. Our business strategy is straightforward: we invent or acquire technologies that we believe have the potential to be disruptive in large commercial markets; we incubate these technologies to advance and promote their commercial success as we leverage our considerable scientific, engineering, and entrepreneurial talent; we then monetize these technical assets through a variety of business structures that may include licensure, joint venture, sale, spin off, or by deploying direct to market strategies. We seek to unlock the value of the underlying technologies to both advance our purposeful mission while we create value for our stockholders. 
 
Our first significant commercial success is unfolding now for our CupriDyne Clean odor and volatile organic compound “VOC” control products, sold through our subsidiary, Odor No More, Inc. Sales are increasing as we focus on serving the solid waste handling and wastewater treatment industries. We are gearing up for rapid growth as the product is experiencing market adoption. 
 
Our second commercial operation provides professional engineering services, through our subsidiary BioLargo Engineering, Science & Technologies, LLC (“BLEST”). Through BLEST, we provide a menu of professional engineering services to compliment and nurture our technologies as well as serve clients on a fee-for-service basis. 
 
In addition to our two operating subsidiaries, we have technologies and products in the development pipeline progressing towards commercialization, including our “Advanced Oxidation System,” that we target to have commercially ready in late 2018 or early 2019, and our medical products, which will be ready for commercialization as soon as we pass FDA clearance. 
 
Odor-No-More and CupriDyne Clean 
 
Our CupriDyne Clean industrial products reduce and eliminate tough odors and VOC’s in various industrial settings, delivered through misting systems, sprayers, water trucks and similar water delivery systems. We also offer powders that can be mixed to create liquids on site for our customers. We believe the product is the number one performing odor-control product in the market. It is priced 25% to 50% below competing products.
 
 - 2 -


We sell CupriDyne Clean for use in landfills, solid waste transfer stations, waste processing and recycling operations, waste-water treatment facilities, waste to energy conversion operations, materials recovery facilities, food processing operations, and livestock production facilities. Customers and experts from these markets report that effective odor control is a top priority in their daily operations and their commitment to serve their local communities where they operate. 
 
In mid-2017, we signed “national purchasing agreements” with three of the largest waste management companies in the United States. These agreements provide us “official” vendor status and authorize us to sell product to the customers’ local operations. Two-thirds of our CupriDyne Clean revenues in 2017 were generated from these agreements (see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”). These customers are expanding the use of CupriDyne Clean, and requested our engineering division submit bids to design and build delivery systems for CupriDyne Clean, such as misting systems for transfer stations. We have begun the process of submitting bids, and as of the date of this Report, have not yet been awarded any contracts. We believe this is a significant opportunity to serve our customers with a high value service that is complimentary to our product offerings.
 
We believe our sales of CupriDyne Clean are expanding because our product works better than competing products by eliminating, rather than masking, odors. Our clients have expressed dissatisfaction with existing products, and have told us that as a result of using our product, neighbor complaints have decreased significantly. While we can’t guarantee that every operator will receive such amazing results, our clients are extremely happy, one commenting,
 
“Finally, a product that actually works.”
 
We estimate there are almost 2,000 active landfills1, almost 8,000 transfer stations2, and almost 16,000 public wastewater treatment facilities3 in the United States. We are very focused on selling to these three markets, and to our “national purchasing agreement” clients. We recently hired two additional sales staff, and intend to hire more staff throughout 2018. Our team has become highly skilled at understanding how to serve these customers as they seek to serve the communities in which they operate with best of class operations. While the future success of these efforts cannot be assured, we are extremely confident and highly encouraged to focus and invest time, energy, staff and capital in these areas as resources permit. Our odor control division has the very real potential to carry our entire company operations to cash flow positive status and beyond.

Engineering Division
 
In September 2017, we formed BioLargo Engineering, Science & Technologies, LLC (“BLEST”) for the purpose of offering engineering services to third parties, and to provide engineering support services to our internal teams to accelerate the commercialization of our technologies. Its website is found at www.BioLargoEngineering.com. 
 
In the first few months since starting in late 2017, the team has secured 11 initial small clients for engineering services and have been highly active supporting our internal work around the scale-up and engineering associated with our AOS technology, as well as our industrial odor and VOC control product, CupriDyne Clean. They have multiple client project opportunities and proposals for external services that are material and well within the skill set of our team. We believe our early investment of working capital into BLEST has allowed us to secure their services to benefit our technologies at a highly cost-effective rate and at the same time developed a full menu of services to serve clients and grow our business. 
 
At inception, the subsidiary entered into a three-year office lease in the Knoxville Tennessee area, and entered into employment agreements with six scientists and engineers and one on an as needed consulting basis, with a combined 200+ years’ experience in diverse engineering fields. The team is led by Randall Moore, who served as Manager of Operations for Consulting and Engineering for the Knoxville office of CB&I Environmental & Infrastructure. The other team members are also former employees of CB&I and had longstanding careers at Shaw Engineering prior to CB&I. The team is highly experienced across multiple industries and they are considered experts in their respective fields, including chemical engineering, wastewater treatment (including design, operations, data gathering and data evaluation), process safety, energy efficiency, air pollution, design and control, technology evaluation, technology integration, air quality management & testing, engineering management, permitting, industrial hygiene, applied research and development, air testing, environmental permitting, HAZOP review, chemical processing, thermal design, computational fluid dynamics, mechanical engineering, mechanical design, NEPDES permitting, RCRA/TSCA compliance and permitting, project management, storm water design & permitting, marine engineering, AutoCAD, bench chemistry, continuous emission monitoring system operator, data handling and evaluation and decommissioning and decontamination of radiological and chemical contaminated facilities. 
 
We motivated our new team members by offering a profit sharing plan through which they can earn, over five years, a collective 30% profit interest in the subsidiary, and up to an aggregate 2,000,000 shares of BioLargo, Inc. common stock through option agreements. The profit interest and option shares are subject to a five year vesting schedule tied to the performance of the subsidiary, including gross revenue targets that increase over time, obtaining positive cash flow by March 31, 2018, collecting 90% of its accounts receivable, obtaining a profit of 10% in its first year (and increasing in subsequent years), making progress in the scale-up and commercialization of our AOS system, and using BioLargo research scientists (such as our Canadian team) for billable work on client projects. The details of these transactions were reported on a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 8, 2017. 
 
Our engineering team plans to focus its efforts in two areas. First, servicing third party clients in similar roles as to what they did at CB&I and Shaw Engineering and throughout their well-established careers. Their first client is a CB&I spin off that provides engineering services worldwide, and they have already started providing services to local utilities. They are evaluating, bidding on, negotiating, and generally pursing other commercial opportunities immediately. 
 
Second, our engineering team is working to assist BioLargo to scale-up, engineer and commercialize our AOS water treatment technologies, as well as support other technology and product development efforts within the BioLargo family of companies, including its industrial odor control solutions. By way of example, the team has submitted multiple proposals to existing Odor-No-More clients to engineer and design comprehensive misting systems. They have also begun designing a portable spray system for use on bulldozers at the request of a client landfill operator. BLEST will also pursue new inventions and be available to provide assistance where needed for any commercial opportunities that are presented by and through any and all operating units of BioLargo.

Advanced Oxidation System - AOS 
 
The Advanced Oxidation System (AOS) is a water treatment device in development that generates a series of highly oxidative species of iodine and other molecules that, because of the proprietary configuration and inner constituents of the AOS, eliminate pathogenic organisms with extreme efficacy, including: 

● | Salmonella enterica
--+--------------------


● | Listeria monocytogenes
--+-----------------------


● | Escherichia coli (E coli)
--+--------------------------


● | Pseudomonas aeruginosa
--+-----------------------


● | Fecal coliforms
--+----------------


● | Enterococci
--+------------


● | Bacteriophage T4 (Virus surrogate)
--+-----------------------------------


● | Bacteriophage MS2 (Virus surrogate)
--+------------------------------------

 
The AOS has also been shown capable to oxidize and break-down, or otherwise eliminate, or remove, soluble organic contaminants and oil and gas by-products like naphthenic acids and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and there is preliminary evidence that it can eliminate pharmaceutical by-products (micropollutants) commonly found in a wide variety of contaminated water sources. There is also promising preliminary data that suggest the AOS may be effective against the protozoan parasites Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium muris.
 
The key value proposition of the AOS is its ability to eliminate a wide variety of contaminants with high performance while consuming extremely low levels of input electricity – a trait made possible by the complex set of highly oxidative iodine compounds generated within the AOS reactor. Our proof-of-concept and case studies have generated results that suggest the AOS will be more cost- and energy-efficient than commonly used advanced water treatment technologies such as UV, electro-chlorination, and ozonation. This value proposition sets the AOS technology above other water treatment options, as we believe the AOS may allow safe and reliable water treatment for significantly lower cost compared to its competitors and may even enable advanced water treatment in applications where it otherwise would have been prohibitively costly.
 
Our AOS was the result of break-throughs in both advanced iodine electrochemistry and advances in materials engineering, and its invention led to BioLargo’s co-founding a multi-year research chair whose goal was to solve the contaminated water issues associated with the Canadian Oil Sands at the University of Alberta Department of Engineering in conjunction with the top five oil companies in Canada, the regional water district, and various environmental agencies of the Canadian government. Based on recovering oil prices and our ongoing work in Canada, we recently reinitiated discussions with a number of stakeholders in the oil sands industry to begin commercial piloting for our AOS to help treat and remediate oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) found in tailings ponds in the Canadian oil sands, an application that currently has no good technical solution. We have recently applied for significant grant funding to re-initiate our work to help treat OSPW, and we will be notified about the status of our funding application in the coming months.

Our work is continually progressing to support a number of commercial applications, with a key focus on wastewater treatment, food processing, agriculture, and oil and gas. We are also at the early stages of evaluating opportunities in in the storm drain recapture/recycling, and drinking water. Our AOS is an award-winning invention that is supported by science and engineering financial support and grants from various federal and provincial funding agencies in Canada such as NSERC, NRC-IRAP, and Alberta Innovates. 
 
In 2017, the Metropolitan Water District “MWD” of Southern California, through their Innovative Conservation Program, awarded a grant to our research team to study the AOS. MWD recently published an official report of the successful findings on their ICP web site (link here). Highlights of this report include: 

● | To be at least 50% more energy-efficient in comparison to incumbent technologies (U.V. and Ozone); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Be forecasted to involve far less maintenance cost than chlorination; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Could present an effective and cost-efficient alternative to market-available tertiary treatment technologies, and stands to afford major water and costs savings to the Californian municipal wastewater market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These results complement the AOS’s prior proof-of-claim results that prove the AOS can: 
 

● | Completely remove polyaromatic hydrocarbons;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | Inactivate 6 logs of bacterial pathogens (Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Inactivate 4 logs of virus surrogate; and
--+------------------------------------------


● | Remove naphthenic acids (up to 80% in single pass)
--+---------------------------------------------------

 
Financial support is expanding concurrently with ongoing work to commercially develop the latest AOS designs. We believe the AOS has an important and substantial commercial opportunity for licensure into in many segments of the water treatment industry, and we believe it should find early market adoption in helping manage industrial wastewater, namely in the livestock industry. 
 
Following extensive validation testing and refinement of the basic operating system, we began a commercial prototype development project that includes important third-party commercial validation studies and the design of its computer automation system. These next steps lead us to a product ready for commercial markets. This phase began in August 2016, when we introduced our first “Alpha” prototype at our annual technical symposium. The “Alpha” project was executed in collaboration with technical personnel at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (“NAIT”)'s Center for Sensors and Systems Integration and with NAIT's Applied Bio/Nanotechnology Industrial Research Chair. Bolstered by financial support provided by the Alberta Innovates nanoPDP program, this project focused on the development of a first-generation prototype system that incorporates a sensor platform to monitor various water parameters through online real-time data acquisition. The Alpha AOS system enables further scale up and testing in industrial settings, and work has commenced to develop a “Beta” unit for first stage commercial trials. Our AOS Beta unit is being developed as a flexible modular system to allow for a wide variety of sizes, configurations and functional uses to be deployed to meet a wide variety of unique and special requirements of customers across a wide range of industries.
 
Recent AOS Milestones
 
In February 2017, Mark Lambert joined our team as a “strategic advisor” to help develop and refine our commercialization plan for the AOS. Mr. Lambert has over 25 years of experience as a senior level executive with extensive experience in the water, renewable energy and environmental services industries.

In July 2017, we hired Shan Yong, PhD as our director of business development. Dr. Yong has more than 14 years of experience in international business development and technology consulting in the water and environmental sector. She has assisted us to review our strategic focus and narrow our work to commercially viable targets like micropollutants, disinfection, removal of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. These have application in the oils and gas industry, poultry wastewater and municipal wastewater, for example. 
 
In August of 2017 we held our 3rd annual technical symposium. We presented to a host of academics, government representatives and collaborators the summary of test data validating the performance and energy-efficiency of the AOS. We shared results from three commercial bench-scale pilot studies to validate performance of the AOS with industry-provided water for poultry process water, municipal wastewater and dairy wastewater. Two of these studies were supervised and audited by a commercial engineering firm. The outcome of the studies confirmed high levels of efficacy for disinfection, destruction and removal of soluble organics in a potential client’s actual waste stream.
 
In late 2017 we acquired a team of engineers and formed our own engineering services company, BioLargo Engineering Science and Technologies, LLC, (“BLEST”) (see above for more details) to provide internal and external engineering services. BLEST is actively preparing a process engineering package for the AOS system.  Major components of the package will include: design basis, process flow diagrams, piping and instrumentation diagrams, process control strategy document and materials of construction specifications. This work is underway. 
 
In early 2018 we have engaged in a series of important commercially focused activities around the AOS, including discussions with a series of industrial collaborators to do commercial piloting in 2018. We have also reengaged stakeholders in the Oil Sands industry for commercial piloting. We have begun negotiations with potential strategic partners from industry to perform commercial pilots with the intent use our AOS as a polishing step (replacing UV, electro-chlorination, or ozone) within their existing treatment trains (complete water treatment solutions). Importantly, we have designed and begun assembling our own proprietary water treatment train. We have also submitted and are currently submitting applications for a series of substantial government grants (totaling more than $4M USD) to focus on specific targets in industry, like wastewater, food processing and oil and gas applications. We are narrowly focused on validating efficacy for a few specific client challenges to offer a commercial solution, with a heavy focus on commercial piloting and demonstration. 
 
The University of Alberta
 
The research and development of our AOS system has primarily been accomplished at our research facility at the University of Alberta campus in Edmonton, Canada. We are able to utilize the extensive resources of the University and its researchers on a contract for hire basis as needed. We work closely with the Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Science at the University of Alberta and its Department of Engineering, and partner with University professors on government and industry sponsored financial awards and grants to support our ongoing research and development as we refine the AOS in preparation of commercial pilots and commercial designs. We have received over 55 grants thus far. Generally, the financial awards take on two common themes: first, science and engineering grants in which the University of Alberta is the primary recipient and contracting party with the grant agency to support work on and around our technology; and second, direct grants in which our Canadian subsidiary is the contracting party to support ongoing science and engineering to advance our AOS towards commercialization, sometimes supporting the work of PhD students at the University. In both cases, the financial awards support much, but not all, of the research budget and related costs. Our research arrangement with the University has three high value propositions for BioLargo: (i) a depth of resources and talent to accomplish highly skilled work, (ii) financial aid to support research and development costs and (iii) independent and credible validation of our technical claims. The total value of the grants awarded exceeds $1,500,000.

In part because of these grants, we have multiple ongoing collaborations with university researchers, all with the goal of validating and/or improving our AOS technology, and to expand the scope of its treatment ability to increase its potential market. These collaborations include:
 
Dr. Kerry McPhedran: Dr. McPhedran is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Geological Engineering at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, SK. His research collaboration with BioLargo Water aims to identify, quantify, and characterize the oxidative iodine-containing molecules produced in our AOS in order to better understand the chemistry that results in our powerful water disinfection and decontamination results. A better understanding of the iodine compounds produced in our AOS is important for us to fine-tune the performance to cost ratio generated by our technology. Dr. McPhedran’s research involves the use of Hard X-ray Microanalysis (HXMA) equipment at the world-renowned Canadian Light Source (CLS) in Saskatoon. This research is funded by an NSERC Engage grant.
 
Dr. Douglas Ivey: Dr. Ivey is a Professor in the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering at the University of Alberta, and his research collaboration with BioLargo Water focuses on characterizing the materials that make up the AOS reactor at a microstructural level. This involves the use of cutting-edge electron microscopy equipment and techniques, and has so far provided important information about aspects of the AOS such as the useful lifetime of its inner constituents, and the effects of dissolved solids and organics on the materials that make up the AOS. This research is funded by an NSERC Engage grant as well as a grant from the Council Alliance for a Sustainable Built Environment (CASBE).
 
Dr. Edward Roberts: Dr. Roberts is a Professor in the Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering at the University of Calgary in Calgary, AB. His seminal work with the AOS was the first that independently validated the generation of iodine-containing oxidative compounds within the AOS, a key aspect of our technology’s value proposition. His collaboration was funded by an NSERC Engage and Engage plus.
 
Advanced Wound Care – Clyra Medical Technologies Subsidiary
 
We formed Clyra Medical Technologies, Inc. (“Clyra”) to commercialize our technology in the medical products industry, which we believe can be disruptive to many existing product lines. Our initial product focus is in the “advanced wound care” field, which includes traumatic injury, diabetic ulcers, and chronic hard-to-heal wounds. 
 
Our advanced wound care products combine broad-spectrum antimicrobial capabilities with iodine’s natural and well-understood metabolic pathway to promote healing. Our products are highly differentiated from existing antimicrobials in multiple ways - by the gentle nature in which they can perform, reduced product costs, extended antimicrobial activity, and biofilm efficacy. In addition, iodine has no known acquired microbial resistance, unlike many competing products. 
 
We believe the markets for these products will include infection control and wound therapy for chronic wounds. We also intend to pursue and study the use of our technology as a compliment to regenerative tissue therapy.

In 2017, Clyra completed product development on its first design with its advanced wound care technology, and retained Emergo, a global leader in the medical device regulatory field, to prepare and submit to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) premarket notification of a medical device under Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The 510(k) notification was submitted to the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”). The submission has been referred by the CDRH to the FDA Office of Combination Products (“OCP”), which has jurisdiction to classify a product as a drug, device, biological product, or combination product. We have asked the OCP for a determination whether our product should be regulated as a medical device, drug, or combination product. While we remain confident that we will ultimately receive premarket clearance for our products, we can make no assurance or prediction as to when we will receive a response from the OCP, whether OCP will agree that our first product should be regulated as a medical device, or, if OCP determines that our products are devices, the ultimate success of Clyra’s efforts to obtain premarket notification of this submission, and must wait patiently for the process with the FDA to conclude. 
 
Clrya intends this to be the first of multiple FDA submissions for “advanced wound care” and other products, including products within the orthopedic field, specifically in the area of hip and knee replacement to minimize microbial contamination / infection post closure. It is currently preparing a second submission for premarket notification under Section 510(k).
 
While FDA applications are pending, Clyra’s management is actively engaged in arranging for clinical work in both the wound care and orthopedic field utilizing key opinion leaders, and is also in discussions with a number of potential strategic partners for commercialization and further development of the technology. Clyra presented the results of testing conducted for its FDA application at the SAWC international conference held in October 2017 (http://www.sawc.net/fall/). The semi-annual SAWC meeting is the premier interdisciplinary wound care program and the largest annual gathering of wound care clinicians in the United States. 
 
In 2017, we filed a third patent application related to our technology for use in medical products. Two applications were filed in 2016. While these patent applications are pending, we intend to continue expanding patent coverage as we refine our medical products.
 
In addition to the Advanced Wound Care and orthopedic fields, we believe our technology has the potential for disruption in other key medical related fields, including dental and veterinary medicine.
 
Clyra Medical - Capitalization
 
We currently own 46.3% of Clyra’s outstanding common and preferred stock. Two of the members of our board of directors sit on the three-member Clyra board. Our ownership of Clyra has been diluted through investments in December 2015, and August 2017. In December 2015, Clyra sold 9,830 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock (“Preferred Shares”) to Sanatio Capital, LLC (“Sanatio”) for $750,000. Sanatio is beneficially owned by Jack B. Strommen, who was later elected to BioLargo’s board of directors. This sale was made in reliance on the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder as not involving a public offering of securities. 
Clyra’s Preferred Shares accrue an annual dividend of 8% for a period of five years. Although the dividends begin to accrue immediately, Clyra has no obligation to declare a dividend until a product of Clyra has received a premarket approval by the United States Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”), or for which a premarket notification pursuant to form 510(k) has been submitted and for which the FDA has given written clearance to market the product in the United States (either, “FDA Approval”). After FDA Approval, annually on December 20, and unless prohibited by California law governing distributions to shareholders, Clyra is required to declare and pay any accruing dividends to holders of Preferred Shares then accrued but unpaid.
 
Holders of Preferred Shares are entitled to preferential payments in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Clyra, in an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends. After such preference, any remaining assets are distributed pro-rata between holders of Clyra common stock and Preferred Shares as if the Preferred Shares had converted to common stock. Holders of Preferred Shares may convert the shares to common stock initially on a one-to-one basis. The conversion formula is subject to change in the event Clyra sells stock at a lower price than the price paid by Sanatio.

In addition to the $750,000 investment, once Clyra receives FDA Approval for a product, Sanatio has agreed to provide Clyra a $5,000,000 credit facility for operating, warehouse, inventory and costs necessary to rapidly expand sales (“Line of Credit”). Terms of the Line of Credit are to be negotiated in good faith, be commercially reasonable and mutually agreeable to the parties. Should Sanatio fail to provide the Line of Credit, BioLargo has the right to do so under similar terms and conditions offered to Sanatio, and neither Clyra nor any of its shareholders, affiliates, successors or assigns will have any recourse or remedies against Sanatio for failing to provide the Line of Credit. If either BioLargo or an entity not affiliated with Sanatio provides the Line of Credit (either directly, through an affiliate, or third party), Clyra shall issue such lender a warrant to purchase an amount of Clyra common stock equal to 10% of Clyra’s capital stock on a fully-diluted basis, at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of Clyra’s common stock on the date of issuance, as determined by its board of directors in good faith.
 
BioLargo, Sanatio and other Clyra shareholders entered into an agreement whereby the parties agreed to elect a three-member board of directors, consisting of Clyra’s president, BioLargo’s president, and a Sanatio representative, who shall initially be Mr. Strommen. The shareholders also agreed to restrict the sale of any stock in Clyra unless all holders of Preferred Shares are allowed to participate in such transaction and the consideration received pursuant to such transaction is allocated among the parties thereto in the manner specified in its articles of incorporation in effect immediately prior to the sale.
 
Clyra licenses our technology through a license agreement dated December 17, 2012, and amended December 30, 2015 (“License Agreement”). The License Agreement grants Clyra the exclusive world-wide right to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import products for use within the field of human wound care (as defined in the License Agreement), expandable to include other medical products. 
 
In addition to the foregoing, Clyra entered into a consulting agreement with Beach House Consulting, LLC, through which Jack B. Strommen will be providing consulting services to Clyra. Mr. Strommen is a founder and leader of PD Instore (www.pdinstore.com), works with some of the world’s leading retailers, and has overseen many national ground-breaking marketing rollouts and initiatives. Mr. Strommen will be assisting Clyra in its sales and marketing activities once it has FDA Approval on a product, at which point the agreement provides that Mr. Strommen is to receive $23,437.50 per month for a period of four years.
 
On March 31, 2017, Sanatio and Clyra agreed to a line of credit through which Clyra drew $250,000, accruing interest at a rate of 10%, and including a 5% original issue discount. On July 22, 2017, Sanatio Capital LLC and Clyra agreed to convert the line of credit to common shares at a price per share equal to that offered to investors in a new securities offering. As of the date of conversion, the outstanding amount due on the line of credit was $270,400. Once the offering price was established, Sanatio was issued 1,690 shares of Clyra common stock at $160 per share.
 
On August 4, 2017, Clyra commenced a private securities offering of its common shares at a price of $160 per share, and accepted $1,000,000 in subscriptions. It issued 6,250 shares of its common stock to two investors. Of that amount, BioLargo invested $250,000 and was issued 1,562.5 shares.
 
Subsequent to the issuance of shares to investors in the August 2017 offering, and to Sanatio for conversion of its line of credit, BioLargo owns 15,297.5 shares of Clyra common stock. These shares comprise 46.3% of the voting stock at Clyra. Two members of BioLargo’s board of directors (Dennis P. Calvert and Jack B. Strommen) are two of the three members of Clyra’s board of directors.

Additional Product Lines
 
Technology License - Isan System
 
On August 18, 2014, we entered into a manufacturing and distribution license agreement for our Isan® system with Clarion Water, a new operating division of InsulTech Manufacturing, LLC (www.insultech.com), the latter of which has over 20 years of commercial success around the globe representing hundreds of millions in sales of technical products to Fortune 100 companies.
 
Co-owned with Peter Holdings, Ltd. through a joint venture agreement, the Isan system leverages the power of iodine to provide the world’s most effective disinfection dosing systems. It has been referred to as one of the most important technical advancements in food safety in the past 20 years. It won a “top 50 water company award” by the Artemis Project in 2010 and a DuPont Innovation Award for its excellence in science and innovation in 2004.
 
The Isan System is a reliable and efficient automated iodine dosing system. It is the winner of a Top 50 Water Technology Award by the Artemis Project and a Dupont Innovation Award. Its combines precise dosing with a straight-forward “set-it-and-forget-it” automated computer-controlled system that features controlled measuring, flow rate, dosing and iodine extraction/removal technology, as well as an automatic tracking system that precisely delivers iodine in calibrated doses into a water stream or container of water. The Isan system has been proven to substantially reduce the incidence of fungal growth, spoilage, microorganisms and pathogens in water and on food. The system is capable of functioning at the high flow rates commensurate with industrial disinfection needs. 
 
Per the terms of our license agreement, Clarion is obligated to pay royalties on revenue equal to 10%. As we jointly own the Isan System with Peter Holdings, Ltd., all royalties are to be shared equally with Peter Holdings, Ltd. The intellectual property subject to the license agreement includes all intellectual property related to the Isan System, including all patents, trademarks, proprietary knowledge, and other similar know-how or rights relating to or arising out of the Isan System or the patents related to the Isan System. The agreement contains other terms and conditions typically found in intellectual property license agreements.
 
Since licensing the technology, Clarion completed a comprehensive technical and engineering update to the Isan System, featuring a new automated touch screen user interface, enhanced security, enhanced control features for increased monitoring and sensing, and adding automated functionality providing users unmatched flexibility, reliability and control over this state-of-the-art disinfectant delivery system, and begun commercial trials. In 2016, it received approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use of Isan generated iodine, “IoMax,” as it is delivered in poultry drinking water. In 2017, Clarion received approval for expanded uses of its IoMax iodine, including for sanitizing livestock drinking water, livestock barns and vehicles, milking and dairy related equipment, food grade egg shells, retort cooling water, HVAC units, and general farm premises. We do not believe Clarion intends to pursue any of those markets. Rather, Clarion has begun a process to expand regulatory coverage for additional uses in agriculture and for food safety. We believe Clarion is evaluating various high value applications that require additional regulatory approvals, proof of claims and investment. We have yet to receive royalties from Clarion pursuant to our license agreement. We continue to work with Clarion to evaluate various choices about how to move forward and to expand opportunities for the Isan and IoMax products.

Downeast Logistics
 
In late 2013, we entered into a cooperative selling and distribution agreement with Downeast Logistics, a certified “Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business” (SDVOSB), as our distribution partner to facilitate our first order to the United States government. Downeast has been instrumental in developing ongoing sales to the government and military. We have six products with National Stocking Numbers. 
 
We offer two primary products through these channels. The first is our Specimen Transport Solidifer. We sell the product to the Defense Logistics Agency, which then delivers it to military installations all over the world. This product is used to transport hazardous materials such as blood and urine samples, which may need to be sent from a military base to a laboratory or hospital. It is designed to absorb liquids on contact and release our proprietary iodine technology. Our second primary product sold to the government and military is our Suction Canister Solidifer. It is sold to hospitals and to the Defense Logistics Agency, and is used during surgery to solidify and reduce odors of body fluids.

In March 2016, two of our product lines (consisting of 9 SKUs) of Nature’s Best Science products were awarded a five-year U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) supply contract, under schedule 65IIA for medical equipment and supplies.  The award opens up access to these products through “GSA Advantage”, the online shopping and ordering system that provides government agencies access to thousands of contractors and millions of supplies (products) and services. We intend to apply for inclusion of additional existing and future products into GSA Advantage, including our industrial odor control product, CupriDyne Clean. In December 2016, these same product lines as well as our CupriDyne Clean Industrial Odor Eliminator were accepted to the DOD eMALL which is another purchasing portal for the Defense Department and other State and Federal agencies. As of the date of this report, our products are approved for sale and available to all branches of government at the federal, state and local levels through five different purchasing portals.
 
Commercial, Household and Personal Care Products
 
CHAPP includes broad product categories and many opportunities for the application of our technologies. It is defined by the ability to utilize similar, if not identical, consumption products in multiple market segments. Detergents, single use absorbents, wipes, and products that provide odor, infection control or stain removal, all fall within this category. Packaging ranges from consumer sizes of a few ounces to bulk packaging for commercial or industrial use. We are currently offering products in this category under four brands – Odor-No-More, Nature’s Best Science, Deodorall and NBS. Our primary product offerings include an animal-bedding additive that controls odor and moisture. We also sell liquid odor control products to private label (aka “White Label”) customers who then in turn sell product to consumers and industrial clients, including a product that eliminates smoke odors.
 
We are continuing our efforts to generate additional “private label” clients, albeit on a passive basis, due to the increasing sales activities associated with CupriDyne Clean. We continue to meet with new potential customers from time to time, for private label opportunities. We also have relationships and remain in discussions with potential strategic partners to provide large scale manufacturing and distribution should we secure orders for the private label business opportunities or experience a rapid increase in any product whereby we need to supplement manufacturing to meet client delivery needs. Success in these markets is highly dependent upon the willingness of the potential partners to invest in product support to continue marketing and expanding customer awareness.
 
Our sales in the CHAPP product category are nominal. Product development, sales and marketing require significant financial resources that we currently have elected to invest elsewhere while, also, limiting our risk in these highly competitive and commodity markets. As such, our progress in this area has been slow and will likely continue to be slow until such time as we secure the appropriate commercial partners. As opportunities present themselves, we market our technology for licensure to established companies in this industry segment. We rely upon independent agents and key industry contacts for this activity, and it is not a top priority. We continue to expand our proof of claims and product designs for various odor and moisture control applications. We believe this segment will enjoy commercial success only as we continue to prove the market viability for our CupriDyne Clean product. Therefore, we are more narrowly focused on the business to business sales and marketing activity to help gain exposure and build credibility for our consumer product designs and technology. Because the core science is so effective, easy to use and safe, we are cautiously optimistic that this segment will also return to be a financially important opportunity for our company as we continue to expand sales and our market presence in the industrial odor control market.

BioLargo Maritime Solutions, Inc. 
 
We formed BioLargo Maritime Solutions, Inc. to organize and evaluate business opportunities in and around the maritime industry for our technologies, including our AOS, with an emphasis on the ballast water treatment mandate set forth by the International Maritime Organization and the US Coastguard that had mandated an adoption by industry of new discharge standards by late 2017. As a result of the protest from industry and the lack of clarity over how the mandate standards for discharge requirements would be measured and enforced, the enforcement of mandates was extended by as much as five years. While the trend and regulatory initiatives are continuing, the economics of current technical solutions and the business case has remained uncertain and fraught with what we believe to be high capital requirements and a less than optimal return on investment proposition. While we remain interested given the right economic climate, we are hesitant to fully pursue this market segment until we are more confident in our future success. To continue, we will need to organize a strategy and additional resources, including capital and proper staffing, to pursue business opportunities. This subsidiary is not yet operational and we have no immediate plans to pursue the related opportunities until such time as the regulatory mandates are enforced and/or until such time as we find the appropriate pull from industry to justify any investment on our part. 
Product Development Pipeline
 
Our CupriDyne technology is used to efficiently deliver iodine in various products. It can be delivered in any physical form and can be combined with other ingredients, such as fragrances in our odor control products, and surfactants in our stain removal and odor control products. Additional ingredients can often be added without sacrificing its practical and safe functions as well as its oxidation potential. Our product designs include liquids, sprays, gels, powders, coatings and absorbents. 
 
Safety and efficacy are key for CupriDyne. Each of our product designs delivers iodine safely and precisely to achieve effective odor control, stain-removal, or surface washing, and in some applications at high doses, broad-spectrum disinfection. CupriDyne’s primary ingredients, as well as reaction by-products, are “generally recognized as safe” (“G.R.A.S.”) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as food additives in their basic forms. CupriDyne’s commercial product opportunities are diverse, and we have an extensive menu of product designs in various stages of commercialization and licensure development, discussed in detail below in the “Commercial, Household and Personal Care Products” and “CupriDyne Clean – Industrial Odor Control” sections. 
 
We believe CupriDyne is unique. The iodine most of us are familiar with, sold in pharmacies and used by hospitals, has severe limitations – it is considered toxic, causes staining, and contains a limited dose of the active oxidizing ingredient. Our CupriDyne technology, on the other hand, directly addresses many of these shortcomings – it delivers iodine’s oxidizing ingredient (“free iodine”) with precision, ranging from very small doses up to very large doses with more than 30 times the performance of chlorine. We can deliver iodine that is both non-toxic and non-staining, thus extending its usefulness well beyond historical product applications. 
 
 - 13 -


Our CupriDyne technology is flexible, allowing product designs to incorporate varying dosing levels. Some product designs focus on odor, and do not act as disinfectants. Some product designs do act as disinfectants, and would require regulatory approval to make such claims. 
 
We are continually listening to customers and industry to innovate new products based on our patented technologies, including CupriDyne.
 
We believe that as our company continues to advance its commercial success, many of the product opportunities that can include our CupriDyne technology will gain more attention and should expand our business with licensing or white label opportunities. In the mean time, we have narrowed our focus to advance sales of our CupriDyne Clean products. 
 
Our Clya product development pipeline is equally robust in its diverse opportunities to be included in a long list of medical related products to deliver antimicrobial efficacy, odor control, support for healing, infection control across a broad range of delivery systems.
 

Intellectual Property
 
Patent - an Expanding Intellectual Property Estate
 
We have 17 patents issued, including 15 in the United States, and multiple pending. We believe these patents provide a foundation from which to continue building our patent portfolio, and we believe that our technology is sufficiently useful and novel that we have a reasonable basis upon which to rely on our patent protections. We also rely on trade secrets and technical know-how to establish and maintain additional protection of our intellectual property. As our capital resources permit, we expect to expand our patent protection as we continue to refine our inventions as well as make new discoveries. See the detailed discussion below of our patent portfolio.
 
We regard our intellectual property as critical to our ultimate success. Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products and technologies in geographic areas of commercial interest and to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information through laws and contractual arrangements.
 
Our Chief Science Officer, Mr. Kenneth R. Code, has been involved in the research and development of the technology since 1997. He has participated in the Canadian Federal Scientific Research and Experimental Development program, and he was instrumental in the discovery, preparation and filing of the first technology patents. He has worked with manufacturers, distributors and suppliers in a wide variety of industries to gain a full appreciation of the potential applications and the methodologies applicable to our technology for their manufacture and performance. He continues to research methods and applications to continue to expand the potential uses of our technology as well as work to uncover new discoveries that may provide additional commercial applications to help solve real world problems in the field of disinfection. 
In 2016 and 2017, we continued improving our technology and creating new uses of our technology through further research and development efforts. During that time, we filed three U.S. patent applications, each comprised of multiple individual claims, and were granted one patent by the USPTO, with a second granted in 2018. Our technology also includes know-how and trade secrets, which, together with our intellectual property, contribute to our expertise in product design, manufacturing, product claims, safety features and competitive positioning of products that feature our technology. 
 
 - 14 -


During 2018 we plan to continue to advance our proof of claims, inventions and patent filings.
 
We incurred approximately $1,600,000 in expense related to our research and development activities in 2017, an increase of approximately $250,000 over the prior year. Our research and development expenditures in 2018 could vary significantly and will depend upon our access to capital. 
 
We believe that our suite of intellectual property covers the presently targeted major areas of focus for our licensing strategy. The description of our intellectual property, at present, is as follows:

Pending Patent Applications
 
Most recently, we filed two patent applications in the United States for our advanced wound care formulas. The inventions in these applications form the basis for the work at Clyra Medical and the products for which that subsidiary intends to seek FDA approval. In addition to these applications, we have filed patent applications in multiple foreign countries, including the European Union, pursuant to the PCT, and other provisional applications. 
 
Subject to adequate financing, we intend to continue to expand and enhance our suite of intellectual property through ongoing focus on product development, new intellectual property development and patent applications, and further third-party testing and validations for specific areas of focus for commercial exploitation. We currently anticipate that additional patent applications will be filed during the next 12 months with the USPTO and the PCT, although we are uncertain of the cost of such patent filings, which will depend upon the number of such applications prepared and filed. The expense associated with seeking patent rights in multiple foreign countries is expensive and will require substantial ongoing capital resources. However, we cannot give any assurance that adequate capital will be available. Without adequate capital resources, we will be forced to abandon patent applications and irrevocably lose rights to our technologies.
