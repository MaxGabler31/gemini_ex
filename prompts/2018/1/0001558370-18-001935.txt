 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Our Business
 TTEC Holdings, Inc. (“TTEC”, “the Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a global customer experience company that designs, builds and operates omnichannel customer experiences on behalf of some of the world's most innovative brands. We help these large global companies increase revenue and reduce costs by delivering personalized customer experiences across every interaction channel and phase of the customer lifecycle as an end-to-end provider of customer engagement services, technologies, insights and innovations. Since our establishment in 1982, we have helped clients strengthen their customer relationships, brand recognition and loyalty by simplifying and personalizing interactions with their customers. We deliver thought leadership, through innovation in programs that differentiate our clients from their competition.    We are organized into two centers of excellence: TTEC Digital and TTEC Engage.
· | TTEC Digital provides digital consultancy for designing and building human centric, tech-enabled, insight-driven customer experience solutions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | TTEC Engage is the Company’s global hub of operational excellence providing clients with turnkey customer acquisition, care, revenue growth, and digital trust and safety services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  TTEC Digital and TTEC Engage come together under our unified offering, HumanifyTM Customer Engagement as a Service, which drives measurable results for clients through delivery of personalized omnichannel interactions that are seamless and relevant. Our offering is supported by 56,000 employees delivering services in 24 countries from 97 customer engagement centers on six continents. Our end-to-end approach differentiates the Company by combining service design, strategic consulting, data analytics, process optimization, system integration, operational excellence, and technology solutions and services. This unified offering is value-oriented, outcome-based, and delivered on a global scale across four business segments, two of which comprise TTEC Engage - Customer Management Services (“CMS”) and Customer Growth Services (“CGS”); and two of which comprise TTEC Digital - Customer Technology Services (“CTS”) and Customer Strategy Services (“CSS”).
 Our revenue for fiscal 2017 was $1,477 million, approximately 23% or $336 million of which came from the CGS, CTS and CSS segments, focused on customer-centric strategy, growth or technology-based services with the remainder of our revenue coming from the core customer care services of our CMS segment.
 To improve our competitive position in a rapidly changing market and stay strategically relevant to our clients, we continue to invest in innovation and growth businesses, diversifying and strengthening our core customer care services with consulting, data analytics and insights technologies, and technology-enabled, outcomes-focused services. 
 We also invest in businesses that enable us to expand our geographic footprint, broaden our product and service capabilities, increase our global client base and industry expertise, and further scale our end-to-end integrated solutions platform. In 2017, we acquired Motif, Inc., a digital trust and safety services company based in India and the Philippines, and Connextions, Inc., a U.S.-based health services company focused on improving the customer relationships for healthcare plan providers and pharmacy benefits managers.
 While we have customer relationship experience in almost every industry, we have developed tailored expertise in the automotive, communications, healthcare, financial services, government, logistics, media and entertainment, retail, technology, travel and transportation industries. We target customer-focused industry leaders in the Global 1000 and serve approximately 300 clients globally.
 Our strong balance sheet, cash flows from operations and access to debt and capital markets have historically provided us the financial flexibility to effectively fund our organic growth, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, incremental investments, and capital distributions.

 We continue to return capital to our shareholders via an ongoing stock repurchase program and semi-annual dividends. As of December 31, 2017, our cumulative authorized share repurchase allowance was $762.3 million, of which we have repurchased 46.1 million shares for $735.8 million. Our remaining repurchase allowance is $26.6 million which may be increased at the discretion of our Board of Directors. For the period from January 1, 2018 through February 28, 2018, we did not purchase any additional shares. Our stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date.
 Given our cash flow generation and balance sheet strength, we believe cash dividends and early returns to shareholders through share repurchases, in balance with our investments in innovation and strategic acquisitions, align shareholder interests with the needs of the Company. On February 24, 2015, our Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy, with the intent to distribute a periodic cash dividend to stockholders of our common stock, after consideration of, among other things, TTEC’s performance, cash flows from operations, capital needs and liquidity factors. The initial dividend of $0.18 per common share was paid on March 16, 2015 to shareholders of record as of March 6, 2015. Thereafter, the Company has been paying a semi-annual dividend in October and April of each year in amounts ranging between $0.18 and $0.25 per common share. Effective February 28, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an additional semi-annual dividend of $0.27 per common share, payable on April 12, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2018.
 Our Market Opportunity
 Our end-to-end customer experience approach is designed to drive retention, affinity, growth, and customer protection, all with savings for our clients. Our transition from multichannel to true omnichannel service requires agility and speed and TTEC’s integrated approach is growing in strategic relevance because of the following trends:
· | Increasing focus on customer engagement to sustain competitive advantage. — The ability to sustain a competitive advantage based on price or product differentiation has significantly narrowed given the speed of technological innovation. As our clients’ customers become more connected and widely broadcast their experiences across a variety of social networking channels, the quality of the experience has a profound impact on brand loyalty and business performance. We believe customers are increasingly shaping their attitudes, behaviors and willingness to recommend or stay with a brand on the totality of their experience, including not only the superiority of the product or service but more importantly on the quality of their ongoing service interactions. Given the strong correlation between high customer satisfaction and improved profitability, we believe more companies are increasingly focused on selecting third-party partners, such as TTEC, that can deliver integrated insights-driven strategy, service and technology solutions that increase the lifetime value of each customer relationship versus merely reducing costs.

· | Increasing percentage of companies consolidating their customer engagement requirements with a few select partners who can deliver measurable business outcomes by offering an integrated, technology-rich solution. — The proliferation of mobile communication technologies and devices along with customers’ increased access to information and heightened expectations are driving the need for companies to implement enabling technologies that ensure customers have the best experience across all devices and channels. These two-way interactions need to be received or delivered seamlessly via the customer channel of choice and include voice, email, chat, SMS text, intelligent self serve, virtual agents and the social network. We believe companies will continue to consolidate to third-party partners, like TTEC, who have demonstrated expertise in increasing brand value by delivering a holistic, integrated customer-centric solution that spans the customer experience from strategy through execution versus the time, expense and often failed returns resulting from linking together a series of point solutions from different providers.

· | Focus on speed-to-market by companies launching new products or entering new geographic locations. — As companies broaden their product offerings and enter new markets, they are looking for partners that can provide speed-to-market while reducing their capital and operating risk. To achieve these benefits, companies select us because of our extensive operating track record, established global footprint, financial strength, commitment to innovation, and our ability to quickly scale infrastructure and complex business processes around the globe in a short period of time while assuring a high-quality experience for their customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our Strategy
 We aim to grow our revenue and profitability by focusing on our core customer engagement operational capabilities linking them to higher margin, insights and technology-enabled platforms and managed services to drive a superior customer experience for our clients’ customers. To that end we plan to continue:
· | Building deeper, more strategic relationships with existing global clients to drive enduring, transformational change within their organizations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pursuing new clients who lead their respective industries and who are committed to customer engagement as a differentiator;

 Customer Strategy Services Segment

 Customer Technology Services Segment
 In connection with the design of the customer engagement strategy, our ability to architect, deploy and host or manage the client’s customer experience environments becomes a key enabler to achieving and sustaining the client’s customer engagement vision. Given the proliferation of mobile communication technologies and devices, we enable our clients’ operations to interact with their customers across the growing array of channels including email, social networks, mobile, web, SMS text, voice and chat. We design, implement and manage cloud, on-premise or hybrid customer experience environments to deliver a consistent and superior experience across all touch points on a global scale that we believe result in higher quality, lower costs and reduced risk for our clients. Through our Humanify™ Technology platforms, we also provide data-driven context aware software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) based solutions that link customers seamlessly and directly to appropriate resources, any time and across any channel.
 TTEC Engage houses our end-to-end managed services operations for customer care, growth and trust and safety services.
 Customer Management Services Segment
 We design and manage clients’ front-to-back office processes to deliver just-in-time, personalized, protected, multi-channel interactions. Our front-office solutions seamlessly integrate voice, chat, email, e-commerce and social media to optimize the customer experience for our clients. In addition, we manage certain client back-office processes to enhance their customer-centric view of relationships and maximize operating efficiencies. We also perform fraud prevention and content moderation services to protect our clients and their customers from malevolent digital activities. Our delivery of integrated business processes via our onshore, offshore or work-from-home associates reduces operating costs and allows customer needs to be met more quickly and efficiently, resulting in higher satisfaction, brand loyalty and a stronger competitive position for our clients. Customer Growth Services Segment
 We offer integrated sales and marketing solutions to help our clients boost revenue in new, fragmented or underpenetrated business-to-consumer or business-to-business markets. We deliver or manage approximately $4 billion in client revenue annually via the discovery, acquisition, growth and retention of customers through a combination of our highly trained, client-dedicated sales professionals and proprietary analytics platform. This platform continuously aggregates individual customer information across all channels into one holistic view so as to ensure more relevant and personalized communications.
 Based on our clients’ requirements, we provide our services on an integrated cross-business segment and on a discrete basis.
 Additional information with respect to our segments and geographic footprint is included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

  Technological Excellence
 Our Humanify Technology Platforms are based on secure, private, 100% internet protocol based infrastructure. This architecture enables us to centralize and standardize our worldwide delivery capabilities resulting in improved scalability and quality of delivery for our clients, as well as lower capital, and lower information technology (“IT”) operating costs.
 The foundation of this platform is our nine data centers located on five continents. Our data centers provide a fully integrated suite of voice and data routing, workforce management, quality monitoring, business analytic and storage capabilities, enabling seamless operations from any location around the globe. This hub and spoke model enables us to provide our services at competitive cost while increasing scalability, reliability, asset utilization and the diversity of our service offerings. It also provides an effective redundancy for timely responses to system interruptions and outages due to natural disasters and other conditions outside our control. We monitor and manage our data centers 24 x 7, 365 days per year from several strategically located global command centers to ensure the availability of our redundant, fail-over capabilities for each data center.
 Importantly, this platform has become the foundation for new, innovative offerings including TTEC’s cloud-based offerings, Humanify @Home for remote omnichannel agents, and our suite of human capital solutions.
 Further, our Humanify Technology Platforms leverage reference architectures for multiple scenarios whether we are operating the platforms and the services, implementing customized platforms for clients, or providing advanced managed services, continuous and automated development environments.
 Innovative Human Capital Strategies
 Our globally located, highly trained employees are a crucial component of the success of our business. We have made significant investments in proprietary technologies, management tools, methodologies and training processes in the areas of talent acquisition, learning services, knowledge management, workforce collaboration and performance optimization. These capabilities are the culmination of more than three decades of experience in managing large, global workforces combined with the latest technology, innovation and strategy in the field of human capital management. This capability has enabled us to deliver a consistent, scalable and flexible workforce that is highly engaged in achieving or exceeding our clients’ business objectives. Globally Deployed Best Operating Practices
 Globally deployed best operating practices assure that we deliver a consistent, scalable, high-quality experience to our clients’ customers from any of our 97 customer engagement centers and work from home associates around the world. Standardized processes include our approach to attracting, screening, hiring, training, scheduling, evaluating, coaching and maximizing associate performance to meet our clients’ needs. We provide real-time reporting and analytics on performance across the globe to ensure consistency of delivery. This information provides valuable insight into what is driving customer inquiries, enabling us to proactively recommend process changes to our clients to optimize their customers’ experience.
 Our global operating model includes customer engagement centers in 17 countries on six continents that operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. New customer engagement centers are established and existing centers are expanded or scaled down to accommodate anticipated business demands or specific client needs. We have significant capacity in the Philippines, India, Mexico and Brazil to support customer demand and deliver superior cost efficiencies. We continue to explore opportunities in North America, Central Europe and Africa to diversify our client footprint enabling near-shore and off-shore locations that enable our multi-lingual service offerings and provide superior client economics.

 See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a description of the risks associated with our foreign operations.
 Clients
 We develop long-term relationships with Global 1000 companies in customer intensive industries, whose business complexities and customer focus requires a partner that can quickly and globally scale integrated technology and data-enabled services.
 In 2017, our top five and ten clients represented 35% and 49% of total revenue, respectively; and one of our clients, Telstra Corporation Limited, represented 9.0% of our total annual revenue. In several of our operating segments, we enter into long-term relationships which provide us with a more predictable revenue stream. Although most of our contracts can be terminated for convenience by either party, our relationships with our top five clients have ranged from 10 to 21 years including multiple contract renewals for several of these clients. In 2017, we had a 95% client retention rate for the combined Customer Management Services and Customer Growth Services segments.
 Certain of our communications clients provide us with telecommunication services through arm’s length negotiated transactions. These clients currently represent approximately 13% of our total annual revenue. Expenditures under these supplier contracts represent less than one percent of our total operating costs.
 Competition
 We are a global customer experience company that designs, builds and operates omnichannel customer experiences on our clients’ behalf. Our competitors vary by geography and business segment, and range from large multinational corporations to smaller, narrowly-focused enterprises. Across our lines of business, the principal competitive factors include: client relationships, technology and process innovation, integrated solutions, operational performance and efficiencies, pricing, brand recognition and financial strength.
 Our strategy in maintaining market leadership is to prudently invest, innovate and provide integrated value-driven services, all centered around customer engagement management. Today, we are executing on a more expansive, holistic strategy by transforming our business into higher-value offerings through organic investments and strategic acquisitions. As we execute, we are differentiating ourselves in the marketplace and entering new markets that introduce us to an expanded competitive landscape.
 In our Customer Management Services business, we primarily compete with in-house customer management operations as well as other companies that provide customer care including: Alorica, Convergys, Sykes, and Teleperformance, among others. As we expand our offerings into customer engagement consulting, technology, and growth, we are competing with smaller specialized companies and divisions of multinational companies, including Bain & Company, McKinsey & Company, Accenture, IBM, AT&T, Interactive Intelligence, LiveOps, inContact, Five9, WPP, Publicis Groupe, Dentsu, Sitel, and others.
 Employees
 Our people are our most valuable asset. As of December 31, 2017, we had 56,000 employees in 24 countries on six continents. Although a percentage of our Customer Management Services segment employees are hired seasonally to address the fourth quarter and first quarter higher business volumes in retail, healthcare and other seasonal industries, most remain employed throughout the year and work at 97 locations and through our @home environment. Approximately 65% of our employees are located outside of the U.S. Approximately 10% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, most of which are mandated under national labor laws outside of the United States. These agreements are subject to periodic renegotiations and we anticipate that they will be renewed in the ordinary course of business without material impact to our business or in a manner materially different from other companies covered by such industry-wide agreements.

 Research, Innovation, Intellectual Property and Proprietary Technology
 We recognize the value of innovation in our business and are committed to developing leading-edge technologies and proprietary solutions. Research and innovation have been a major factor in our success and we believe that they will continue to contribute to our growth in the future. We use our investment in research and development to create, commercialize and deploy innovative business strategies and high-value technology solutions.
 We deliver value to our clients through, and our success in part depends on, certain proprietary technologies and methodologies. We leverage U.S. and foreign patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws as well as confidentiality, proprietary information non-disclosure agreements, and key staff non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary technology.
 As of December 31, 2017 we had 41 patent applications pending in 8 jurisdictions; and own 116 U.S. and non-U.S. patents that we leverage in our operations and as market place differentiation for our service offerings. Our trade name, logos and names of our proprietary solution offerings are protected by their historic use and by trademarks and service marks registered in 27 countries.
