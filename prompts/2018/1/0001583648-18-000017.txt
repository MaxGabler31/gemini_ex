Business Overview
We are a clinical stage biotechnology company that discovers and develops Anticalin-based drugs to target validated disease pathways in a unique and transformative way. Our clinical pipeline includes an immuno-oncology (IO) bispecific targeting HER2 and 4-1BB, an inhaled IL-4 receptor alpha antagonist Anticalin protein to treat uncontrolled asthma and a half-life-optimized, hepcidin antagonizing Anticalin protein to treat anemia. Our proprietary Anticalin proteins are a novel class of therapeutics validated in the clinic and by partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies.
Anticalin proteins are a class of low molecular-weight therapeutic proteins derived from lipocalins, which are naturally occurring proteins typically found in human blood plasma and other bodily fluids. Anticalin-branded proteins function similarly to monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, by binding tightly and specifically to a diverse range of targets. An antibody is a large protein used by the immune system that recognizes a unique part of a foreign target molecule, called an antigen. We believe Anticalin proteins possess numerous advantages over antibodies in certain applications. For example, Anticalin proteins are small in size and are monomeric, meaning they are comprised of a single protein units rather than a multi-protein complex. Therefore, we believe Anticalin proteins are generally more stable biophysically than tetrameric monoclonal antibodies, composed of four protein subunits, potentially enabling unique routes of drug administration such as pulmonary delivery. Higher-molecular-weight entities, such as antibodies, are often too large to be delivered effectively through these methods. Our Anticalin technology is modular, which allows us to design Anticalin proteins to bind with specificity to one or multiple targets at the same time. This multispecificity offers advantages in biological settings where binding to multiple targets can enhance the ability of a drug to achieve its desired effects, such as killing cancer cells. Moreover, unlike antibodies, the pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile of Anticalin proteins can be adjusted to potentially enable program-specific optimal drug exposure. Such differentiating characteristics suggest that Anticalin proteins have the potential, in certain cases, to become first-in-class drugs. 
We have access to intellectual property rights directed to various aspects of our Anticalin technology platform, allowing for development and advancement of our platform and drug candidates. We believe our ownership and/or license of our Anticalin platform provides us with a strong intellectual property position, particularly where we are seeking to address targets and diseases in a novel way and for which there is existing monoclonal antibody intellectual property.
Our core Anticalin technology and platform were developed in Germany, and we have collaboration arrangements with major multi-national pharmaceutical companies headquartered in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. We also established a collaboration with Les Laboratoires Servier and Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier, or Servier, in January 2017 and entered into an exclusive license agreement with Aska Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Aska, in February 2017. In May 2017, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement, and a Non-Exclusive Anticalin Platform Technology License Agreement with AstraZeneca AB, or AstraZeneca. In February 2018 we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Seattle Genetics Inc. ("Seattle Genetics"). We have also in-licensed different antibodies to drive the advancement of our multispecific immuno-oncology pipeline. These include existing agreements with Sanofi Group, or Sanofi, and F.Hoffmann—La Roche Ltd. and Hoffmann—La Roche Inc., or Roche.

In connection with our efforts to develop multispecific Anticalin-based proteins designed to engage immunomodulatory targets, during the second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a License and Transfer Agreement with Sichuan Kelun-Biotech Biopharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (“Kelun”). Under that Agreement, Kelun has granted to us a non-exclusive worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) under certain intellectual property owned or controlled by Kelun to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize bi- and multi- specific fusion proteins that include a monoclonal antibody developed by Kelun specific for an undisclosed target and one or more Anticalin proteins. We believe that the drug-like properties of the Anticalin drug class were demonstrated in various clinical trials with different Anticalin-based drug candidates, including PRS-080, PRS-060 and others.
Our current development plans focus on two core pillars, immuno-oncology, or IO, and respiratory diseases. In addition, we are developing PRS-080, a non-core asset, for the treatment of functional iron deficiency anemia. 
The first bispecific Anticalin-based drug candidate in our IO pipeline, PRS-343, was designed to target the immune receptor 4-1BB and the tumor target HER2. PRS-343 is the result of a genetic fusion of a variant of the HER2-targeting antibody trastuzumab with an Anticalin protein specific for 4-1BB. The mode of action of this 4-1BB/ HER2 bispecific is to promote 4-1BB clustering by bridging 4-1BB-positive T cells with HER2-positive tumor cells, and to thereby provide a potent costimulatory signal to tumor antigen-specific T cells. PRS-343 is intended to localize 4-1BB activation in the tumor, and to thereby both increase efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity compared to 4-1BB-targeting antibodies being developed by third parties in clinical trials. Patient dosing in a multicenter, open-label, Phase I dose escalation study that will include expansion cohorts, commenced in September 2017. The study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability, and potential anti-cancer activity of PRS-343 in patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-positive solid tumors for which standard treatment options are not available, are no longer effective, are not tolerated, or the patient has refused standard therapy. Elevated HER2 expression is associated with multiple cancers, including gastroesophageal, bladder, breast, and a range of other tumor types. 
In January 2017 Pieris initiated a strategic collaboration with Servier to discover and develop five Anticalin-based bispecific therapeutics in immuno-oncology. Three programs are currently undergoing preclinical evaluation together with Servier.
Pieris continues to explore opportunities to develop additional differentiated Anticalin-based multispecific therapeutics in IO. To this end, discovery campaigns are ongoing to generate functionally active Anticalin proteins against immunomodulatory targets. We are carrying out proof of concept and proof of mechanism studies will be carried out on several additional fully proprietary programs to support drug candidate nomination.
The second Anticalin drug candidate, PRS-060, binds to the IL-4 receptor alpha-chain (IL-4Ra), thereby inhibiting the actions of IL-4 and IL-13, two cytokines (small proteins mediating signaling between cells within the human body) known to be key mediators in the inflammatory cascade that causes asthma and other inflammatory diseases. The small size and biophysical stability of PRS-060 could enable direct delivery to the lungs, through the use of an inhaler, which we believe may enable high pulmonary concentrations of the drug candidate to be achieved at lower doses than would be reached with antibodies that are systemically delivered. Further, an inhaled drug may be expected to be substantially better tolerated than systemically administered antibodies. We initiated a single ascending dose study of PRS-060 in December 2017. 
PRS-060 is being developed in partnership with AstraZeneca under our strategic alliance initiated in May 2017. Pieris is sponsoring the Phase I clinical study for PRS-060, after which AstraZeneca will be responsible for further clinical development. Pieris has the right to opt-into further co-development and co-commercialization of PRS-060 with AstraZeneca after completion of the Phase IIa clinical study. 
The third Anticalin drug candidate, PRS-080, is a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated Anticalin protein that binds to hepcidin, a natural regulator of iron levels in the blood. An excess amount of hepcidin can cause functional iron deficiency, or FID, which often cannot be treated adequately with iron supplements and can lead to anemia. PRS-080 has been designed to target hepcidin for the treatment of FID in anemic patients with chronic kidney disease, or CKD, particularly in end-stage renal disease patients requiring dialysis. We believe that by blocking the actions of hepcidin, PRS-080 may serve to address anemia by mobilizing iron from the endogenous iron stores in the body for incorporation into red blood cells. With a serum half-life of several days, PRS-080 was designed to inhibit hepcidin sufficiently to mobilize functional serum iron for erythropoiesis, followed by recovery of blood hepcidin levels to prevent iron overload.
PRS-080 has been investigated in two single-ascending dose Phase I/Ib trials, first in healthy subjects, then in stage 5 CKD patients requiring hemodialysis, both under governance by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, or BfArM). Single intravenous PRS-080 administrations were safe and well tolerated up to the tested dose of 16 mg/kg in healthy volunteers and up to the tested dose of 8 mg/kg in end-stage CKD patients. The studies were completed in 2015 and 2017, respectively. Both trials demonstrated dose proportional elevations in both serum iron and transferrin saturation. Based on the Phase I results, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
6

controlled, multiple ascending dose (two cohorts of 4mg/kg and 8 mg/kg, respectively) pilot Phase IIa study in anemic hemodialysis dependent CKD patients commenced in the third quarter of 2017. This study is intended primarily to obtain initial results on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacological activity of 5 once weekly doses of PRS-080, and secondarily to evaluate the effect of repeated PRS-080 administration on hemoglobin levels in this patient population. Completion of dosing of all patients is expected in mid-2018.
Strategy
Our goal is to become a fully integrated biotechnology company by discovering and developing Anticalin-based therapeutics to target validated disease pathways in a unique and transformative way, and later developing and commercializing our products. We intend to engage with partners for many of our programs in a combination of geographic and indication-based arrangements to maximize our business opportunities. We also intend to retain certain development and commercial rights on selected products as our experience in drug development grows. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Advancing PRS-343 through Phase I dose escalation first-in-patient trial followed by expansion studies and combination regimens in selected HER2 positive tumor patient populations with major unmet needs.

A multicenter Phase I study with PRS-343 commenced in September 2017. The study will aim to assess safety and tolerability of PRS-343. 

• | Advancing PRS-060 through first-in-human trial. Our first-in-human clinical trial for PRS-060 commenced in December 2017 and we intend to start a follow up study that demonstrates Proof of Mechanism for PRS-060 in the second half of 2018.


• | Advancing PRS-332 to development candidate nomination and initiate IND-enabling activities. PRS-332 is currently undergoing preclinical evaluation together with Servier.


• | Advancing PRS-080 through a multi-ascending dose study

In the fourth quarter of 2017 we initiated a Phase IIa study of PRS-080 in anemic hemodialysis dependent CKD patients. This study is intended primarily to obtain initial results on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacological activity of 5 once weekly doses of PRS-080, and secondarily to evaluate the effect of repeated PRS-080 administration on hemoglobin levels in this patient population. Completion of dosing of all patients is expected in the second half of 2018.

• | Continuing to build our platform by entering into new partnerships and license and collaborative arrangements and advancing our currently partnered programs. We have entered into partnership and collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies in a diverse range of therapeutic areas and geographies. We have active partnerships with global pharmaceutical companies, such as Servier, AstraZeneca, Seattle Genetics, Sanofi, Roche, and Aska. Together with our partners, we intend to advance multiple drug candidates through preclinical studies and to select further drug candidates for clinical development in the future. We will also continue to seek to engage with new pharmaceutical partners that can contribute funding, experience and marketing ability for the successful development and commercialization of our current and future drug candidates.


• | Pursuing additional opportunities for our Anticalin technology. We intend to continue to identify, vet and pursue opportunities to develop novel Anticalin therapeutics for oncology, respiratory diseases, and additional diseases, as we continue to improve on the Anticalin platform technology.

Anticalin platform technology
Our platform technology focuses on low molecular-weight Anticalin proteins that bind tightly and specifically to a diverse range of targets. Anticalin proteins are derived from human proteins called lipocalins, which are naturally occurring low-molecular weight human proteins of approximately 18 to 20kDA molecular mass typically found in blood plasma and other bodily fluids. The lipocalin class of proteins defines a group of extracellular specific-binding proteins that, collectively, exhibit extremely high structural homology, yet have an uncharacteristically low amino acid sequence identity (less than 20%), making them attractive “templates” for amino acid diversification. Lipocalins naturally bind to, store and transport a wide spectrum of molecules. The defining attributes of the 12-member human lipocalin class and, by extension, Anticalin proteins, engineered from the lipocalin class of proteins, are a four-loop variable region and a rigidly conserved beta-barrel backbone, which, together, form a cup-like binding pocket. The graphic below shows both tear (left) and NGAL (right) lipocalins.
7


We currently develop our Anticalin proteins from either tear lipocalin, found primarily in human tear fluid as well as the lung epithelium, or neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a protein involved in the innate immune system, by making discreet mutations in the genetic code for the binding regions. These mutations have the potential to lead to highly specific, high-affinity binding for both small and large molecular targets. Random mutations are introduced at pre-defined positions involved in endogenous ligand engagement, creating exponentially diverse pools of Anticalin proteins, the most potent and well behaved of which are selected and optimized in a customized manner through in vitro selection. Using techniques such as phage display, a successful technique in antibody-based drug discovery, to build and refine antibody libraries, the ability to introduce diversity and then select for the best binders among a large pool of Anticalin proteins gives us the opportunity to select Anticalin proteins for a wide variety of targets. The flexibility inherent in the Anticalin proteins’ cup-like structure allows us to choose both small-molecule targets that fit inside the ‘cup’ as well as larger protein targets that can be bound by the Anticalin proteins’ outward-facing arms. Our Phase Ia trial for PRS-080, our prior Phase I study of PRS-050 as well as Daiichi's Phase I study of a PCSK9-specific Anticalin protein indicates that these proteins may be non-immunogenic and thereby have the potential to exhibit a favorable safety profile.
The below graphic demonstrates Anticalin drug candidates binding to a small molecule (left), a small protein target (hepcidin, center) and a large protein target (CTLA4, right):

To obtain a specific Anticalin protein, we take advantage of the breadth of our proprietary Anticalin libraries, generated through our protein engineering expertise. We have created, and will continue to create, proprietary Anticalin libraries by rationally diversifying the lipocalin regions that are responsible for ligand binding, applying different libraries to different types of targets. By utilizing bacterial production from the earliest stages of drug discovery through Current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, manufacturing, we have created a seamless platform that improves the quality, yield and cost-effectiveness of our drug candidates. However, Anticalin protein manufacturing is not limited to bacterial systems, with the underlying expression system being driven on a program-by-program basis. See “—Manufacturing” below.
As targeted, protein-based molecules, Anticalin proteins also function similarly to monoclonal antibodies, thereby offering many of the same favorable qualities, including:


• | High specificity to their targets. Like monoclonal antibodies, Anticalin proteins can bind their targets without binding other molecules, even molecules with very similar chemical structures or amino acid sequences, allowing for more effective treatments through, for example, minimizing off-target effects.


• | Tight binding and effective biological activity at their targets. Like monoclonal antibodies, Anticalin proteins are able to bind their targets at subnanomolar affinities. Anticalin proteins can potentially achieve desirable biological effects by inhibiting an undesired or inducing a desired cell activity by binding to cell-surface receptors or their ligands.


• | Human origin. Like many monoclonal antibodies in development and marketed today, Anticalin proteins are derived from a natural class of circulating human proteins. Their human origin increases the likelihood that Anticalin proteins will not be recognized as foreign by the immune system and subsequently rejected.


• | Scalability for large-scale production. Like monoclonal antibodies, Anticalin proteins lend themselves to large-scale production, yet can also be produced in a range of expression systems ranging from prokaryotic (bacterial) to eukaryotic (animal, plant, fungal) cells. Anticalin proteins can take advantage of several well-understood and widely

8

practiced methods of protein production both in small amounts for preclinical testing and at larger scale for clinical trials and commercial production.
While often compared to monoclonal antibodies, Anticalin proteins, we believe, offer several advantages over antibodies, including:


• | Small size and biophysical stability. Anticalin proteins are small in size and are monomeric. Therefore, we believe Anticalin proteins are generally more stable biophysically than tetrameric monoclonal antibodies, which will potentially enable unique routes of administration to target diseases, such as pulmonary delivery. Higher-molecular-weight entities such as antibodies are often too large to be delivered effectively through these methods. We believe Anticalin proteins will also be less expensive to manufacture than antibodies due to their lower molecular weight and less bulky structure as well as the ability to use the prokaryotic-based manufacturing systems, a less costly manufacturing system than mammalian cell-based manufacturing systems, to create them.


• | Optimization of half-life. Anticalin proteins can be engineered to have a half-life that is optimal for the indication area and a desired dosing schedule. Antibodies typically have half-lives of two weeks or longer, whereas Anticalin proteins can be engineered to have half-lives from hours to weeks, depending on the half-life extension technology employed, if any. This optionality allows us to exert greater control over the amount of circulating Anticalin protein in the blood and the amount of time such Anticalin proteins circulate in the blood, depending on the underlying biology we are trying to address.


• | Modular platform for higher-order multispecificity and avoidance of cross-linking. Our Anticalin technology is modular, allowing for monovalent or multivalent target engagement, including multispecificity within a single protein. We believe that a monovalent “backbone” is an advantage in situations where pure antagonism of certain cellular receptors is desired. The dual-binding nature of monoclonal antibodies, which have two “arms,” can be a disadvantage in cases when the antibodies bind to and cross-link cell-surface receptors. Such cross-linking often leads to undesirable activation of the cells bearing those receptors. Single-action (monovalent) Anticalin proteins have only a single binding site and are thus not subject to cross-linking. Further, when it is called for by the biology we are addressing, we can create multispecific Anticalin proteins that can simultaneously bind (i) two or more different targets or (ii) different epitopes, the specific piece of an antigen to which an antibody binds, on the same target by genetically linking Anticalin proteins with distinct specificities on a common cDNA strand. We believe this multispecificity offers advantages in biological settings where binding to multiple targets can enhance the ability of a drug to achieve its desired effects, such as killing cancer cells. Unique Anticalin proteins can be pieced together and undergo simultaneous target engagement as a single fusion protein, without generally compromising on manufacturability.


• | Flexible formatting facilitates selection of potent T cell engagers. The molecular architecture of Anticalin proteins as a single polypeptide chain that folds into a stable eight-stranded β-barrel with exposed N- and C-termini, both not part of the binding site, makes them ideal building blocks to generate bispecific and even multispecific fusion proteins offering novel therapeutic modalities. Multispecific Anticalin-based fusion proteins can be used to pursue innovative therapeutic strategies in IO, particularly by addressing the “immunological synapse” that forms at the interface upon contact between an immune cell and a cancer cell. This can drive an efficient activation of tumor-specific T cells in the vicinity of the tumor, thereby avoiding some of the toxicities observed with peripheral T cell activation in healthy tissues. Generally, the formatting flexibility of Anticalin-based biologics offers the ability of modulating valency and geometry of the multispecific compound according to biological needs. For example, Anticalin proteins can be genetically fused to either the N- or C-terminus of the antibody heavy or light chain, thereby resulting in different geometries of the fusion protein with the antibody as well as Anticalin binding sites covering a range of distances with regard to the T cell target on the one hand and the tumor antigen on the other. 

Implementation of our Anticalin Platform Technology: Our Drug Candidates Pipeline
Each of our drug candidates is in the early stage of development, and we anticipate that it will likely be several years before any of our drug candidates could be commercialized. The following table summarizes the status of our current drug candidates and programs:

PRS-343 targeting 4-1BB (CD-137) in oncology
PRS-343 is a bispecific protein targeting the immune receptor 4-1BB and the tumor target HER2. It is generated by genetic fusion of an Anticalin protein specific for 4-1BB to each heavy chain of a variant of the HER2-targeting antibody trastuzumab. The mode of action of this 4-1BB/HER2 bispecific is to promote 4-1BB clustering by bridging 4-1BB-positive T cells with HER2-positive tumor cells, and to thereby provide a potent costimulatory signal to tumor antigen-specific T cells. PRS-343 is intended to localize 4-1BB activation in the tumor, and to thereby both increase efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity compared to 4-1BB-targeting antibodies being developed by third parties in clinical trials. We initiated a Phase I dose-escalation study of PRS-343 in HER2 positive patients in September 2017. 
Biology of the costimulatory immune receptor 4-1BB
4-1BB, is a co-stimulatory immune receptor and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor, or TNFR, super-family. It is mainly expressed on activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, activated B cells, and natural killer, or NK, cells. 4-1BB plays an important role in the regulation of immune responses and thus is a target for cancer immunotherapy. 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) is the only known natural ligand of 4-1BB, and is constitutively expressed on several types of antigen-presenting cells, or APC. 4-1BB-positive T cells are activated by engaging a 4-1BBL-positive cell. The induced 4-1BB clustering leads to activation of the receptor and downstream signaling. Note that the trimeric 4-1BBL as a soluble molecule is not an effective 4-1BB agonist, providing evidence that larger scale clustering is required for activation. In a T cell pre-stimulated by the T cell receptor binding to a cognate Major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, target, costimulation via 4-1BB leads to further enhanced activation, survival and proliferation, as well as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an improved capacity to kill.
Validation of 4-1BB as a therapeutic target in cancer
The benefit of 4-1BB costimulation for the elimination of cancerous tumors has been demonstrated in a number of in vivo models in the mouse. The forced expression of 4-1BBL on a tumor, for example, leads to tumor rejection. Likewise, the forced expression of an anti-4-1BB single chain antibody fragment (scFv) on a tumor leads to a CD4+ T cell and NK-cell dependent elimination of the tumor. A systemically administered anti-4-1BB antibody has also been demonstrated to lead to retardation of tumor growth.
Human ex vivo data support the extraordinary potential of 4-1BB as a costimulatory receptor in cancer therapy: It has been reported that for T cells isolated from human tumors, 4-1BB is an effective marker for those that are tumor-reactive. Based on this observation, we believe anti-4-1BB antibodies can be utilized to improve adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) by augmenting the expansion and activity of CD8+ melanoma tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.
Finally, the potential of 4-1BB targeting has also been shown in nonclinical combination therapy studies, where an additional benefit was demonstrated by combination of 4-1BB agonism with checkpoint blockade or NK cell-targeting antibodies.
10

Current approaches to clinical 4-1BB targeting
The preclinical demonstration of the potential therapeutic benefit of 4-1BB costimulation has spurred the development of therapeutic antibodies targeting 4-1BB, PF-05082566 (22, 23) and BMS-663513, which are currently in early phase clinical trials.
PF-05082566 is a fully humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds 4-1BB in a manner that blocks the binding of endogenous 4-1BBL to 4-1BB, and that according to publicly available data is well tolerated as a monotherapy and in combination with rituximab.
BMS-663513 is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that, in contrast to PF-05082566, binds 4-1BB in a manner that does not interfere with the 4-1BB / 4-1BBL interaction. While an initial trial reported manageable toxicity with doses up to 10mg/kg, a follow-up monotherapy Phase II trial was reported to have been stopped due to an “unusually high incidence of grade 4 hepatitis”. Current clinical trials with BMS-663513 are focusing on safety and efficacy at lower doses as monotherapy or in combination e.g. with Rituximab (NCT01775631).
Rationale for bispecific targeting of 4-1BB
We believe that the natural mode of activation of 4-1BB, which requires receptor clustering, demonstrates that an ideal 4-1BB-targeting agent should firstly lead to clustering of 4-1BB, and secondly do so in a tumor-localized fashion on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or TILs. The antibodies currently in clinical development are not ideal in that respect, as 4-1BB clustering can only be induced by binding to Fcg receptor-positive cells, which are not selectively tumor-localized but distributed throughout the body for Fcg-dependence of TNFR targeting. The toxicity data of BMS-663513 indicates that such a non-selective activation leads to unacceptable toxicity, potentially making it impossible to find a therapeutic window for such 4-1BB-targeting antibodies.
We therefore hypothesized that to obtain an ideal 4-1BB-targeting agent, a bispecific molecule should be designed that targets 4-1BB on one end and a differentially expressed tumor target on the other end. A visualization of the general concept is provided in Figure 1, below. HER2/4-1BB bispecific is envisioned to promote 4-1BB clustering by bridging T cells with HER2-positive tumor cells, and to thereby provide a potent costimulatory signal to tumor antigen-specific T cells, further enhancing its T cell receptor, or TCR, -mediated activity and leading to tumor destruction.



Figure 1 | Concept of costimulatory T cell engagement. (A) The elements of the system are a target-positive tumor cell, a T cell with a TCR that is specific for an HLA/peptide combination on the tumor, and a costimulatory bispecific. (B) Within a patient´s tumor, tumor-specific T cells are bridged with tumor cells by a costimulatory bispecific. The resulting clustering of the costimulatory T cell receptor provides a local co-activating signal to the T cell, further enhancing its TCR-mediated activity and leading to tumor destruction. (C) Toxic side effects are expected to be manageable, as target-negative cells do not lead to costimulation of T cells due to a lack of target-mediated receptor clustering, and healthy tissue is spared by tumor-costimulated T cells due to the absence of a primary, TCR-mediated signal. Design and Generation of HER2/4-1BB bispecific PRS-343

11

To obtain a molecule that would work by the mode of action of costimulatory T cell engagement, we generated the HER2/4-1BB bispecific PRS-343. The molecule consists of two different building blocks binding to the two targets HER2 and 4-1BB. To generate the 4-1BB-specific building block of PRS-343, we utilized Anticalin technology. A 4-1BB-binding Anticalin protein was generated based on a re-design of the natural binding pocket of NGAL using mutant Anticalin libraries and a selection and screening process. The lead 4-1BB-binding Anticalin Protein binds human 4-1BB with an affinity of 2 nM as determined by SPR, and is capable of costimulating human T cells when immobilized on a plastic dish together with an anti-CD3 antibody.
To generate the bivalent HER2/4-1BB bispecific PRS-343, we constructed a genetic fusion of a 4-1BB-specific Anticalin protein to the C-terminus of each heavy chain of the trastuzumab IgG4 variant, connected by a flexible, non-immunogenic 15 amino acid linker sequence.
We utilized a Sandwich ELISA experiment to investigate whether PRS-343 can bind both targets at the same time, which is a necessary prerequisite for the envisioned mode of action of PRS-343. Figure below shows that a sigmoid binding curve results from this titration, proving that both targets can indeed be engaged at the same time, fulfilling the key requirement for simultaneous costimulatory engagement of T cells by HER2-positive target cells.



Figure 2 | PRS-343 simultaneous binding to targets HER2 and 4-1BB. Recombinant Her2 was coated on a microtiter plate, followed by titration of PRS-343. Subsequently, a constant concentration of biotinylated human 4-1BB was added, which was detected via a peroxidase-conjugated avidin variant, ExtrAvidin®.

Mode of action – costimulatory T cell activation
We developed a novel T cell activation assay format to investigate whether PRS-343 is capable of costimulating T cells that have received a basic stimulus via the TCR. The assay, visualized in Figure 3 below, is based upon providing the T cell receptor stimulus via an anti-CD3 antibody coated onto the plastic culture dish, while 4-1BB costimulation is achieved by tumor-target dependent clustering of 4-1BB on purified T cells.

Figure 3 | Visualization of costimulatory T cell activation assay. HER2-positive tumor cells are grown overnight on cell culture plates that have been precoated with low amounts of an anti-CD3 antibody to provide a limited primary activation of T cells via the T cell receptor. T cells are added to the wells together with the titrated 4-1BB/HER2 bispecific PRS-343, leading to clustering of the costimulatory 4-1BB receptor, which in turn results in T cell costimulation. T cell costimulation is detected by increased supernatant IL-2 and IFN-g levels in the culture supernatants after continued culture.

There is a clear induction of IL-2 (Figure A) and IFN-γ (Figure C) with increasing concentrations of PRS-343. The fitted EC50 of this effect is similar for both proinflammatory cytokines, with 0.7 nM for IL-2 induction and 0.3 nM for IFN-ã
 induction, respectively. That T cell costimulation is indeed, due to the bispecific engagement of T cells and SKBR3 cells, shown by two observations: firstly, the monospecific antibody trastuzumab does not lead to enhanced T cell activation (average shown as dotted line in Figure A and Figure C), and secondly, disrupting the bispecific interaction with an excess of trastuzumab abolishes the effect of IL-2 and INF-g induction almost completely, except at the highest concentrations of PRS-343 employed (Figure B and Figure D).



Figure 4 | Experimental result of costimulatory T cell activation assay. HER2-positive SKBR3 tumor cells were grown overnight on 96-well plates that had been precoated with 0.25 µg/mL anti-CD3 antibody for 1 h at 37°C. The next day, T cells purified from healthy donor PBMC were added to the wells together with the titrated 4-1BB/HER2 bispecific PRS-343 (filled circle) or trastuzumab as a control (dotted line). After three days in culture, IL-2 (A) and IFN-g, levels in the culture supernatants were measured by an Electrochemoluminescence immunoassay. In parallel, the experiment was performed in the presence of an excess of trastuzumab (340 nM) to inhibit the binding of PRS-343 to the SKBR3 cells, and IL-2 (C) and IFN-g (D) levels were measured.

In vivo proof of concept data utilizing a humanized SK-OV-3 mouse model demonstrated dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition compared to treatment with the isotype control (Figure 5). It is anticipated that the TGI in this model is predominantly caused by the anti-HER2. The anti-tumor response observed with PRS-343 was accompanied by a significantly higher tumor infiltration with human lymphocytes (hCD45+). Interestingly, the anti-4-1BB benchmark neither displayed tumor growth inhibition nor enhanced lymphocyte infiltration into tumors compared to isotype. The tras-IgG4 control was also devoid of lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor, but displayed a tumor growth inhibition comparable to PRS-343. Taken together, these data show that PRS-343 provided dual activity by both increasing the frequency of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes by bispecific targeting of CD137 and HER2 as well as mediating direct tumor growth inhibition by the direct, monospecific targeting of HER2.

PRS-332 targeting an undisclosed checkpoint target
PRS-332 is a bispecific Anticalin-antibody fusion protein comprising an anti-PD-1 antibody genetically fused to an Anticalin molecule targeting an undisclosed checkpoint target. Other drug candidates targeting the checkpoint molecule PD-1 include nivolumab, marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb (trade name Opdivo), and pembrolizumab, marketed by Merck, (trade name Keytruda). There are currently a number of approved PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors approve in the US. Anti-PD-1 antibodies have demonstrated great clinical benefit in several cancers, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck carcinomas, bladder cancer and others. However, there are many patients who do not respond, relapse or acquire resistance to PD-1 treatment. In order to improve on existing PD-1 therapies, Pieris in collaboration with Servier is developing PRS-332 with the intent to simultaneously block PD-1 and another immune checkpoint co-expressed on exhausted T cells.
Pipeline products: 300 Series
Current antibody-based therapies targeting tumor cell destruction or immune activation are hampered by, among other factors, low response rates and the induction of immune-related adverse events. The 300-Series Anticalin proteins are designed to target checkpoint proteins or, like PRS-343, immune-stimulatory proteins and consist of a variety of multifunctional biotherapeutics that can combine, via a genetic fusion, antibodies with Anticalin proteins or two or more Anticalin proteins to each other. These combined molecules have the potential to build upon current therapies through the capability of modifying or regulating one or more immune functions on a single fusion protein, thereby having the potential to elevate immune responses within a tumor microenvironment. We believe that a tethered Anticalin protein directed at checkpoint or co-stimulatory targets can preferentially activate the immune system at the site of the tumor microenvironment thus providing efficacy with enhanced therapeutic index. We believe that the 300-Series Anticalin proteins represent a “platform within a product” opportunity in IO since it may be possible to apply a single combined Anticalin-antibody molecule in a number of different cancers. This is based 
14

on the shared underlying biology such as checkpoint and costimulatory biology found within tumors arising in different organs. Pieris intends to expand and accelerate its IO pipeline, including anticipated IND filings in 2019.

PRS-060 targeting IL-4Rα in asthma
PRS-060 is an Anticalin drug candidate targeting IL-4Rα, a cell surface receptor expressed on immune cells in the lung epithelium and sub-mucosal layer. IL-4Rα is specific to the circulating cytokine IL-4 and the closely related cytokine IL-13, both key drivers of the immune system. PRS-060 is derived from human tear lipocalin, has picomolar affinity for human IL-4Rα (20 pM) and has a favorable stability profile. We showed in vitro that PRS-060 can inhibit the activity of both IL-4 and IL-13. We have developed a bioprocess that has generated GMP material for use in preclinical safety studies and first in human clinical studies; demonstrated that PRS-060 is sufficiently safe and well tolerated in preclinical safety studies to allow progression to first-in-human-clinical evaluation and that PRS-060 can be formulated for pulmonary delivery by inhalation. Our first-in-human clinical trial for PRS-060 was initiated in December 2017. We believe PRS-060 represents a first in class inhaled biologic targeting IL-4Rα for the treatment of asthma.
Asthma market
Asthma is a very common chronic airway disorder affecting approximately 300 million people worldwide according to the Global Initiative for Asthma and approximately 26 million Americans according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Of these 26 million, about 7 million are children. Asthma is responsible for 13 million physician visits a year including about 2 million emergency visits in the United States, according to the American Lung Association. In the United States between 2008-2013, asthma was responsible for $3 billion in losses from missed work and school days, $29 billion from asthma-related mortality, and $50.3 billion in medical costs. This resulted in a total cost of asthma in the U.S. of $81.9 billion in 2013 (Nurmagambetov, Kuwahara and Garbe, 2018, Annals of the American Thoracic Society, http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201703-259OC, In Press). 
Challenges in using conventional therapy
According to a 2016 Artisan Health Care Consulting analysis, asthma affects approximately 80 million people in the U.S. and Europe. The analysis determined that approximately 15%, or 12 million, of the group studied were considered >12 years old and have moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma.
The current standard of care for persistent, moderate to severe allergic asthma is high dose inhaled corticosteroids or ICS often in combination with inhaled long-acting beta-adrenergic agonists, or LABA. In very severe allergic asthma, omalizumab (Xolair from Roche) is given to patients in addition to ICS/LABA combinations. Omalizumab (Xolar®) was approved for this condition in the United States in 2003. Outside of the United States, omalizumab is approved for severe asthma. Omalizumab works by binding to the immune mediator immunoglobulin E, or IgE, and inhibiting IgE-mediated activation of mast cells and basophils, types of white blood cells. It has also been shown to impact some diseases, such as asthma, that are driven by eosinophils, another important class of immune cells. However, patient response to omalizumab has been shown to be inconsistent, as reported in a publication by McNicholl and Heaney in 2008 in the journal Core Evidence, which explained that in only some studies did omalizumab improve lung function. Furthermore, general asthma symptoms are also typically unaffected by omalizumab. Finally, in 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, issued a black box warning for omalizumab due to reported cases of anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction suffered by some patients who had taken the drug. Despite these shortcomings worldwide sales of omalizumab in 2015 were, according to a report by Datamonitor Healthcare published on September 19, 2016, $1.9 billion.
The next generation of therapies beyond omalizumab targets a broader range than just IgE mediated mechanisms. These approaches target other immune mediators, including IL-5, IL-4, IL-13, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, or TSLP, IL-33 (which act in concert on eosinophils, B cells, epithelial cells, goblet cells and others) and PGD2 (through stimulation of CRTH2 receptors). Asthma is associated with high levels of eosinophils, immune cells that play a role in protecting the body against infection. The creation of eosinophils can be interrupted at the early stages, while the cells are still maturing. Multiple products are approved that target eosinophils through IL-5 or its receptor IL-5RA. GlaxoSmithKline’s, or GSK's, mepolizumab (Nucala) which targets IL-5 was approved for severe eosinophilic asthma in adults and children older than 12 in 2015. Teva’s Cinqair also targeting IL-5 was approved in 2016 and more recently AstraZeneca’s Fansera, which targets the IL-5RA, was approved in November 2017. However, eosinophils are only one of many cell types and immune system components that are involved with the body’s exaggerated inflammation response in asthma. Mast cells, basophils, goblet cells and other cells also play a role. These cells can be seen infiltrating the airways along with eosinophils, leading to the conclusion that more cell types are 
15

involved in asthma pathogenesis. We believe that targeting just one of these components unlikely to be as effective in treating severe asthma as an approach that targets the broader Th2 (cell-mediated) pathway.
In 2017, Regeneron and its partner Sanofi reported that they had successfully completed a phase 3 study for dupilumab in severe, steroid-dependent asthma. Dupilumab (Dupixent), is a monoclonal antibody that targets IL-4Rα that is delivered subcutaneously and was approved for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in March 2017. In a 2013 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, Wenzel et al. reported that dupilumab showed a benefit on the asthma control questionnaire 5 (ACQ5) symptom score, a widely accepted measure for classifying the ability of a medication to control asthma. Patients dosed with dupilumab had fewer asthma attacks compared to placebo-treated patients when standard therapies, such as long-acting beta-agonists and inhaled glucocorticoids, were withdrawn, demonstrating the efficacy of dupilumab. Patients also showed improved lung function and reduced levels of Th2-associated inflammatory markers. Dupilumab is administered systemically through injection. In November 2014, Regeneron and Sanofi announced that in a Phase IIb study, dupilumab also demonstrated improved lung function and reduced exacerbations when administered together with standard of care. These effects were observed in both unselected severe asthma patients and selected patients presenting elevated Th2 responses. In their October 2017 press release Regeneron and Sanofi announced that dupilumab had met its primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints the Liberty Asthma Venture phase 3 study in adults and adolescents with severe, steroid dependent asthma. In the overall population, dupilumab reduced the use of oral corticosteroids (OCS) by 70% compared to 42% for patients on placebo. For patients with a high baseline eosinophilia (300 or greater eosinophilic cells/microliter) the reduction in OCS use was 80% compared to 43% for placebo. Dupilumab also reduced the number of exacerbations in the overall population by 59% and this reduction was greater (71%) in patients with high eosinophil counts. In addition, dupilumab compared to placebo also improved lung function, Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1), by 220ml in the overall population and 320ml in patients with high eosinophils. This data has not yet been published in a peer reviewed journal. The Liberty Asthma Quest phase 3 study showed that dupilumab, when added to the standard of care, reduced severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) by 46 percent in the overall population and 67 percent in patients with high eosinophils (300 or greater eosinophilic cells/microliter. The companies submitted a Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for dupilumab, for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 and over, to the FDA during the fourth quarter of 2017.
Advantages to inhalation as a route of administration for PRS-060
We have demonstrated that PRS-060 is sufficiently safe and well tolerated in inhalation toxicology studies in mice to allow progression to first-in-human-clinical evaluations, and we believe that overall it may have a better tolerability profile than systemically administered monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, we believe that PRS-060 could be produced at a lower cost of goods than mAbs because we will use manufacturing procedures that employ bacterial expression systems, which generally provides a cost advantage over mammalian production systems, typically used for mAbs. Since dosing by inhalation is a common route of administration in asthma patients, it could represent a more convenient dosage regimen for patients than dosing of antibodies by injection. PRS-060 could therefore be self-administered using a standard device rather than requiring a visit to a physician for the drug to be given.
Preclinical data
In in vitro assays, PRS-060 specifically bound to immobilized targets such as human IL-4Rα in a concentration-dependent manner. We tested the binding of PRS-060 to various targets in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, (ELISA) a standard in vitro assay platform. In these tests, PRS-060 bound to IL-4Rα with subnanomolar affinity and it did not bind to three other human cell-surface interleukin receptors (IL-6R, IL-18RA, IL-23RA). Furthermore, the activity of IL-4 and IL-13 was inhibited by PRS-060 in a dose-dependent manner. The below charts show the inhibition of IL-4 (left) or IL-13 (right) induced proliferation in human TF-1 cells in vitro by PRS-060.
16

In in vivo assays in mice genetically altered to express human IL-4Rα, human IL-4 and IL-13, low doses of PRS-060 inhibited the induction of eotaxin protein, a marker of airway inflammation, in lung tissue following pulmonary delivery. We observed this inhibition at both the RNA and protein levels compared both to buffer and to wild type tear lipocalin (control).
The below chart shows the duration of PRS-060-mediated inhibition of eotaxin gene expression, a marker of airway inflammation, in lung tissue by a single pulmonary dose in mice:

When we administered IL-13 into the lung of humanized mice (that express human IL-4, IL-13 and IL-4RA), inflammation was induced as determined by eotaxin expression, which was not inhibited when phosphate buffered saline, (PBS) or human wild type lipocalin was administered into the lung. In contrast to the PBS administration, increases in eotaxin expression were prevented when PRS-060 was administered into the lung before IL-13. As demonstrated in the above chart, the model showed the inhibitory potential lasts for up to 24 hours after PRS-060 administration. We have also demonstrated that PRS-060 reduces the inflammation associated with antigen challenge in a mouse asthma model. The chart below shows that pre-treatment with PRS-060 reduces the lung levels of the key inflammatory cells eosinophils and lymphocytes, a profile that supports the hypothesis that lung delivery of an IL-4Rα antagonist to asthmatics may be viable approach to the treatment of asthma.
PRS-080 targeting hepcidin in CKD-related FID-anemia
PRS-080 is an Anticalin drug candidate targeting hepcidin, a peptide mediator that is an important negative regulator of iron absorption and storage, derived from the naturally occurring human lipocalin known as NGAL. The normal function of hepcidin is to maintain equilibrium in iron supply for red blood cell production by binding to ferroportin, the protein that transports iron from the inside of a cell to the outside, inducing its internalization and subsequent degradation. The binding of hepcidin to ferroportin reduces the iron uptake from the intestine into the body and inhibits iron mobilization from cellular stores into red blood cells. An excess amount of hepcidin can cause functional iron deficiency (FID), which often cannot be treated adequately with iron supplements and can lead to anemia. According to a 2009 publication by Young and Zaritsky in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, lowering hepcidin levels or antagonizing its actions would reverse the negative effects of inflammation on red blood cell formation by allowing mobilization of stored iron and improved iron absorption.
PRS-080 has been designed to target hepcidin for the treatment of FID in anemic patients with CKD, particularly in end-stage renal disease patients requiring dialysis, to allow them to mobilize iron that is trapped in iron storage cells for use in the creation of red blood cells. We have also engineered PRS-080 to have a half-life of less than a week, so that following administration, it is expected to clear from the human body in a much shorter timeframe than antibodies, which typically have a 
17

half-life of two weeks or greater. This half-life was achieved by covalently linking PRS-080 to a specific polyethylene glycol, or PEG, in order to extend the serum half-life of the combined molecule to desirable levels. Since hepcidin is constantly produced by the body, we believe that a frequent, e.g. once per week, dosing interval will be optimally suited to interfere with hepcidin function. A shorter half-life than mAbs may be more compatible with this dosing schedule. A longer mAb-like residence time is not seen as advantageous, but rather could lead to the accumulation of both the drug and the target beyond the typical residence time of hepcidin, resulting in large quantities of hepcidin bound to mAbs. We completed a Phase Ia single-ascending dose clinical trial with PRS-080 in healthy volunteers in 2015. The trial was conducted in accordance with German law at a clinical site in Neu-Ulm, Germany, that belongs to Nuvisan GmbH, our contract research organization, or CRO. Results from this trial were presented at the 2015 Annual Conference of the American Society of Hematology (http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/126/23/536). Based on the data obtained. we initiated a Phase Ib clinical study in CKD 5 patients requiring hemodialysis which we completed in February 2017. The company initiated a multi-dose clinical study in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis in the third quarter of 2017, which is assessing the safety and tolerability of multi-dose administration of PRS-080, as well as a secondary assessment of repeated doses of PRS-080 on hemoglobin levels over a period of approximately one month.
Anemia and functional iron deficiency in the CKD population
Anemia is a serious medical condition in which blood is deficient in red blood cells, and hemoglobin, leading to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and cells throughout the body. Anemia is generally said to exist when hemoglobin is less than 13 g/dL in men and 12 g/dL in women. Anemia has a number of potential causes, including nutritional deficiencies, iron deficiency, bone marrow disease, medications, and abnormalities in production of or sensitivity to erythropoietin, a hormone that controls red blood cell production. Anemia is a frequent and severe consequence of CKD. In addition, within the CKD population, anemia may be caused by FID. FID exists when, despite adequate stores, iron cannot be mobilized for erythropoiesis. In this case, despite treatment with exogenous erythropoietin and iron supplements, “functional” iron is still deficient. FID-anemic patients can be identified and selected for therapy using marketed laboratory tests for iron metabolism. According to the results of a 2017 research analysis conducted for us by Artisan Healthcare Consulting, there were an estimated 505,000 individuals with ESRD that were on hemodialysis in the US in 2017 and approximately 90% of these patients are treated with ESA. Up to 50% of the ESRD patients on hemodialysis that are currently treated with ESA have FID. Approximately 15% of the FID patients are still anemic despite ESA treatment. Based on the estimated 505,000 individuals with ESRD on hemodialysis, we believe that approximately 34,000 individuals are FID-anemic despite ESA treatment in the US.
Challenges in using conventional therapy
We believe CKD patients with FID-anemia are especially poorly served. These patients have adequate stores of iron but this iron is not efficiently incorporated into red blood cell precursors through rESAs and iron supplements. According to the 2009 publication by Young and Zaritsky in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, this imbalance in iron metabolism is a result of a high level of circulating hepcidin in the blood stream. We believe existing therapies are limited in that they do not have an impact on hepcidin or, in the case of rESAs, patients often become resistant to the therapy.
Our potential solution: binding hepcidin with PRS-080
We have engineered PRS-080 so that it binds to hepcidin and reduces the impact of hepcidin’s negative regulation on iron mobilization. We believe that by blocking the actions of hepcidin, PRS-080 will serve to address anemia by mobilizing iron for incorporation into red blood cells.
In patients suffering from anemia of CKD, and specifically in patients with FID, hepcidin is chronically produced by the body in abnormally large amounts. Therefore, we believe that the best way to inhibit its function is to administer an inhibitor on a repeated basis, such as once a week. Our approach will use PRS-080 in connection with a conjugated PEG30 molecule, a well-known half-life extender, in order to allow the drug sufficient residence time in the body. Once coupled to PEG30, PRS-080 is intended to have a half-life that will be optimally suited for dosing anemic patients with CKD. In contrast, antibodies typically have a half-life of two to three weeks. Such a long half-life renders antibodies unsuitable for frequent administration and elimination of a circulating target protein like hepcidin because such antibodies tend to accumulate the target after binding due to their own long residence time in the body with the associated risk of bound hepcidin being released by antibodies that are still circulating in the blood.
Preclinical data
18

Hepcidin binds to ferroportin and induces its internalization and subsequent degradation, thus disabling iron mobilization from cells. PRS-080 binds strongly to hepcidin and inhibits its activity in a dose dependent manner as shown in in vitro potency assays. PRS-080 is able to completely inhibit the internalization of FPN above a concentration of 20 nM. 
Our preclinical studies targeted the cynomolgus monkey orthologue of hepcidin, which has a high degree of similarity (96% identity) with human hepcidin. PRS-080 was found to bind with high affinity to the cynomolgus monkey version of hepcidin. 
We performed a dose finding study in cynomolgus monkeys, testing intravenous 30-minute infusions as well as subcutaneous injections of PRS-080 to study PK properties of PRS-080 and the functional consequences of hepcidin inhibition on iron mobilization. A dose of 1 mg/kg PRS-080 produced a robust, transient and reversible increase in total iron levels from approximately 36 µM at baseline to 52 µM after 8 hours. Doses higher than 1 mg/kg elevated serum iron concentrations to comparable levels and, in a dose-dependent manner, prolonged the response. A linear correlation was observed over time between the PRS-080 dose and increase of serum iron concentrations. The PK properties of PRS-080 were investigated after a single administration at doses ranging from 20 mg/kg to 150 mg/kg. The concentration over time profiles of PRS-080 showed standard drug-like properties, as the kinetics were dose proportional and there was a low volume of distribution. Elimination of PRS-080 occurred with a terminal half-life of about 2 days, which can be extrapolated to translate to 3 days in humans.
We also carried out a 4-week repeated dose toxicology study with intravenous infusions of PRS-080 for 30 minutes every other day. Our work included toxicokinetic and ADA measurements. During the study, safety pharmacology parameters on the cardiovascular system and respiration were monitored and all safety endpoints were met. Our preclinical studies also examined a different NGAL-derived Anticalin, or surrogate molecule, which targets rat hepcidin in a rat model of inflammation-induced anemia. In these studies, administration of the surrogate molecule once per day or every other day inhibited the manifestation of anemia in the rats over the course of a three-week period.
The 4-week repeated PRS-080 dosing to cynomolgus monkeys was well tolerated up to the highest tested dose of 120 mg/kg. This dose was classified as producing no adverse events: routine laboratory tests and blood cell examinations did not demonstrate any adverse findings and safety pharmacology investigations were also without adverse events. As a result of the hepcidin inhibition, the study showed increased iron uptake and storage, for example in the liver, and mobilization.
The functional consequence of PRS-080 treatment on bone marrow activity and red blood cell production, or hematopoiesis, by means of hemoglobin (an oxygen transporting protein contained in red blood cells) concentration in reticulocytes, a precursor of red blood cells, was investigated in cynomolgus monkeys following repeated administration. As shown in the below chart, after administration of PRS-080 either intravenously (i.v. 150 mg/kg) or subcutaneously (s.c. 20 mg/kg), elevated hemoglobin concentrations in reticulocytes (Retic CH) were observed on day 30 compared to pre-treatment (pre-dose).

Phase I trial design and results
The Phase Ia trial of PRS-080 was conducted in healthy volunteers at a clinical site in Neu-Ulm, Germany by Nuvisan GmbH, a CRO. The study was a single dose escalating, blinded, placebo controlled study at a dose range from 0.2 to 40 mg/kg (equivalent to 0.08 to 16.0 mg/kg based on protein content). Forty-eight subjects were dosed with PRS-080 or a placebo. This study was governed and approved by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, or BfArM) and the local Ethics Committee. Treatment of subjects began at the end of 2014 and was completed in June 2015, followed by evaluation of the data.
PRS-080 was well tolerated. All treatment emergent Adverse Events, or AEs, were either mild or moderate and no Serious AEs were observed. No association of AEs to specific organs and no apparent dose dependency or difference between placebo and active treatment was observed. Notably, no hypersensitivity or infusion reactions were noted and vital signs, body temperature and electrocardiograms were unchanged. Pharmacokinetics of PRS-080 were dose-proportional with a half-life of approximately 3 days. PRS-080 administration resulted in an immediate decrease in plasma hepcidin concentration, which was followed by an increase in serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation. As shown in the figure below, the duration of 
19

this response in iron and transferrin saturation increased dose-dependently from about 25 hours at the lower dose to about 185 hours at the highest dose.
Phase Ib trial in anemic CKD 5 patient
Based on this positive safety and pharmacological activity we initiated a Phase lb study in CKD 5 patients undergoing hemodialysis and suffering from FID-anemia earlier in 2016. This study was governed and approved by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, or BfArM). It was a multi-center, randomized and double blinded Phase Ib trial studying single PRS-080 administrations at 3 dose levels, 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg bw. This study was completed in the first quarter of 2017. In each dose group 6 patients were treated with PRS-080 and 2 patients with placebo. PRS-080 was well tolerated and shown to be safe in all dose groups. There was only one SAE (worsening of dry gangrene in a patient with long standing diabetic foot syndrome) Vital signs, physical examination, and electrocardiograms were not affected by the treatment with PRS-080. No differences in the safety analysis were observed between placebo and drug. There was no evidence of immunogenicity in the single ascending dose study. 
Pharmacokinetics shows a dose-proportional increase for free and total PRS-080 with a dose peak plasma concentration at 1 hour (tmax) and a rapid decrease over the following 19 hours.
The magnitude of iron mobilization by PRS-080 was dose-dependent with increases in both serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation (TSAT) following treatment. The maximal concentrations (Cmax) of iron and TSAT were reached within 19 hours in all three dose groups. A return to baseline values were reached after 2, 3, and 5 days after the end of infusions of 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg PRS-080, respectively. 
20

The figure below shows mean serum concentration of iron during the study:

The figure below shows mean TSAT during the study:
Subsequently and due to the good safety profile and iron mobilization of PRS-080, a multi-center, placebo controlled ascending dose pilot Phase IIa trial has been initiated to study the safety, pharmacokinetics and effects of hepcidin inhibition on iron mobilization by 5 weekly doses of PRS-080 in 4 and 8 mg/kg patient cohorts. In addition first results on hemoglobin levels in CKD patients will be examined as a secondary outcome measure. In total 12 patients will be included; in each group 4 patients will be treated with PRS-080 and 2 patients with placebo. This Phase IIa study started in September 2017 and is ongoing in clinical centers in Germany and Czech Republic. The German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, or BfArM) and the Czech State Institute of Drug Control (SUKL) approve and govern the study. First results should be available in the second half of 2018.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience, scientific knowledge and strategies provide us with competitive advantages, we face and will continue to face intense competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, both in the United States and abroad.
21

We compete, or will compete, with existing and new therapies that may become available in the future. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that our drug candidates target. Any drug candidates that we are able to develop and commercialize will compete with existing and new drugs being developed by our competitors. Our competitors may develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that may be commercialized by us, or may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.
The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, some of which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products and many of which are bigger than us and have more institutional experience and greater cash flows than we have, may have competitive advantages over us, as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product licenses and/or acquisitions. In addition, a number of established research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may acquire products in late stages of development to augment their internal product lines, which may provide those companies with an even greater competitive advantage.
There are a number of other companies presently working to develop therapies for anemia, asthma, and oncology, including divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes. There are also a variety of available drug therapies marketed for these diseases. Our drug candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, and to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our drug candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. As a result, market acceptance of, and a significant share of the market for, any of our drug candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges.
In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of drugs in clinical development to treat anemia, asthma, or cancer. These medicines in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience, and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies and may not be provided by any of our current or future product candidates. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates.
Many of our competitors will have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in some of our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build, obtain regulatory approval for and market acceptance of, and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy.
In addition, our competitors may have a variety of drugs in development or awaiting market approval that could reach the market and become established before we have a product to sell. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any drugs that we may develop. Many of our competitors are using technologies or methods different or similar to ours to identify and validate drug targets and to discover novel small molecule drugs. Many of our competitors and their collaborators have significantly greater experience than we do in the following:


• | identifying and validating targets;


• | screening compounds against targets;


• | preclinical and clinical trials of potential pharmaceutical products; and


• | obtaining regulatory clearances.

In addition, many of our competitors and their collaborators have substantially greater advantages in the following areas:


• | capital resources;


• | research and development resources;


• | manufacturing capabilities; and


• | sales and marketing.

22

Smaller companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors have products that have been approved by the FDA, or its foreign counterparts, or are in advanced development. We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Developments by others may render our product candidates or our technologies obsolete. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.
PRS-300 series
Under the 300-series, Pieris is developing multispecific immuno-oncology drug candidates. This includes tumor-targeted co-stimulatory molecules, such as PRS-343, and multispecific checkpoint inhibitors, such as PRS-332.
The rationale behind the multispecific tumor-targeted co-stimulatory molecules is to activate the immune system in the tumor microenvironment. Other companies that also develop multispecific drug candidates designed to activate the immune system in a tumor dependent manner by targeting a co-stimulatory receptor, such as 4-1BB, include Roche, Molecular Partners, Alligator Biosciences, and Aptevo Therapeutics. Additionally, there are multiple of drug candidates in clinical trials solely targeting a co-stimulatory receptors including 4-1BB, OX40, GITR, and CD27. 
The first checkpoint inhibitor, Ipilimumab, targeting CTLA-4 was approved for the treatment of melanoma patients in 2011 and is being marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Nivolumab from Bristol-Myers Squibb was approved for the treatment of melanoma in 2014 as the first PD-1 inhibitor. Pembrolizumab from Merck & Co was the second PD-1 inhibitor to be approved and the first one in the US. In addition to Nivolumab and Prembrolizumab there are multiple approved checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway e.g. from Roche, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck KGaA. 
There are also drug candidates in preclinical or clinical testing for other checkpoint targets such as LAG3, TIM3 and B7-H3. Companies developing either dual-checkpoint inhibitors or combinations of two or more monospecific checkpoint inhibitors includes Xencor, F-star, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merus, Tesaro, Novartis, Merck & Co among others. 
Additionally, a number of other companies, such as Amgen, Affimed, Macrogenics, F-Star Molecular Partners, Xencor, Immunocore and Zymeworks, also pursue other multispecific approaches in oncology, which therapies are in clinical or preclinical development.
PRS-343
PRS-343 is bispecific Anticalin-antibody fusion protein targeting 4-1BB and HER2. The mode of action of PRS-343 is to promote 4-1BB clustering by bridging 4-1BB-positive T cells with HER2-positive tumor cells, and to thereby provide a potent costimulatory signal to tumor antigen-specific T cells. Other drug candidates targeting the co-stimulatory receptor 4-1BB include urelumab, which is being developed by Bristol Myers Squibb, and Utomilumab (PF-05082566), which is being developed by Pfizer, both of which are currently in clinical development (Sitetrove, January 13, 2018). In the HER2-positive space, several companies are active with approved, clinical and preclinical drugs candidates. The most prominent company is Roche, having three approved drugs on the market through its subsidiary Genentech. The first drug from Roche targeting HER2 is Trastuzumab, which has been marketed for treatment of breast cancer patients since 1998 and for gastric cancer patients since 2010. The two other drugs are Pertuzumab and Ado-trastuzumab Emtansine which both are marketed for breast cancer patients. In addition to PRS-343, there are also other HER2 targeting drug candidates in clinical development designed to induce an immune response by bridging HER2-postive tumor cell with immune cells e.g. GBR 1302, a bispecific antibody targeting HER2 and CD3, from Glenmark (Pharmaprojects, January 13, 2018). 
One company has publicly disclosed a competitor program to PRS-343. MacroGenics presented data on a HER2 and 4-1BB (41BB) bispecific during their R&D day on December 13th, 2016. In addition to MacroGenics other companies have also disclosed 4-1BB-based bispecific drug candidates. Roche and Molecular Partners have both presented data on bispecific drug candidates targeting Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and 4-1BB. Alligator Bioscience together with Aptevo Therapeutics have disclosed a 4-1BB-based bispecific drug candidate targeting 5T4. However, the 4-1BB-based bispecific drug candidates targeting FAP or 5T4 does not constitute direct competition to PRS-343 since they are targeting a different tumor target and will, thus, likely be developed in different indications or patient populations. 
23

Additionally, other companies such as AstraZeneca, Novartis, Merck, Agenus, Five Prime Therapeutics, Seattle Genetics, GlaxoSmithKline and Celldex have preclinical and clinical development programs focusing on other co-stimulatory targets which include OX40, CD40, GITR, CD27 and ICOS.
PRS-332
PRS-332 is a bispecific Anticalin-antibody fusion protein comprising an anti-PD-1 antibody genetically fused to an Anticalin protein targeting an undisclosed checkpoint target. Other drug candidates targeting the checkpoint molecule PD-1 include Nivolumab, marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb, and Pembrolizumab, marketed by Merck & Co. Anti-PD-1 antibodies have demonstrated great clinical benefit in several cancers, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck carcinomas. However, there are many patients who do not respond, relapse or acquire resistance to PD-1 treatment. In order to improve on existing PD-1 therapies, Pieris is developing PRS-332 with the intent to simultaneously block PD-1 and another immune checkpoint co-expressed on exhausted T cells.
Additionally, other companies such as Merck & Co, Bristol-Meyer Squibb, Xencor, Tesaro, and Novartis are developing drugs targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 an additionally checkpoint target either as a combination product or as a bispecific dual checkpoint inhibitor. The other checkpoint target in such approaches include CTLA-4, LAG-3 and TIM-3.
PRS-060
Like PRS-060, new developments for the treatment of uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma patients mainly include drug candidates targeting the Th2 pathway by interfering with IL-4/IL-13, IL-5 actions or thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Such agents include dupilumab (Sanofi/Regeneron, IL-4RA), mepolizumab (Nucala) (GSK, IL-5), reslizumab (Cinqair) (Teva, IL-5), benralizumab (Fasenra) (Astra Zeneca, IL-5RA) and tezepelumab (Amgen/AstraZeneca, TSLP),). These drugs are in later clinical development (Phase II) than PRS-060, or have been approved (mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab) for severe eosinophilic asthma; the mAb omalizumab, directed against IgE, is also approved and marketed for the treatment of uncontrolled, moderate to severe asthma patients. However, in contrast to PRS-060, these mAbs are given to patients through injection and distribute systemically through the blood stream. CSJ117 (Novartis), an inhaled fAb fragment that targets TSLP, is currently in Phase I clinical development. There are a number of other companies presently marketing or developing other therapies for asthmatic patients. 
PRS-080
There are very few other drug candidates in development that interfere with hepcidin function or expression. Nucleic acid based approaches that were in preclinical development by IONIS/Xenon and Alnylam have been suspended for unknown reasons. Noxxon’s RNA aptamer NOX-H94 has completed Phase II clinical studies in cancer and ESRD patients. While an increase of Hb values was seen in cancer patients, no such effect could be confirmed in the ESRD population. We are not aware of any ongoing development for NOX-H94. PRS-080 is significantly more potent and has a longer half-life than NOX-H94. We therefore believe that Noxxon’s results are not predictive for efficacy of PRS-080. Lilly has been developing a mAb against hepcidin in cancer as well as chronic kidney disease patients as well as a mAb against the ferroportin transporter. The latter has been suspended for unknown reasons and there has been no update on the anti-hepcidin mAb from Lilly since 2015. Ferrumax develops a soluble form of hemojuvelin, a protein that regulates hepcidin expression and iron metabolism that aims to suppress the production rate of hepcidin.
There are also a number of companies which are focused on treating anemia in CKD patients under alternative approaches. Fibrogen (in partnership with Astellas and AstraZeneca), Akebia Therapeutics (in partnership with Mitsubishi Tanabe and Otsuka), GSK, Bayer, Daiichi Sankyo, Zydus Cadila and Japan Tobacco have hypoxia-inducible-factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitors in clinical development that target stimulation of bone marrow activity. Fibrogen reported positive topline results from phase 3 trials in China with its HIF-PH inhibitor Roxadustat (in January 2017). Akebia recently reported positive results from a Phase II trial in Asia with its HIF-PH inhibitor Vadadustat (January 2018). Multiple phase 3 trials are currently ongoing with different HIF-PH inhibitors in both dialysis-dependent as well as dialysis-independent CKD patients. Acceleron is targeting the sequestration of Activin A, a natural inhibitor of hematopoiesis, is in a Phase II clinical study. Auryxia by Keryx, which is an oral, absorbable, iron-based phosphate binder, completed a phase 3 in non-dialysis dependent CKD 3-5 patients in 2016 and announced topline results showing that the study met the primary and all pre-specified secondary endpoints including change in Hb values. Keryx filed a New Drug Application, or NDA for the CKD indication with the FDA in November 2017. There are also various companies conducting late-stage development of erythropoietin biosimilars.

Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturers, or CMOs, for the manufacture of our drug candidates for larger scale preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial quantities of any drug candidates that are approved.
We currently rely on multiple CMOs for all of our clinical supplies, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), drug substances and finished drug products, and label & packaging for our preclinical research and clinical trials, including the Phase IIa trial for PRS-080, the Phase I trial for PRS-343 and the Phase I trial for PRS-060
We believe that we will be able to contract with other CMOs to obtain APIs if our existing sources of APIs were no longer available or sufficient, but there is no assurance that APIs would be available from other third-party manufacturers on acceptable terms, on the timeframe that our business would require, or at all. We do not have supply commitments or other arrangements in place with our existing CMOs. We also do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply of bulk drug substance.
We do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of any of our drug candidates if they are approved, and we intend to enter into agreements with a third-party contract manufacturer and one or more back-up manufacturers for the commercial production of our product candidates as they near potential approval.
Any drug products to be used in clinical trials and any approved product that we may commercialize will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice requirements and comparable requirements of the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval. We currently employ internal resources to manage our manufacturing contractors.
We believe that PRS-080, PRS-060, and PRS 343 and our other Anticalin®-branded drug candidates can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible biologic processes from readily available starting materials. PRS-080 and PRS-060 are produced using bacterial expression systems similar to those that have been used in the past for the production of other proteins and which systems are widely used in the industry. PRS-343 is produced using a mammalian expression system similar to those systems which are widely used in the industry for the production of antibodies. We believe that the manufacturing process is amenable to scale-up and will not require unusual or expensive equipment. We expect to continue to develop, on our own or with our collaborators, drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
Intellectual Property and Exclusivity
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain exclusivity of our proprietary Anticalin technologies through intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, libraries of different protein scaffolds and consensus sequences, and the fundamental Anticalin platform technology, including novel therapeutic and diagnostic discoveries, as well as other proprietary know-how, and to operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others.
We seek to protect our exclusive position of Anticalin technologies by, among other means, prosecuting our own international, U.S., and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We have established intellectual property protection in relation to our Anticalin technologies in key global markets, including in North America, Europe and Asia. We believe we have patent exclusivity relating to drug candidates derived from lipocalin proteins that runs until at least 2018 in the United States. We also rely on trade secrets for confidential know-how, which we generally seek to protect through contractual (e.g. confidentiality) agreements with employees and third parties.
We have protected the goodwill of our Company and our drug candidates, created through innovation and development, by putting in place trademark registrations of the Pieris and Anticalin marks as well as several defensive registrations.
We currently, and expect that we will continue to, file patent applications and maintain granted patents directed to our key drug candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions relating to new compositions of matter for these drug candidates, as well as novel medical applications of these compounds in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of various indications. We also intend to seek patent protection, if available, with respect to biomarkers that may contribute to selecting the right patient population for use of any of our drug candidates, or with respect to pharmaceutical formulations that may be useful to produce final medicinal products.
25

We own or are the exclusive licensee of a patent portfolio consisting of several issued U.S. patents, and their respective counterparts in a number of foreign jurisdictions, several pending applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, multiple pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding pending patent applications in a number of foreign jurisdictions as well as three pending provisional patent applications, as described in further detail below.
In applicable jurisdictions, we will seek patent term extensions for certain patents of ours, including the patent term adjustment period in the United States. If we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates in the United States or in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, we may be eligible for regulatory protection, such as twelve years of data exclusivity for new biological entities in the United States and as mentioned below, up to five years of patent term extension potentially available in the United States, eight to eleven years of data and marketing exclusivity potentially available for new drugs in the European Union, up to five years of patent extension in Europe (supplemental protection certificate), and eight years of data exclusivity potentially available in Japan. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for any such regulatory exclusivity, or that any such exclusivity will prevent competitors from seeking approval solely on the basis of their own studies. See “—Government Regulation.”
Certain patents we own are directed to the basic Anticalin protein concept and platform technology (i.e. antagonist or agonist compounds derived from a natural lipocalin protein) and are expected to expire in 2018, subject to any patent term adjustments and terminal disclaimers in the United States. In addition, we hold issued patents and patent applications in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, which patents are related to libraries of different scaffolds and consensus sequences such as human apolipoprotein D, human neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, or hNGAL, and human tear lipocalin, and are expected to expire between 2020 and 2030, subject to any patent term adjustments and terminal disclaimers in the United States. We also own a number of patents and patent applications at various stages of prosecution directed towards compositions of mater and in some cases, formulations or methods of use, of our preclinical and clinical drug candidates. Where possible, we will pursue patent term adjustments in the United States and any applicable foreign jurisdictions.
As a result of research efforts to date under the Research and License Agreement with Technische Universität München, or TUM, we hold a worldwide exclusive license to multiple patents and patent applications. These patents and patent applications relate to Anticalin proteins specific for the T cell co-receptor CD4and hNGAL lipocalin muteins and/or a library of an hNGAL scaffold of a certain consensus sequence, which patent is expected to expire in 2029, subject to any patent term adjustments or terminal disclaimers in the United States. We also hold an exclusive license to patents or patent applications related to bacterial lipocalin muteins.
As of the date of this report, a significant portion of our pending U.S. patent applications and pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions were directed to newly-discovered or improved scaffold libraries of lipocalin muteins, compounds derived therefrom (i.e., specific drug candidates), or the uses of such compounds to treat, prevent and mitigate certain diseases and conditions whose pathological development involve the targets of interest as well as to diagnose, prognose and select treatments for the diseases and conditions. We would expect that any patents that may issue from the pending U.S. patent applications would likely expire between 2029 and 2038 without taking into account possible patent term adjustments or other extensions, however, any and all of these patent applications may not result in issued patents, and not all issued patents may be maintained in force for their entire term. We are actively pursuing intellectual property protection for our immuno-oncology drug candidates in key global markets that, if granted, could expire as late as 2038 or later depending on the date of the filing of such patent applications.
In addition to patents, we hold trademarks in the United States for the Anticalin and Pieris marks. Similarly, we hold their respective counterparts, either as registered trademarks or as pending applications, in a number of foreign jurisdictions. We expect that we will continue to look for trademark protection for the goodwill associated with our Company and our drug candidates in the countries or regions where we will have investment, research and development, sales or other activities.
We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive advantage. We strive to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements and/or invention assignment agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also actively manage our publication and patent applications in that we only disclose information necessary to stir scientific interest or demonstrate patentability without materially compromising the secrecy of our valuable trade secrets and know-how. While we consider trade secrets and know-how to be a critical component of our intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, with respect to our technology platform, we anticipate that these trade secrets and know-how will, over the course of time, be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology and the movement of personnel skilled in the technology from academic to industry positions and 
26

vice versa. As a result, those proprietary trade secrets and know-how may lose their value to us over a period of time, and we may lose any competitive advantage afforded by them, as they become public knowledge.
Strategic Partnerships and Other License Agreements
Since 2007, we have entered into several strategic partnerships and other license or option agreements to complement our drug discovery and development. Specifically, we have entered into strategic partnerships with Servier, AstraZeneca and Seattle Genetics (collectively, the "Strategic Partnerships") and other, non-strategic license or option agreements with Aska, Roche, Sanofi, Allergan Sales, LLC, Allergan, Inc., and Allergan Pharmaceuticals Holdings (Ireland) Unlimited Company, or (collectively) Allergan, Cadila Healthcare Limited, or Zydus, and Strides Arcolab Limited, or Stelis (collectively, the "Other License Agreements"), Under the Strategic Partnerships and License Agreements, we have developed and conducted or will develop and conduct selection and screening of drug candidates, as well as in vitro potency and efficacy testing, using our Anticalin®-brand drug discovery platform, our Anticalin libraries, and other proprietary methods to generate, identify, and characterize drug candidates against certain biological targets associated with several diseases. The Strategic Partnerships and License Agreements have provided us with approximately €60.1 million ($67.4 million) in revenue to date. With respect to discontinued agreements, we have no ongoing performance obligations, and do not expect to receive any significant additional consideration pursuant to those agreements.
Our Strategic Partnerships and License Agreements are ongoing and, under which, our partners are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize drug candidates identified in the course of the collaboration. We are entitled to receive from our partners’ research, development and regulatory milestone payments and, in some cases, including the Servier and AstraZeneca collaborations, royalties on net sales for products developed and commercialized under these collaborations. With respect to our Strategic Partnerships, we have commercial rights, including the option to co-develop or co-commercialize one or more therapeutic programs with the applicable partners. We plan to continue to actively seek out additional collaboration partners that fit within our corporate development strategy.
The Strategic Partnerships represent the Company's cornerstone collaborations in its key therapeutic areas of immuno-oncology and respiratory diseases and include co-development and co-commercialization options. Certain terms and conditions of these Strategic Partnerships are summarized below:
Our collaboration with Servier
On January 4, 2017, we, along with Pieris GmbH, entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement and a Non-Exclusive Platform License Agreement with Servier. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, we, along with Servier, will initially pursue five bispecific therapeutic programs, including our PRS-332 program. We will jointly develop PRS-332 and split commercial rights geographically, with Pieris retaining all commercial rights in the U.S. and Servier having commercial rights in the rest of the world. The four additional committed programs, which have been defined, may combine antibodies from the Servier portfolio with one or more Anticalin proteins based on our proprietary platform to generate innovative IO bispecific drug candidates. The collaboration may be expanded by up to three additional therapeutic programs. We also have the option to co-develop and retain commercial rights in the U.S. for up to three programs beyond PRS-332, while Servier will be responsible for development and commercialization of the other programs worldwide.
Under the agreements, we received an upfront payment of €30 million (approximately $32.0 million). We may also receive funding for full time staff for specific projects, as well as development-dependent and commercial milestone payments for PRS-332 and each additional program. The total development, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments to us could exceed €1.7 billion (approximately $1.8 billion) over the life of the collaboration and are dependent on the final number of projects pursued and the number of co-development options exercised by us. We will share preclinical and clinical development costs for each co-developed program with Servier. In addition, we will be entitled to receive tiered royalties up to low double digits on the sales of commercialized products in the Servier territories.
The term of each agreement ends upon the expiration of all of Servier’s payment obligations under such agreement. The agreements may be terminated by Servier for convenience beginning 12 months after their effective date upon 180 days’ notice. The agreements may also be terminated by either of us for material breach upon 90 days’ or 120 days’ notice of a material breach, with respect to the collaboration agreement and license agreement, respectively, provided that the applicable party has not cured such breach by the applicable 90-day or 120-day permitted cure period, and dispute resolution procedures specified in the applicable Agreement have been followed. The agreements may also be terminated due to the other party’s insolvency or for a safety issue and may in certain instances be terminated on a product-by-product and/or country-by-country basis. The license agreement will terminate upon termination of the collaboration agreement, on a product-by-product and/or country-by-country basis.
27

Our Collaboration with AstraZeneca
On May 2, 2017, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement, and a Non-Exclusive Anticalin Platform Technology License Agreement with AstraZeneca (the "AstraZeneca Agreements"), which became effective on June 10, 2017, following expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Under the AstraZeneca Agreements the parties will advance several novel inhaled Anticalin proteins. 
Under the AstraZeneca Agreements, we received an upfront, non-refundable payment of $45.0 million. In addition, we have initiated a Phase I trial for the AstraZeneca Lead Product PRS-060 (AZD1402) for which we will receive a $12.5 million upfront payment. We are also eligible to receive research, development, commercial, sales milestone payments, and royalty payments. The total potential milestones are categorized as follows: research, development, and commercial milestones - up to $1.1 billion; and sales milestones - up to $1.0 billion. We may receive tiered royalties on sales of potential products commercialized by AstraZeneca and for co-developed products, gross margin share on worldwide sales equal dependent on our level of committed investment. 
The term of the AstraZeneca Agreements ends upon the expiration of all of AstraZeneca’s payment obligations under such AstraZeneca Agreements. The AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by AstraZeneca in its entirety for convenience beginning 12 months after its effective date upon 90 days’ notice or, if we have obtained marketing approval for the marketing and sale of a product, a 180 days’ notice. Each program may be terminated at AstraZeneca’s option; if any program is terminated by AstraZeneca, we will have full rights to such program. The AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by AstraZeneca or us for material breach upon 180 days’ notice of a material breach (or 30 days with respect to payment breach), provided that the applicable party has not cured such breach by the permitted cure period (including an additional 180 days if the breach is not susceptible to cure during the initial 180-day period) and dispute resolution procedures specified in the applicable AstraZeneca Agreement have been followed. The AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated due to the other party’s insolvency and may in certain instances be terminated on a product-by-product and/or country-by-country basis. Each party may also terminate the agreement if the other party challenges the validity of patents related to certain intellectual property licensed under the AstraZeneca Agreement, subject to certain exceptions for infringement suits, acquisitions and newly-acquired licenses. The License Agreement will terminate upon termination of the AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement, on a product-by-product and/or country-by-country basis. 
Our Collaboration with Seattle Genetics 
On February 8, 2018, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement and a Non-Exclusive Anticalin® Platform Technology License Agreement (collectively the “Seattle Genetics Agreements”) with Seattle Genetics, pursuant to which the parties will develop multiple targeted bispecific immuno-oncology treatments for solid tumors and blood cancers.
Under the terms of the Seattle Genetics Agreements, Seattle Genetics paid us a $30 million upfront fee, tiered royalties on net sales up to the low double-digits, and will pay us up to $1.2 billion in total success-based payments across three product candidates. The companies will pursue multiple antibody-Anticalin fusion proteins during a research phase, and Seattle Genetics has the option to select up to three therapeutic programs for further development. Prior to the initiation of a pivotal trial, we may opt into global co-development and U.S. commercialization of the second program and share in global costs and profits on a 50/50 basis. Seattle Genetics will solely develop, fund and commercialize the other two programs. Seattle Genetics may also decide to select additional candidates from the initial research phase for further development in return for the payment to us of additional fees, milestone payments, and royalties.
The term of each of the Seattle Genetics Agreements ends upon the expiration of all of Seattle Genetics’ payment obligations under such Agreement. The License and Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by Seattle Genetics in its entirety for convenience beginning 12 months after its effective date upon 90 days’ notice or, for any program where a pivotal study has been initiated, upon 180 days’ notice. Any program may be terminated at Seattle Genetics’ option. If any program is terminated by Seattle Genetics after a pre-defined pre-clinical stage, we will have full rights to continue such program. If any program is terminated by Seattle Genetics prior to such pre-defined pre-clinical stage, we will have the right to continue to develop such program, but will be obligated to offer a co-development option to Seattle Genetics for such program. The License and Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by Seattle Genetics or us for an uncured material breach by the other party upon 90 days’ notice, subject to extension for an additional 90 days if the material breach relates to diligence obligations and subject, in all cases, to dispute resolution procedures. The License and Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated due to the other party’s insolvency and may in certain instances, including for reasons of safety, be terminated on a product-by-product basis. Each party may also terminate the Agreements if the other party challenges the validity of any patents licensed under the Agreements, subject to certain exceptions. The Non-Exclusive Anticalin® Platform Technology License Agreement will 
28

terminate upon termination of the License and Collaboration Agreement, whether in its entirety or on a product-by-product basis.
Our License Agreements are older than our Strategic Partnerships and relate to non-strategic therapeutic areas, or do not provide us with co-development and co-commercialization rights. A brief summary of certain terms of selected License Agreements are provided below:
Our option agreement with Aska
On February 27, 2017, we entered into an Exclusive Option Agreement with Aska, granting Aska an exclusive option to license development and commercial rights to Pieris’ anemia drug, PRS-080, in Japan, South Korea and certain other Asian markets following completion of a multi-dose Phase IIa study to be conducted by Pieris in dialysis-dependent anemia patients.
Under the terms of the option agreement, we received an option payment of $2.75 million from Aska. Following an analysis period after the completion of the ongoing Phase IIa study conducted by us, Aska may exercise its option to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize PRS-080 in Japan, South Korea and certain other Asian markets (excluding China). Should Aska exercise the option, we would be eligible for more than $80 million in combined option exercise fee and milestones associated with development and commercialization of PRS-080 in the first indication in Japan. We may receive further development milestones in additional indications, as well as in other countries within the Aska territory. We may also receive double-digit royalties on net sales of PRS-080 up to the mid- to high-teens.
The term of the Exclusive Option Agreement, including the option rights granted therein, ends on the earlier of (i) Aska’s written notice to us of Aska’s decision not to exercise the option rights granted under the Exclusive Option Agreement, (ii) Aska’s failure to exercise its option rights within sixty (60) days after the final results of the Phase IIa study are made available to Aska, (iii) three (3) months from date on which we deliver to Aska the final results of the Phase IIa study in the European Union, or (iv) our and Aska’s execution of the definitive agreements granting Aska licenses to develop and commercialize PRS-080 in Japan, South Korea and certain other Asian countries (excluding China) as contemplated under the Exclusive Option Agreement.
Our collaboration with Roche
In December 2015, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Roche, in cancer immune therapy for the research, development, and commercialization of Anticalin-based drug candidates against a predefined, undisclosed target selected by Roche. The parties will jointly pursue a preclinical research program with respect to the identification and generation of Anticalin proteins and during an extendable research term, Roche will fund the work to be performed by us pursuant to the research plan. Following the research program, Roche will be responsible for subsequent pre-clinical and clinical development of any product and will have worldwide commercialization rights.
On February 28, 2018, pursuant to Pieris' license agreement with Roche, as amended, Roche provided notice to Pieris of its extension of the research term of the Research Collaboration and License Agreement to continue until August 31, 2018.
Our collaboration with Sanofi
In September 2010, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi, which was subsequently amended in February 2013. Under the terms of the agreement, we have agreed to use our proprietary Anticalin technologies to identify drug candidates against certain targets, with further development and commercialization activities conducted by Sanofi. The collaboration started with two targets under two separate collaboration projects and was extended by an additional multispecific Anticalin program in 2013. Sanofi has terminated two of the three programs (one program was terminated for internal strategic reasons and the other program was terminated following in vivo studies, as in vitro functionality did not fully translate into in vivo functionality for this first in class program), and we have the right to develop and commercialize drug candidates of the terminated programs on a royalty-free basis. The remaining active collaboration project was handed over to Sanofi for further development in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Our agreement with Allergan
In August 2009, we entered into an agreement with Allergan, under which we provided drug candidates for the treatment of ocular diseases, and Allergan is responsible for the further development and commercialization of products based on those candidates and bearing related costs. 
29

Our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo
Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited (“Daiichi Sankyo” or "Daiichi") partnered with Pieris to research, develop and commercialize two Anticalin therapeutics pursuant to a May 31, 2011 Collaboration Research and Technology Licensing Agreement (the “DS Collaboration Agreement”).
On May 8, 2017, Daiichi Sankyo discontinued the development of one of those two therapeutics, a PSCK9 program (DS-9001), after having advanced this program to first-in-human studies for strategic reasons. Consequentially, this Anticalin program, including respective intellectual property rights, were transferred back to Pieris.
The second of these two therapeutic programs pursued under the DS Collaboration Agreement is an Anticalin protein directed to calcitonin gene-related peptide (“CGRP”) for therapeutic use in the treatment of migraine headaches. The CGRP program is in the IND-enabling stage and Pieris previously reported Daiichi Sankyo’s decision to initiate a GLP toxicity study in connection with this program. 
Due to Daiichi Sankyo’s strategic prioritization and commercial reasons related to competing CGRP inhibitors in advanced stages of development, Daiichi Sankyo provided notice to Pieris on March 1, 2018 of its termination of the CGRP program. Pre-clinical data regarding this CGRP antagonizing Anticalin protein indicate that it has good drug-like properties, including strong target affinity, the ability to neutralize the biological activity of CGRP in vitro, and the ability to inhibit vasodilation, a cause of migraine pain, in rat skin following subcutaneous administration of the antagonist. In connection with the termination of the development of the CGRP program, and under the terms of the DS Collaboration Agreement, Daiichi Sankyo is obligated to carry out certain activities to facilitate transfer of activities, regulatory filings, materials, data, agreements and other matters to Pieris in connection with the return to Pieris of the development program related to the CGRP program. Pieris intends to diligently review the data associated with the program and consider its strategic options thereafter.
The foregoing summary of the terms relating to the DS Collaboration Agreement, including with respect to Daiichi Sankyo’s termination of such Agreement with respect to the CGRP program, is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the DS Collaboration Agreement, which were filed with the SEC as exhibit 10.7 to the Form 10-K filed on March 30, 2017. The contents of such exhibit are hereby incorporated by reference.
TUM License Agreement
On July 4, 2003, we entered into a Research and Licensing agreement with TUM, which was subsequently renewed and amended, on July 26, 2007. The agreement established a joint research effort led by Prof. Arne Skerra, Chair of Biological Chemistry of TUM, to optimize Anticalin technologies for use in therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic applications and as research reagents, and to gain fundamental insights in lipocalin scaffolds. We provided certain funding for TUM research efforts performed under the agreement. The research phase of this collaboration ended on February 28, 2013.
Under the terms of the agreement, TUM assigned to us certain materials and records resulting from the research. We retained rights to inventions made by our employees, and TUM assigned to us all inventions made under the agreement jointly by our employees and TUM personnel, provided that our employees made certain inventive contributions. With respect to all other inventions made in the course of the research, TUM granted to us worldwide exclusive license rights under patents and patent applications claiming such inventions. TUM retained rights to practice these inventions for research and teaching purposes.
As a result of research efforts to date under the agreement, we hold a worldwide exclusive license under our license agreement with TUM to multiple patents and patent applications. In the United States, we hold an exclusive license to an issued U.S. patent No. 8,598,317 for the composition of matter of mutein of human tear lipocalin binding to the extracellular region of the T cell co-receptor CD4 with detectable affinity, which patent will expire in 2027 (subject to a patent term adjustment period which is expected to be at least 742 days), as well as to its counterpart in the European Union. We also hold an exclusive license to an issued U.S. patent No. 8,420,051 directed to library of hNGAL scaffold of certain consensus sequence, which patent is expected to expire in 2029 (subject to a patent term adjustment period of 109 days), as well as to its counterparts in the European Union and in a number of foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, we hold an exclusive license to an issued U.S. patent No. 8,987,415 claiming isolated crystalline form of monomeric bacterial lipocalin. We bear the costs of filing, prosecution and maintenance of patents assigned or licensed to us under the agreement.
As consideration for the assignments and licenses, we are obliged to pay to TUM license payments on development of our proprietary products claimed by patents assigned or licensed to us by TUM. For each of such proprietary products developed by us, we could be required to pay up to an aggregate of approximately €0.2 million ($0.2 million) in license payments to TUM under the agreement.
30

We also are obliged to pay low single digit royalties, including annual minimum royalties, on sales of such products. Should we grant licenses or sublicenses to those patents to third parties, we are obliged to share a percentage of resulting revenue with TUM, which percentage of resulting revenue is creditable against our annual license payments to TUM. Our payment obligations are reduced by our proportionate contribution to a joint invention. Payment obligations terminate on expiration or annulment of the last patent covered by the agreement.
We can terminate the licenses to any or all licensed patents upon specified advance notice to TUM. TUM may terminate the license provisions of the agreement only for cause. Termination of the agreement does not terminate our rights in patents assigned to us.
Enumeral License Agreement
On April 18, 2016, we entered into a License Agreement with Enumeral Biomedical Holdings, Inc., or Enumeral, pursuant to which we acquired a non-exclusive (except in the exclusive field described below) worldwide license to use specified patent rights and know-how owned by Enumeral to research, develop and market fusion proteins consisting of PD-1 antibodies linked to one or more Anticalin proteins for use in the oncology area. Enumeral also agreed not to practice or assist third parties in practicing in the exclusive field, consisting of licensed antibodies fused to Anticalin proteins in the oncology area.
On June 6, 2016, we entered into a Definitive License Agreement to fully set forth the terms of Enumeral’s license of PD-1 antibodies and grant of options to license additional antibodies to us. Under the Definitive License and Transfer Agreement, we in-licensed intellectual property related to an Enumeral-generated antibody against PD-1 and an option to in-license up to two additional antibodies against undisclosed targets. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired a non-exclusive worldwide license under the applicable Enumeral patents and know-how to research, develop and commercialize fusion proteins incorporating Enumeral’s PD-1 antibody and one or more Anticalin proteins, or the Subsequent Options, which was an expansion of the scope of the original License Agreement.
The Subsequent Options expired on May 31, 2017. We are also obliged to pay to Enumeral development and sales milestones on development of products incorporating the Enumeral antibody, as well as low to lower-middle single-digit royalties as a percentage of net sales depending on the amount of net sales in the applicable years. In the event that we are required to pay a license fee or royalty to any third party related to the licensed products, our royalty payment obligations to Enumeral are reduced by the amount of such third-party fees or payments, up to 50% of the royalty payment for each calendar year due to Enumeral. Payment obligations terminate on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis on the later of ten years from the first commercial sale of a product incorporating the Enumeral antibody or the last to expire, lapse or be abandoned of a claim from the licensed Enumeral patents filed as of the effective date of the agreement that cover the manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or import of a product incorporating the Enumeral antibody.
The term of the Definitive License Agreement ends upon the expiration of the last to expire patent covered under the license. The Agreement may be terminated by us on 30 days’ notice and by Enumeral upon 60 days’ notice of a material breach by us (or 30 days with respect to a breach of payment obligations by us), provided that we have not cured such breach and dispute resolution procedures specified in the Definitive License Agreement have been followed.
On January 29, 2018, Enumeral filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts (the “Bankruptcy Court”). Enumeral continues to operate its business as a debtor in possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court.
The Bankruptcy Court has approved a process pursuant to which Enumeral will solicit higher or better offers for the PD-1 Assets and conduct an auction process to determine the ultimate purchaser.  The process contemplates that the winning bidder will purchase the PD-1 Assets, including the Definitive License Agreement, with the sale contemplated to close in early April 2018.  We will have an opportunity to vet the proposed purchaser to ensure that they (i) can continue to perform Enumeral’s obligations under the Definitive License Agreement, and (ii) will not interfere with our use of the rights we currently enjoy under the Definitive License Agreement. 
Kelun License Agreement
In connection with our efforts to develop multispecific Anticalin-based proteins designed to engage immunomodulatory targets, during the second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a License and Transfer Agreement with Sichuan Kelun-Biotech Biopharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (“Kelun”). Under that Agreement, Kelun has granted to the Company a non-exclusive worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) under certain intellectual property owned or controlled by Kelun to research, develop, 
31

manufacture, and commercialize bi- and multi- specific fusion proteins that include a monoclonal antibody developed by Kelun specific for an undisclosed target and one or more Anticalin proteins. We believe that the drug-like properties of the Anticalin drug class were demonstrated in various clinical trials with different Anticalin-based drug candidates, including PRS-080, PRS-060 and others.
Government Regulation
United States – FDA Process
The research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, among other things, of drug products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, or their issuance of warning
letters, or the imposition of fines, civil penalties, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices or other applicable regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;


• | submission to the FDA of an New Drug Application, NDA or Biologic License Application, or BLA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.

Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects for any clinical trial before it commences at that center, and the IRB must monitor the study until it is completed. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. There are also requirements governing the reporting of on-going clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:


• | Phase I: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-

32

threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.

• | Phase II: This phase involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.


• | Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.

The FDA or an IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. Including prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II, and before an NDA or BLA is submitted. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase II meeting to discuss their Phase II clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA, or an approved letter following satisfactory completion of all aspects of the review process. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency.
NDAs or BLAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. Priority review for an NDA for a new molecular entity and original BLAs will be six months from the date that the NDA or BLA is filed. In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on 
33

the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase IV testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, made permanent the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, which requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologicals, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension. These patent term extensions permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for any patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of fourteen years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the U.S. The FDASIA made permanent the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, which provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA, or a Written Request. If a Written Request does not include studies in neonates, the FDA is required to include its rationale for not requesting those studies. The FDA may request studies on approved or unapproved indications in separate Written Requests. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described studies.
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted in the U.S. and included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. The BPCIA amended the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, to create an abbreviated approval pathway for two types of “generic” biologics—biosimilars and interchangeable biologic products, and provides for a twelve-year exclusivity period for the first approved biological product, or reference product, against which a biosimilar or interchangeable application is evaluated; however if pediatric studies are performed and accepted by the FDA, the twelve-year exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product.
The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical studies to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency.
34

An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first approved. The first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed, but the exclusivity period may be shortened under certain circumstances.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.
The FDA also administers a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical trials to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices, and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions. A product does not have to be designated as an orphan drug to be eligible for the grant program. An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical study to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition. The study may address an unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market.
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
Under the fast track program and the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post- approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug’s BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are 
35

subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws and regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct.
Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the 28-member European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period.
When conducting clinical trials in the EU, we must adhere to the provisions of the EU Clinical Trials Directive and the laws and regulations of the EU Member States implementing them. These provisions require, among other things, that the prior authorization of an Ethics Committee and the submission and approval of a clinical trial authorization application be obtained in each Member State be obtained before commencing a clinical trial in that Member State.
As in the United States, it may be possible in foreign countries to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic product. As in the United States, a sponsor may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product.
Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third-party reimbursement. Third-party payors include government healthcare programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
36

In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to by significantly lower.
Description of the Acquisition
On December 17, 2014, Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pieris GmbH and the former stockholders of Pieris GmbH entered into an Acquisition Agreement, or the Acquisition Agreement. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the stockholders of Pieris GmbH contributed all of their equity interests in Pieris GmbH to Pieris in exchange for shares of Pieris common stock, which resulted in Pieris GmbH becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Pieris, which we refer to as the Acquisition. Prior to the Acquisition, as defined below, Pieris pursued a business of an errand concierge service online marketplace.
Prior to the closing of the Acquisition, on December 5, 2014, Pieris completed a 2.272727-for-1 forward split of its common stock in the form of a share dividend, with the result that 6,100,000 shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the stock split became 13,863,647 shares of common stock outstanding immediately thereafter. On December 16, 2014, Pieris amended and restated its Articles of Incorporation to, among other things, change its name from Marika Inc. to “Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,” and increase its authorized capital stock from 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.
On December 17, 2014, Pieris, Pieris GmbH and the former stockholders of Pieris GmbH entered into an Acquisition Agreement, or the Acquisition Agreement. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the stockholders of Pieris GmbH contributed all of their equity interests in Pieris GmbH to Pieris in exchange for shares of Pieris common stock, which resulted in Pieris GmbH becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Pieris, which we refer to as the Acquisition. The Acquisition closed on December 17, 2014.
In connection with the Acquisition and pursuant to a Split-Off Agreement, dated December 17, 2014 among Pieris, Marika Enterprises Inc. and Aleksandrs Sviks, or the Split-Off Agreement, and a general release agreement, Pieris transferred its pre-Acquisition assets and liabilities to its former majority stockholder, Aleksandrs Sviks, in exchange for the surrender by him and cancellation of 11,363,635 shares of Pieris common stock, or the Split-Off. Upon the closing of the Acquisition and the Split-Off, Pieris discontinued its pre-Acquisition business plans and is now pursuing only the business of Pieris GmbH.
Upon the closing of the Acquisition, Pieris ceased to be a “shell company” under applicable rules of the SEC. On December 17, 2014, in connection with the Acquisition, our Board of Directors changed our fiscal year from a fiscal year ending on June 30 to one ending on December 31 of each year, which was the fiscal year of Pieris GmbH.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, establishes a class of company called an “emerging growth company,” which generally is a company whose initial public offering was completed after December 8, 2011 and had total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year. Additionally, Section 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, establishes a class of company called a “smaller reporting company,” which generally is a company with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, if such public float is $0, had annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we qualify as both an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company.
As an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, we are eligible to take advantage of certain extended accounting standards and exemptions from various reporting requirements that are not available to public reporting companies that do not qualify for those classifications, including without limitation the following:

• | An emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.

This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will not be required to adopt new or revised accounting standards on the dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public reporting companies.

• | An emerging growth company is exempt from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and financial statements, commonly known as an “auditor discussion and analysis.”


• | An emerging growth company is not required to hold nonbinding advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation or any “golden parachute” payments not previously approved by stockholders.


• | Neither an emerging growth company nor a smaller reporting company is required to comply with the requirement of auditor attestation of internal controls over financial reporting, which is required for other public reporting companies by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.


• | A company that is either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company is eligible for reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic and annual reports, including without limitation exemption from the requirement to provide a compensation discussion and analysis describing compensation practices and procedures.


• | A company that is either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company is eligible for reduced financial statement disclosure in its registration statements, which must include two years of audited financial statements rather than the three years of audited financial statements that are required for other public reporting companies. Smaller reporting companies are also eligible to provide such reduced financial statement disclosure in annual reports on Form 10-K.

For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company and/or a smaller reporting company, we expect that we will take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations available to us as a result of those respective classifications. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2019, the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under applicable SEC rules. We expect that we will remain an emerging growth company for the foreseeable future, but cannot retain our emerging growth company status indefinitely and will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company on or before December 31, 2019. 
In accordance with Section 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are no longer a smaller reporting company as of December 31, 2017. However, under Item 10(f)(2)(i) of Regulation S-K, we are permitted to avail ourselves of the scaled disclosure requirements available to smaller reporting companies in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Having ceased to be a smaller reporting company, we will no longer be able to avail ourselves of scaled disclosure beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending March 31, 2018.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 68 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. In order to successfully develop our drug candidates, we must be able to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We anticipate hiring additional employees for research and development, clinical and regulatory affairs and general and administrative activities over the next few years. We also utilize the services of consultants, clinical research organizations, and other third parties on a regular basis.
