History
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 13, 2017 as Halo TopCo, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of IAC/InterActiveCorp (“IAC”), and changed our name to ANGI Homeservices Inc. on May 4, 2017. 
We are a holding company that was formed to facilitate the combination of IAC’s HomeAdvisor business (described below) and Angie’s List, Inc. (the “Combination”). 
Following the completion of the Combination on September 29, 2017, we: (i) own the HomeAdvisor business, which includes the Marketplace (formerly known as IAC’s HomeAdvisor domestic business and described below) and the various entities operating its international businesses, plus Angie’s List, Inc. (“Angie’s List”), mHelpDesk, CraftJack and Felix, and (ii) became a newly traded public company, with our Class A common stock commencing trading on The Global Select Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the ticker “ANGI” on October 2, 2017. For additional information regarding the Combination, see “Note 4-Business Combinations” to the consolidated and combined financial statements set forth in “Item 8-Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 
DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES
Marketplace
Overview
We own and operate the HomeAdvisor digital marketplace service in the United States (the “Marketplace”), which connects consumers with service professionals nationwide for home repair, maintenance and improvement projects. The Marketplace provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals, as well as instantly book appointments with those professionals online. The Marketplace also connects consumers with service professionals instantly by telephone, as well as offers several home services-related resources, such as cost guides for different types of home services projects. 
As of December 31, 2017, the Marketplace had a network of approximately 181,000 service professionals, each of whom had an active network membership and/or paid for consumer connections in December 2017. These service professionals provided services in more than 500 categories and 400 discrete markets in the United States, ranging from simple home repairs to larger home remodeling projects. The Marketplace generated approximately 18.1 million fully completed and submitted customer service requests during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Consumer Services
Consumers can submit a service request for a service professional through HomeAdvisor platforms (website and mobile application), as well as through certain paths on Angie’s List and various third party affiliate platforms. When a consumer submits a request for a service professional, we generally match that consumer (through our proprietary algorithms) with up to four service professionals from our network based on several factors, including the type of services desired, location and the number of service professionals available to fulfill the request. When a consumer submits a service request through Angie’s List, we generally connect that consumer (through our proprietary algorithms) with a combination of Marketplace service professionals and selected certified service professionals (described below) from the Angie’s List nationwide online directory (as and if available for the given service request). We provide all Marketplace services and tools to consumers free of charge.
Service professionals may contact consumers with whom they have been matched through the Marketplace directly and consumers can review profiles, ratings and reviews of presented service professionals and select the service professional whom they believe best meets their specific needs. In all cases, consumers are under no obligation to work with any service professional(s) referred by or found through the Marketplace (including any from the Angie’s List nationwide online directory).
In addition to (or in lieu of) submitting a service request through the Marketplace, consumers can also search for service professionals, as well as access service professional ratings and reviews and obtain quotes, on their own directly through the HomeAdvisor online directory. Consumers can rate and review service professionals with whom they have been connected through the Marketplace, as well as those listed in the HomeAdvisor online directory. 
We also provide several on-demand services, including Instant Booking and Instant Connect (patent-pending). Through our Instant Booking offering, consumers can schedule appointments for select home services with a Marketplace service professional instantly across HomeAdvisor platforms (website and mobile application). Through our Instant Connect offering, consumers can connect with a Marketplace service professional instantly by phone, as well as access the service through digital voice assistant platforms. In certain markets, we also provide Same Day Service and Next Day Service for certain home services.
In addition to matching and on-demand services, consumers can access the online HomeAdvisor True Cost Guide, which provides project cost information for more than 400 project types nationwide, as well as an online library of home services-related resources, which consists primarily of articles about home improvement, repair and maintenance, tools to assist consumers with the research, planning and management of their projects and general advice for working with service professionals. 
Service Professional Services
We primarily offer and sell Marketplace memberships and related products and services to service professionals through our sales force (described below). Our basic annual membership package includes membership in our network of service professionals, as well as access to consumer matches through the Marketplace and a listing in the HomeAdvisor online directory and certain other affiliate directories. Membership also includes a business profile page on HomeAdvisor.com, a mobile application and access to various online tools designed to help service professionals more effectively market to, and manage and connect with, consumers with whom they are matched. In addition to the membership subscription fee, Marketplace service professionals pay fees for consumer matches. 
We also offer certain other subscription products to Marketplace service professionals through mHelpDesk, a provider of cloud-based field service software for small to mid-size service professionals. Through mHelpDesk, we provide (among other products and services) mobile office management software that allows service professionals to complete several job-related tasks (such as scheduling, managing job flow, creating and distributing estimates and invoices and processing payments) real time while on the go. We also provide custom website development and hosting services.
Angie’s List
Overview
We also own and operate Angie’s List, which connects consumers with service professionals for local services through a nationwide online directory of service professionals in over 700 service categories. Angie’s List also provides consumers with valuable tools, services and content, including more than ten million verified reviews of local service professionals, to help them research, shop and hire for local services. We provide consumers with access to the Angie’s List nationwide online directory and related basic tools and services free of charge.

Consumer Services
When consumers visit Angie’s List, they can search for a service professional in the Angie’s List nationwide online directory and/or be connected with a service professional through the Marketplace. 
We provide consumers with access to ratings and reviews and the ability to search for service professionals through the Angie’s List nationwide online directory, as well as the Angie’s List digital magazine and access to certain promotions. Free registration is required in order to access the directory and related basic tools and services. For a fee, we offer two premium membership packages, which include varying degrees of online and phone support, access to exclusive promotions and features and the award-winning Angie’s List print magazine. Consumers who choose the Marketplace option will be matched with a combination of Marketplace service professionals and selected certified service professionals (described below) from the Angie’s List nationwide online directory (as and if available for the given service request). 
Consumers can rate service professionals listed in the Angie’s List nationwide online directory on an “A” to “F” grading scale based on a variety of criteria, including overall experience, availability, price, quality, responsiveness, punctuality and professionalism and other criteria, depending on the type of service provided. Ratings on each applicable criterion are weighted across all reviews submitted for the service professional to produce such professional’s grade on Angie’s List. Consumers can also provide a detailed description of (and commentary regarding) their service experience. Ratings and reviews cannot be submitted anonymously and there are processes in place to prevent service professionals from reporting on themselves or their competitors, as well as to detect fraudulent or otherwise problematic reviews. 
Service Professional Services
We provide service professionals with a variety of services and tools through Angie’s List. Generally, service professionals who do not have an overall member grade below a “B” are eligible for certification. Service professionals must satisfy certain criteria for certification, including retaining the requisite member grade, passing certain criminal background checks and attesting to proper licensure requirements.
Once eligibility criteria are satisfied, service professionals must purchase term-based advertising from us in order to obtain certification. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 45,000 certified service professionals under contract for advertising. If a certified service professional fails to meet any eligibility criteria during the term of his or her contract, refuses to participate in our complaint resolution process or engages in what we determine to be prohibited behavior through any of our service channels, we suspend any existing advertising and exclusive promotions and the related advertising contract is subject to termination. 
Certified service professionals rotate among the first service professionals listed in directory search results for an applicable category (together with their company name, overall rating, number of reviews, certification badge and basic profile information), with non-certified service professionals appearing below certified service professionals in directory search results. Certified service professionals can also provide exclusive promotions to members. When consumers choose the Marketplace option, our proprietary algorithms will determine where a given service professional appears within search results.
Our International Businesses
We also operate several international businesses that connect consumers with home service professionals. These international businesses include: (i) MyHammer, Travaux and Werkspot, the leading home services marketplaces in Germany, France and the Netherlands, respectively, (ii) MyBuilder, HomeStars and Instapro, leading home services marketplaces in the United Kingdom, Canada and Italy, respectively, and (iii) the Austrian operations of MyHammer. We own controlling interests in MyHammer, MyBuilder and HomeStars and wholly-own Travaux, Werkspot and Instapro. The business models of our international businesses vary by jurisdiction and differ in certain respects from the Marketplace business model.
Revenue
Our revenue is primarily derived from consumer connection revenue, which includes fees paid by Marketplace service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service), and membership subscription fees paid by Marketplace service professionals. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the service requested, type of match (such as Instant Booking, Instant Connect, Same Day Service or Next Day Service) and geographic location of service. Our consumer connection revenue is generated and recognized when a consumer match is delivered to a Marketplace service professional. Membership subscription revenue is generated through 
5

subscription sales to Marketplace service professionals and is deferred and recognized over the term (primarily one year) of the applicable membership.
Revenue is also derived from the sale of time-based advertising to certified service professionals listed in the Angie’s List nationwide directory and membership subscription fees from consumers for premium membership packages. Service professionals generally pay for advertisements in advance on a monthly or annual basis, at their option, with the average advertising contract term being approximately one year. Advertising contracts generally include an early termination penalty. Revenue from the sale of website, mobile and call center advertising is recognized ratably over the time period in which the advertisements run. Revenue from the sale of advertising in the Angie’s List Magazine is recognized in the period in which the publication containing the advertisement is published and distributed. Angie's List prepaid membership subscription fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the associated subscription, which is typically one year.
Marketing
We market our various products and services to consumers primarily through digital marketing (primarily paid search engine marketing, display advertising and third party affiliate agreements) and traditional offline marketing (national television and radio campaigns), as well as through email. Pursuant to third party affiliate agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote Marketplace products and services and those of Marketplace service professionals on their platforms. In exchange for these efforts, we generally pay these third parties a fixed fee when visitors from their platforms click through to one of our platforms and submit a valid service request through the Marketplace, or when visitors submit a valid service request on the affiliate platform and the affiliate transmits the service request to the Marketplace. We also market our products and services to consumers through partnerships with other contextually related websites and, to a lesser extent, through relationships with certain retailers and direct mail. 
We market subscription packages and related products and services to service professionals primarily through our Golden, Colorado based sales force, as well as through sales forces in Denver and Colorado Springs, Colorado, Lenexa, Kansas, New York, New York and Indianapolis, Indiana. We also market these products and services through search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations and manufacturers. We market term-based advertising and related products to service professionals primarily through our Indianapolis based sales force. 
We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in digital and traditional offline marketing (with continued expansion into new and existing digital platforms) to consumers and service professionals to promote our products and services and drive traffic to our various platforms and service professionals.
Technology
Each of our brands and businesses develops its own technology to support its products and services, leveraging both open-source and vendor supported software technology. Each of our various brands and businesses has dedicated engineering teams responsible for software development and creation of new features to support our products and services across a full range of devices (desktop, mobile web, native mobile applications and digital voice assistant platforms). Our engineering teams use an agile development process that allows us to deploy frequent iterative releases for product and service features. We incurred $47.9 million, $20.6 million and $16.8 million in product development costs in the fiscal years ending December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Competition
The home services industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and in many important respects, local in nature. We compete with, among others: (i) search engines and online directories, (ii) home and/or local services-related platforms, (iii) providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals and (iv) various forms of traditional offline advertising (primarily local in nature), including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline directories. We also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services. We believe our biggest competition comes from the traditional methods most people currently use to find service professionals, which is by word-of-mouth and through referrals. 
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:

• | the size, quality, diversity and stability of our network of Marketplace service professionals and the breadth of our online directory listings;

6


• | the functionality of our websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features and our products and services generally to consumers and service professionals, as well as our continued ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals generally;


• | our ability to continue to build and maintain awareness of, and trust in and loyalty to, our various brands, particularly our Angie’s List and HomeAdvisor brands;


• | our ability to consistently generate service requests through the Marketplace and contacts through our online directories that convert into revenue for our service professionals in a cost-effective manner; and


• | the quality and consistency of our service professional pre-screening processes and ongoing quality control efforts, as well as the reliability, depth and timeliness of customer ratings and reviews.

Intellectual Property 
We regard our intellectual property rights as critical to our success generally, with our trademarks, service marks and domain names being especially critical to the continued development and awareness of our brands and our marketing efforts. 
We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain name registrations, trade secrets and patent applications, as well as through contractual restrictions and reliance on federal, state and common law. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with employees, consultants, contractors and business partners, and employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment provisions. 
We have several registered trademarks in the United States (the most significant of which relate to our Angie’s List and HomeAdvisor brands), as well as other trademarks in Canada and Europe and several pending trademark applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions. We have also registered a variety of domestic and international domain names, the most significant of which relate to our HomeAdvisor and Angie’s List brands. In addition, we have one patent in the United States and four patent applications pending in the United States and certain other jurisdictions. We intend to pursue additional domain name registrations, trademark registrations and/or patent applications to the extent we believe doing so will be beneficial and cost-effective.
Government Regulation 
We are subject to laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet generally and through mobile applications, including laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for their operations and the activities of their users. As a result, we could be subject to actions based on negligence, various torts and trademark and copyright infringement, among other actions. 
In addition, because we receive, store and use a substantial amount of information received from or generated by consumers and service professionals, we are also impacted by laws and regulations governing privacy, the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal data and data breaches, primarily in the case of our European operations and the handling of personal data of consumers and service professionals located in the European Union. As a result, we could be subject to various private and governmental claims and actions, including under the General Data Protection Regulation, a comprehensive European Union privacy and data protection law that will become effective in May 2018 (the "GDPR"). The GDPR, which applies to companies that are organized in the European Union (or otherwise provide services to (or monitor) consumers who reside in the European Union), imposes strict standards regarding the sharing, storage, use, disclosure and protection of end user data and significant penalties (monetary and otherwise) for non-compliance. In addition, the European Union is considering an update to its Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive to impose stricter rules regarding the use of cookies in connection with the provision of digital products and services to consumers who reside in the European Union. Also, the potential exit from the European Union by the United Kingdom could result in the application of new and conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the United Kingdom and how we handle personal data of users located in the United Kingdom. Lastly, there are number of draft privacy laws and regulations under consideration in the United States (including in various states) and in certain other foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. 
7

We are also subject to laws governing marketing and advertising activities conducted by/through telephone, email, mobile devices and the Internet, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM Act and similar state laws. As a provider of products and services with a membership-based element, we are also subject to laws and regulations in certain states in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we do business that apply to membership payment models with auto-renewal provisions.

Intercompany Agreements 
In connection with the Combination, we and IAC entered into certain agreements to govern our relationship following the Combination. These agreements include the following:
Contribution Agreement
The contribution agreement sets forth the agreements between us and IAC regarding the principal transactions necessary for IAC to separate its HomeAdvisor business from its other businesses and to cause the HomeAdvisor business to be transferred to us prior to the Combination, as well as governs certain aspects of our relationship with IAC following the Combination. Under the contribution agreement: (i) we agreed to assume all of the assets and liabilities related to the 
8

HomeAdvisor business and indemnify IAC against any losses arising out of any breach by us of the contribution agreement or any other transaction related agreement described below and (ii) IAC agreed to indemnify us against losses arising out of any breach by IAC of the contribution agreement or any other transaction related agreement described below.
Investor Rights Agreement 
Under the investor rights agreement, IAC has certain registration, preemptive and governance rights related to us and the shares of our capital stock it holds. The investor rights agreement also provides certain governance rights for the benefit of stockholders other than IAC. 
Services Agreement 
The services agreement currently governs services that IAC has agreed to provide to us through September 29, 2018, with automatic renewal for successive one-year terms, subject to IAC’s continued ownership of a majority of the total combined voting power of our voting stock and any subsequent extension(s) or truncation(s) agreed to by us and IAC. Services currently provided to us by IAC pursuant this agreement include: (i) assistance with certain legal, M&A, human resources, finance, risk management, internal audit and treasury functions, health and welfare benefits, information security services and insurance and tax affairs, including assistance with certain public company and unclaimed property reporting obligations; (ii) accounting, controllership and payroll processing services; (iii) investor relations services and (iv) tax compliance services.

Under the tax sharing agreement, we are generally responsible and required to indemnify IAC for: (i) all taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of IAC or its subsidiaries that includes us or any of our subsidiaries (to the extent attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries, as determined under the tax sharing agreement) and (ii) all taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined, unitary or separate tax returns of us or our subsidiaries.

Under the employee matters agreement, our employees participate in IAC’s U.S. health and welfare plans, 401(k) plan and flexible benefits plan and we reimburse IAC for the costs of such participation. In the event IAC no longer retains shares representing at least 80% of the aggregate voting power of shares entitled to vote in the election of our board of directors, we will no longer participate in IAC’s employee benefit plans, but will establish our own employee benefit plans that will be substantially similar to the plans sponsored by IAC.
In addition, under the employee matters agreement, we are required to reimburse IAC for the cost of any IAC equity awards held by our current and former employees, with IAC electing to receive payment either in cash or shares of our Class B common stock. This agreement also provides that IAC may require stock appreciation rights granted prior the closing of the Combination and equity awards in our subsidiaries to be settled in either shares of our Class A common stock or IAC common stock. To the extent shares of IAC common stock are issued in settlement of these awards, we are obligated to reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing shares of our Class A common stock in the case of stock appreciation rights granted prior to the closing of the Combination and shares of our Class B common stock in the case of equity awards in our subsidiaries.
