Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are a science-led global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically-differentiated medicines that provide benefits to patients with rare disorders. We have launched two rare disease products and have a global commercial footprint. Our recent ability to commercialize products is the foundation that drives our continued investment in a robust pipeline of transformative medicines and our mission to provide access to best-in-class treatments for patients who have an unmet medical need.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to bring best in-class therapies with differentiated clinical benefit to patients affected by rare disorders, by leveraging our global commercial infrastructure to maximize value for our patients and stakeholders. 

• | Global DMD Franchise - We have two products, Translarna™ (ataluren) and Emflaza™ (deflazacort), for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, a rare, life threatening disorder. Translarna received marketing authorization from the European Commission in August 2014 for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or nmDMD, in ambulatory patients aged five years and older in the 31 member states of the European Economic Area, or EEA. During fiscal year 2017, Translarna achieved net sales of $145.2 million and is currently available for the treatment of nmDMD in over 25 countries. Emflaza is approved in the United States for the treatment of DMD in patients five years and older. During fiscal year 2017, Emflaza achieved net sales of $28.8 million. 


• | Internal Splicing Technology Platform - Our spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) collaboration is with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd and Hoffman-La Roche Inc., which we refer to collectively as Roche, and the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation, or SMA Foundation. Currently our collaboration has three clinical trials ongoing to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of RG7916 (RO7034067), the lead compound in the SMA program. Sunfish, a two-part clinical study in pediatric and adult type 2 and type 3 SMA patients initiated in the fourth quarter of 2016, followed by the initiation of Firefish in the fourth quarter of 2016, a two-part clinical study in infants with type 1 SMA. In October 2017, Sunfish transitioned into the pivotal second part of its study, which triggered a $20 million milestone payment to us from Roche. Preliminary data from the Sunfish trial were presented in January 2018 at the International Scientific Congress on Spinal Muscular Atrophy. RG7916 was well tolerated at all doses and there have been no drug-related safety findings leading to withdrawal. In Sunfish, the data demonstrate that the five cohorts treated with RG7916 for at least 28 days had an exposure-dependent increase in SMN protein. Early interim data from the Firefish trial were also presented in January 2018 at the International Scientific Congress on Spinal Muscular Atrophy and demonstrated maintenance of the ability to swallow and no need for tracheostomy or permanent ventilation. Overall survival were also presented. Previously published natural history data indicate that in comparable historic cohorts the median age of event-free survival for SMA Type 1 infants to be between 8 and 10.5 months.


• | Pursuing Value-Creation Opportunities - We have a pipeline of product candidates that are in early clinical and preclinical development, including our oncology program. Our preclinical and discovery programs are focused on the development of new treatments for multiple therapeutic areas, including neuromuscular disease and oncology. In April 2017, we acquired all rights to Emflaza from Marathon Pharmaceuticals, LLC (now known as Complete Pharma Holdings, LLC), or Marathon. As part of our business strategy, we may engage in further strategic transactions to expand and diversify our product pipeline, including through the acquisition of assets, businesses, or rights to products, product candidates or technologies or through strategic alliances or collaborations. 

Global DMD Franchise
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
Muscular dystrophies are genetic disorders involving progressive muscle wasting and weakness. DMD is the most common and one of the most severe types of muscular dystrophy. DMD occurs when a mutation in the dystrophin gene prevents the cell from making a functional dystrophin protein. Dystrophin is a muscle membrane associated protein and is critical to the structural and membrane stability of muscle fibers in skeletal, diaphragm and heart muscle. The absence of normally functioning dystrophin results in muscle fragility, such that muscle injury occurs when muscles contract or stretch during normal use. As muscle damage progresses, connective tissue and fat replace muscle fibers, resulting in inexorable muscle weakness.
4

Because the dystrophin gene is located on the X chromosome, DMD occurs primarily in young boys, although approximately 10% of female carriers show some disease symptoms. DMD is rare, and estimates of occurrence include approximately 1 in every 3,500 live male births, according to Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy and approximately 1 in every 5,000 live male births according to Moat, et al. (2013) in the European Journal of Human Genetics. We estimate that there are approximately 10,000 DMD patients in the United States aged five years or older. Several different types of mutation in the dystrophin gene can result in DMD, including deletion, duplication and nonsense mutations. A test known as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) can detect large deletions and duplications, which account for approximately 75% of all mutations. However, gene sequencing is required to identify small mutations such as nonsense mutations. We estimate that nonsense mutations account for approximately 13% of cases of DMD. Without treatment, patients with DMD typically lose walking ability by their early teens, require ventilation support in their late teens, and eventually experience premature death due to heart and lung failure. Even with medical care, most people with DMD die from cardiac or respiratory failure before or during their 30s.
Marketing authorization matters 
Translarna for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy
European Economic Area
We received marketing authorization from the European Commission in August 2014 for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five years and older in the 31 member states of the EEA. The marketing authorization is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of continued authorization, which we refer to as the annual EMA reassessment, as well as our satisfaction of any specific obligation or other requirement placed upon the marketing authorization, including Study 041, a three-year clinical trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of Translarna in the approved patient population.
In January 2016, we submitted the final clinical study report from our Phase 3 clinical trial in nmDMD (referred to as ACT DMD) to the EMA in fulfillment of the initial specific obligation placed on our marketing authorization. The primary efficacy endpoint of ACT DMD was not achieved with statistical significance. We made our submission to the EMA as a type II variation request that sought to have this initial specific obligation to our marketing authorization removed and a full marketing authorization granted. In February 2016, we also submitted a marketing authorization renewal request with the EMA.
In January 2017, the European Commission renewed our marketing authorization based on the totality of the clinical data available from our trials and studies of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, including the safety and efficacy results of our Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trials, and our commitment to conduct and submit the results of Study 041 to the EMA by the end of the third quarter of 2021. The trial is comprised of two stages: an 18-month randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial followed by an 18-month open label extension period. See “Item 1. Business-Planned and ongoing clinical development of Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy-Study 041” for further information regarding the specific obligation to the marketing authorization in the EEA. The authorization remains subject to the annual EMA reassessment, as the EMA did not grant our request for full marketing authorization. In June 2017, the European Commission renewed our marketing authorization, making it effective, unless extended, through August 5, 2018. In February 2018, we submitted a marketing authorization renewal request to the EMA.
Marketing authorization is required in order for us to engage in any commercialization of Translarna in the EEA, including through participation in the market access process and related pricing and reimbursement negotiations, on a country-by-country basis with each country in the EEA, and is also required to make Translarna available under early access programs, or EAP programs. There is substantial risk that if we are unable to renew our EEA marketing authorization during any annual renewal cycle, if our product label is materially restricted, or if Study 041 does not provide the data necessary to maintain our marketing authorization, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna in the EEA and other territories.
See “Item 1. Business-Commercial Matters-Market Access Considerations” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and our Product Candidates” and “-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates” for further information regarding the marketing authorization in the EEA, the market access process and related risks.
As the marketing authorization holder, we are obligated to monitor the use of Translarna for nmDMD to detect, assess and take required action with respect to information that could impact the safety profile of Translarna and to report this information, through pharmacovigilance submissions, to the EMA. Following its assessment of these submissions, the EMA can recommend to the European Commission actions ranging from the continued maintenance of the marketing authorization to its withdrawal.
United States

We submitted our completed NDA to the FDA in December 2015 with our ACT DMD analyses, after commencing our submission on a rolling basis in December 2014. On February 22, 2016, we received a Refuse to File letter from the FDA stating that our NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review in particular because, in the view of the FDA, both the Phase 2b and Phase 3 ACT DMD trials were negative and do not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness and that our NDA does not contain adequate information regarding the abuse potential of Translarna. Additionally, the FDA stated that we had proposed a post-hoc adjustment of ACT DMD that eliminates data from a majority of enrolled patients. While other comments and requests were noted in the letter as items to be addressed if the NDA were to be resubmitted, the FDA specified that they were not related to its refusal to file our NDA.
Following the refusal to file of our NDA, we initiated dialogue with the FDA to discuss and clarify the matters set forth in the letter and determine our best path forward. In accordance with the formal dispute resolution process that exists within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research of the FDA, we filed a formal appeal of the Refuse to File letter, which was denied in October 2016. In the first quarter of 2017, we filed our Translarna NDA for nmDMD via the FDA’s file over protest regulations. We included additional retrospective and post hoc analyses from our clinical trials with the NDA filed in 2017, including analyses of the 6-minute walk test using alternative statistical and analytical methods and new analyses from the North Star Ambulatory Assessment test, a functional scale designed for boys affected by DMD. Filing over protest is a procedural path permitted by FDA regulations that allows a company to have its NDA filed and reviewed when there is a disagreement with regulators over the acceptability of the NDA submission.
In October 2017, the Office of Drug Evaluation I of the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for the NDA, stating that it was unable to approve the application in its current form. In response, we filed a formal dispute resolution request with the Office of New Drugs of the FDA. In February 2018, the Office of New Drugs of the FDA denied our appeal of the Complete Response Letter. In its response, the Office of New Drugs recommended a possible path forward for our ataluren NDA submission based on the accelerated approval pathway. This would involve a re-submission of an NDA containing the current data on effectiveness of ataluren with new data to be generated on dystrophin production in nmDMD patients’ muscles. We intend to follow the FDA’s recommendation and will collect such dystrophin data using newer technologies via procedures and methods that will be mutually agreeable to us and the FDA. Additionally, should a re-submission of an NDA receive accelerated approval, the Office of New Drugs stated that Study 041, which is currently enrolling, could serve as the confirmatory post-approval trial required in connection with the accelerated approval pathway.
There is substantial risk that we will not be able to agree with the FDA on the procedures or methods to be used to collect dystrophin data or that any such studies will not provide the necessary data to support a marketing approval for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD.
In 2010, we filed a NDA for ataluren based on our Phase2b clinical data, which the FDA refused to file. We filed a formal dispute resolution request concerning this decision in 2011 and, in 2012, the FDA reaffirmed its previous decision to refuse to file the 2010 NDA. In its 2016 Refuse to File letter and in its 2017 Complete Response Letter and its denial of our appeal to the Complete Response Letter, the FDA referenced its prior refusal to file relative to the Phase 2b data and our early discussions with the FDA, reiterating the views previously expressed.
See “Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-The new drug approval, or NDA, process” below for further discussion with respect to the NDA process. See “Item 1. Business-Translarna™ (ataluren)” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and our Product Candidates” and “-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates” for further detail regarding the results of our completed trials and studies of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, our regulatory strategy in the United States, and the related risks to our business.
Other Territories
Translarna received marketing authorization for the treatment of nmDMD in Israel and South Korea in 2015 and these licenses are currently active. Many territories outside of the EEA, including Israel and South Korea, reference and depend on the determinations by the EMA when considering the grant of a marketing authorization. It is unlikely that we would be able to maintain our marketing authorizations in these regions in the event the EMA determines not to renew or otherwise modifies or withdraws our marketing authorization in the EEA. We have been pursuing and expect to continue to pursue marketing authorizations for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in other regions. 
Emflaza for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the United States
Emflaza, both in tablet and suspension form, received approval from the FDA in February 2017 as a treatment for DMD in patients five years of age and older in the United States. We estimate that there are approximately 10,000 DMD patients in the United States aged five years or older. We are obligated to complete certain post-marketing requirements in connection with the FDA's approval, including pre-clinical and clinical safety studies.
6

We expect that Emflaza will have a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for the approved indication, commencing on the date of FDA approval, under the provisions of the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, or the Orphan Drug Act, as well as a concurrent five-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for the active ingredient in Emflaza under the provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act. Additionally, because the FDA has requested that we conduct a pediatric study of Emflaza, we expect to be granted a term of pediatric exclusivity upon completion of an agreed-upon study. This additional exclusivity provides six months of marketing protection to the end of the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the seven-year orphan exclusivity period. See “Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-The new drug approval process-Hatch-Waxman exclusivity” “Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-Pediatric exclusivity” below for further discussion with respect to marketing protection we rely on.
Product development programs
Based on its understood mechanism of action, we believe that Translarna may have benefit in the treatment of patients with genetic disorders that arise as a result of a nonsense mutation. We are pursuing studies for Translarna in additional indications including nonsense mutation aniridia and nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to Translarna for all indications in all territories. The EMA has designated Translarna as an orphan medicinal product and the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to Translarna for the treatment of DMD and aniridia. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to RG7916 for the treatment of patients with SMA.
The following table summarizes key information about our most advanced product development programs that are being developed by us, or in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies or independent investigators. All of the compounds in these programs are new chemical entities that we identified using our proprietary technologies.

_______________________________________________________________________________

(1) | The marketing authorization in the EEA includes the specific obligation to conduct and submit the results of Study 041 to the EMA by the end of the third quarter of 2021 and requires annual renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk profile of the authorization.


(2) | In its denial of our appeal of the Complete Response Letter, the Office of New Drugs recommended a possible path forward for the ataluren NDA submission based on the accelerated approval pathway. This would involve a re-submission of an NDA containing the current data on effectiveness of ataluren with new data to be generated on dystrophin production in nmDMD patients’ muscles. We intend to follow the FDA’s recommendation and will collect such dystrophin data using newer technologies via procedures and methods that will be mutually agreeable to us and the FDA. Additionally, the Office of New Drugs stated that Study 041, which is currently enrolling, could serve as the confirmatory post-approval trial required in connection with the accelerated approval framework.


(3) | PTC596 was generally well tolerated as a monotherapy, producing systemic concentrations in patients similar to or exceeding those associated with preclinical activity. Though a protocol-defined maximum tolerated dose was not reached, the dose of 10 mg/kg was deemed intolerable likely due to pill burden and certain excipients that may have contributed to Grade 2 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in two of three patients.

Translarna™ (ataluren)
Mechanism of action
We discovered Translarna by applying our technologies to identify molecules that promote or enhance the suppression of nonsense mutations. Nonsense mutations are implicated in a variety of genetic disorders. Nonsense mutations create a premature stop signal in the translation of the genetic code contained in messenger RNA, or mRNA, and prevent the production of full-length, functional proteins. Based on our research, we believe that Translarna interacts with the ribosome, which is the component of the cell that decodes the mRNA molecule and manufactures proteins, to enable the ribosome to read through premature nonsense stop signals on mRNA and allow the cell to produce a full-length, functional protein. As a result, we believe that Translarna has the potential to be an important therapy for genetic disorders which are the result of a nonsense mutation. Genetic tests are available for many genetic disorders, including those noted above, to determine if the underlying cause is a nonsense mutation. Translarna has been generally well tolerated in all of our clinical trials to date, which have enrolled over 1,000 individuals to date.
Planned and ongoing clinical development of Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Phase 2 pediatric study
As part of our pediatric development commitments under our marketing authorization in the EEA and to support the potential expansion of the Translarna label to younger patients with nmDMD, we initiated a Phase 2 pediatric clinical study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of Translarna in patients two to five years of age. The study, initiated in June 2016, includes a four-week screening period, a four-week study period, and a 48-week extension period for patients who complete the four-week study period (52 weeks total treatment). We have submitted to the EMA a label-extension request to our marketing authorization in the EEA to include patients from two to up to five years of age, which includes data from this study. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully obtain such a label extension
Study 041
Overview. As a specific obligation to our marketing authorization in the EEA, we are required to conduct and submit to the EMA the results of a three-year clinical trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of Translarna in the treatment of ambulatory patients with nmDMD aged five years or older. The trial is comprised of two stages: an 18-month randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial followed by an 18-month open label extension period. We refer to the 18-month clinical trial portion as “Stage 1” and the 18-month extension period as “Stage 2”. We refer to Stage 1 and Stage 2 together as Study 041. As a condition to our marketing authorization, we are required to submit the results of Study 041 to the EMA by September 2021. The protocol for Study 041 has been approved by the CHMP.
For a discussion of the risks related to conducting clinical trials, in general, and Study 041, in particular, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and our Product Candidates” ands “-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates”.
Enrollment. According to the study protocol, Study 041 will enroll nmDMD patients aged five years and above who achieve a 6-minute walk distance, or 6MWD, equal to or greater than 150 meters at three pre-treatment evaluation times (screening, baseline day one and baseline day two), tested as set forth in the protocol. Qualified participants will also need to perform timed function tests of running/walking 10 meters, climbing/descending four stairs and standing from supine within 30 seconds at both screening and baseline and meet the other criteria set forth in the protocol.
Of the approximately 250 patients planned to be enrolled in Study 041, approximately 160 patients are expected to meet the criteria for inclusion in the primary analysis population, which we refer to as the modified intention-to-treat population, or mITT. Patients included in the mITT must be at least 7, but less than 16, years old, with a 6MWD of equal to or greater than 300 meters and a stand from supine time of five seconds or more, each as tested at screening and baseline.
Objectives and endpoints. The primary objective of Study 041 is to evaluate the effect of Translarna on ambulation and endurance as assessed by the 6-minute walk test, or 6MWT. Based on the study protocol, the primary analysis of Stage 1 will evaluate the difference in slope of change in 6MWD from baseline to week 72 between Translarna and placebo in the mITT population. Data from participants who do not qualify for inclusion in the mITT will be used for summary and analysis of efficacy endpoints.
Slope of change in 6MWD over 144 weeks will also be assessed as a secondary endpoint at the conclusion of Stage 2, and the consistency of the results at 144 weeks against week 72 will be assessed. Changes in 6MWD from baseline to week 72 and week 144 respectively will also be assessed as secondary endpoints.
8

A secondary objective of Study 041 is to determine the effects of Translarna on ambulation and burst activity as assessed by timed function tests (10-meter run/walk, 4-stair stair-climb, and 4-stair stair descend). Each timed function test will be analyzed as a secondary endpoint for both the mITT and ITT populations, at the end of Stage 1 and Stage 2. A separate analysis will evaluate 10-meter run/walk results in participants with a baseline 6MWD below 300 meters. An additional analysis will evaluate a composite endpoint of average change in times to run/walk 10 meters, climb 4 stairs, and descend 4 stairs. We will also assess each of time to loss of ambulation, stair-climbing and stair-descending over 72 weeks and over 144 weeks.
Determination of the effects of Translarna on lower-limb muscle function as assessed by the North Star Ambulatory Assessment, or NSAA, a functional scale designed for boys affected by DMD, will serve as an additional secondary objective. NSAA scores will be analyzed as secondary endpoints for both the mITT and ITT populations, at the end of Stage 1 and Stage 2. A separate analysis for Stage 2 will evaluate changes in total score in participants with a baseline 6MWD of equal to or greater than 400 meters and under 7 years of age. We will also assess the risk of loss of NSAA items over 72 weeks and 144 weeks.
The safety profile of Translarna also will be evaluated throughout Stage 1 and Stage 2 as a secondary objective.
Certain exploratory endpoints will also be assessed in Study 041. In patients aged 7 years and above, change from baseline in upper limb function will be assessed using both functional testing and parent/caregiver-reported questionnaires. In patients under 7 years of age, muscle strength will be assessed by change from baseline in myometry parameters. At pre-qualified sites only, magnetic resonance imaging will be used to assess change from baseline in muscle fat fraction. The effects of Translarna on pulmonary function will be assessed by change from baseline in forced vital capacity. In addition, subject- and parent/caregiver-reported questionnaires and at-home diaries will assessed to evaluate the effect of Translarna on health-related quality of life (HRQL) changes from baseline.
Stratification. In Stage 1, participants will be randomized 1:1 to placebo or Translarna (10, 10, 20 mg/kg). The randomization will be stratified based on type of concomitant corticosteroid used at baseline (deflazacort versus prednisone/prednisolone), maximum of the two valid 6-minute walk tests performed at baseline day 1 and day 2 (<300 meters versus ≥300 to <350 meters, versus ≥350 to <400 meters, versus ≥400 meters), and time to stand from supine at baseline (<5 seconds versus ≥5 seconds).
Observational study, data collection, and open label, extension trials of Translarna for treatment of nmDMD
We are undertaking a multi-center, observational post-approval study of patients receiving Translarna on a commercial basis, as required by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee of the EMA and in collaboration with TREAT-NMD and the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group. During the study we will gather data on the safety, effectiveness, and prescription patterns of Translarna in routine clinical practice.
Pursuant to the five-year managed access agreement entered into in July 2016 between us, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, National Health Services England, or NHS England, and other interested parties, the NorthStar Network is collecting data on the efficacy of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD as measured by the NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment test. Patients receiving Translarna will be compared to an historical natural history population as well as a matched control group in order to assess response to treatment over the period specified in the managed access agreement.
An open label, extension trial involving patients who participated in ACT DMD is also ongoing, across multiple sites in the United States, Europe and other territories. Two open label extension trials involving patients from the United States, Europe, Israel, Australia, and Canada who had participated in our prior trials for nmDMD are also ongoing. In certain limited territories where Translarna is available via a commercial or EAP program, we have begun to wind down the studies and are investigating the potential impact that additional site closures may have on our research and development expense.
Completed clinical trials of Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy
Phase 3 clinical trial of Translarna for nmDMD (ACT DMD)
In October 2015, we announced results from ACT DMD, also referred to as Study 020, our Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Translarna in patients with nmDMD. ACT DMD involved 228 patients at 53 sites across 18 countries.
In the overall intent-to-treat, or ITT, study population, the primary endpoint of change from baseline at week 48 in the 6MWT, showed a 15 meter benefit in favor of Translarna, which did not meet statistical significance.
A summary of the safety and efficacy results from ACT DMD is outlined below.
9

Safety and tolerability.    The results of ACT DMD confirmed the favorable safety profile of Translarna seen in our 48-week, 174-patient Phase 2b double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of Translarna in patients with nmDMD completed in 2009, or the Phase 2b trial.
Translarna was generally well tolerated in ACT DMD. There were two study discontinuations due to adverse events, including one in the Translarna arm (constipation) and one in the placebo arm (disease progression). Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most common adverse events in this trial were vomiting (20.4% overall), nasopharyngitis (20.0%), headache (18.3%), and fall (17.8%). These events were generally balanced across treatment arms and are typical of pediatric illnesses and/or patients with DMD. Adverse events with at least a 10% incidence in either treatment arm that were seen with increased frequency from the placebo group to the Translarna 40 mg dose group were vomiting (18.3% for placebo, 23.6% for the Translarna 40 mg group), nasopharyngitis (19.1% for placebo, 20.9% for the Translarna 40 mg group), fall (17.4% for placebo, 18.3% for the Translarna 40 mg group), cough (11.3% for placebo, 16.5% for the Translarna 40 mg group) diarrhea (8.7% for placebo, 17.4% for the Translarna 40 mg group), and pyrexia (10.4% for placebo, 13.9% for the Translarna 40 mg group). An overview of adverse events in this trial is shown in the table below.

Deaths | — | | — | | — 

There were no serious adverse events observed during the trial that were considered possibly or probably related to Translarna. Determination of relatedness of the serious adverse event to Translarna was made by the trial investigator, based on his or her judgment.
Intent to Treat (ITT) Population.    The primary efficacy endpoint in ACT DMD was change in 6MWD from baseline to week 48. In the ITT population, a 15 meter benefit (p=0.213) was observed in the primary endpoint which did not meet statistical significance.
Secondary endpoints in the trial included the proportion of patients with at least 10% worsening in 6MWD at week 48 of the trial compared to baseline, or 10% 6MWD worsening, and change in timed function tests of time to run/walk 10 meters, climb four stairs and descend four stairs. The hazard ratio for Translarna versus placebo was 0.75 (p=0.160) for 10% 6MWD worsening. Benefits trended in favor of Translarna over placebo in the timed function tests in the ITT population, including observed results in time to run/walk 10 meters (1.2 seconds; p=0.117), time to climb four stairs (1.8 seconds; p=0.058), and time to descend four stairs (1.8 seconds; p=0.012).
Additional endpoints included the NSAA test and the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument, or PODCI, a validated tool for measuring quality of life in pediatric patients with orthopedic conditions. These additional endpoints favored Translarna in the ITT population but did not meet statistical significance.
Pre-Specified Analyses.    The statistical analysis plan submitted to the FDA for ACT DMD set forth pre-specified analyses of efficacy to be conducted, including subgroups of patients with baseline 6MWD less than 350 meters and patients with baseline 6MWD of greater than or equal to 300 and less than 400 meters, which we refer to as our key subgroups.
10

The pre-specification of our key subgroups was scientifically justified based upon knowledge of the biology and natural history of the disease and the evolving understanding of the of the six minute walk test as used to assess DMD patients. We considered the pre-specified less than 350 meter baseline 6MWD population as a key subgroup based on the knowledge that 350 meters represents a transition point for patients towards a more rapid decline in walking ability as supported by analysis from our Phase 2b trial. Furthermore, we considered the pre-specified 300 to 400 meter baseline 6MWD population as a key subgroup based on an increasing understanding of the sensitivity limitations of the six minute walk test as an endpoint in 48-week studies. Natural history data suggest that the 6MWT may not be the optimal tool to demonstrate efficacy in patients with either a baseline 6MWD of less than 300 meters, as these patients have significant muscle loss as monitored by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and are at high risk for losing ambulation regardless of treatment, or in high walking patients, such as those with a baseline 6MWD at or greater than 400 meters, as these patients are likely to remain stable over a 48 week testing period.
By defining these key subgroups, we thereby also defined corresponding subgroups of patients with baseline 6MWD greater than or equal to 350 meters, greater than or equal to 400 meters, and less than 300 meters. We also pre-specified a meta-analysis of the combined results from ACT DMD and the Phase 2b ambulatory decline phase patients.
Pre-specified sub-group analysis.    We saw strong evidence of clinical benefit in the pre-specified subgroup of patients with baseline 6MWD between 300 and 400 meters. Specifically, we observed a benefit in Translarna-treated patients of 47 meters (nominal p=0.007) in the 6MWT in this subgroup. This was consistent with an observed benefit of 49 meters (nominal p=0.026) in our Phase 2b clinical trial in the 300 to 400 meters baseline 6MWD population. We also saw clinically meaningful benefit for Translarna over placebo in each of the timed function tests, including observed results in time to run/walk 10 meters (2.1 seconds; nominal p=0.066), time to climb four stairs (3.6 seconds; nominal p=0.003), and time to descend four stairs (4.3 seconds; nominal p<0.001). The hazard ratio for Translarna versus placebo was 0.79 (nominal p=0.418) for 10% 6MWD worsening. In addition, a benefit of 4.5 points over placebo (nominal p=0.041) was observed in the NSAA test, which we believe is clinically meaningful. We believe that the benefits observed in this key pre-specified subgroup support the use of the 6MWT in the patients with a walking ability in the 300 to 400 meters range and the understanding that the reliability of the 6MWT over a 48 week period was limited at both the lower and upper ends of our 6MWD enrollment range.
In the pre-specified subgroup of patients with baseline 6MWD less than 350 meters, we observed a benefit of 24 meters (nominal p=0.210) in favor of Translarna in the 6MWT. An analysis of the results from our Phase 2b clinical trial in the less than 350 meters baseline 6MWD population, defined post-hoc, demonstrated a 68 meter benefit in the 6MWT (nominal p=0.006). In the timed function tests for the subgroup of ACT DMD patients with baseline 6MWD less than 350 meters, we observed benefits for Translarna over placebo in time to run/walk 10 meters (2.3 seconds; nominal p=0.033), time to climb four stairs (4.2 seconds; nominal p=0.019) and time to descend four stairs (4.0 seconds; nominal p=0.007).
As described above, we believe the 6MWT lacks sensitivity to detect a clinical effect in patients with baseline less than 300 meters in a 48-week trial. However, the timed function tests trended in favor of patients treated with Translarna with a baseline 6MWD below 300 meters, including observed benefit over placebo in time to run/walk 10 meters (2.5 seconds; nominal p=0.066), time to climb four stairs (2.4 seconds; nominal p=0.790), and time to descend four stairs (2.1 seconds; nominal p=0.595). We believe the positive trends in this population reflect that short muscle burst activity tests may be a better clinical measure for patients that are at a more advanced stage of disease progression. Consistent with the natural history of ambulatory DMD patients with 6MWD greater than 400 meters, which indicates stability in walking ability over a 48 week period, we observed no meaningful difference in 6MWT between patient groups. Similarly, we observed no meaningful difference in 6MWT between patient groups with baseline 6MWD greater than 350 meters.
Pre-specified meta-analysis.    The meta-analysis combined efficacy results from the ACT DMD ITT population and Phase 2b ambulatory decline phase subgroup. The Phase 2b ambulatory decline phase group includes the patients from our randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with nmDMD who would have met the enrollment criteria of ACT DMD.
Results from the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant 21 meter improvement in 6MWD (p = 0.015) favoring Translarna.
Additionally, the meta-analysis showed statistically significant benefit for Translarna over placebo across each timed function test including time to run/walk 10 meters (1.4 seconds; p=0.025), time to climb four stairs (1.6 seconds; p =0.018) and time to descend four stairs (2.0 seconds; p=0.004). The hazard ratio for Translarna versus placebo was 0.66 (p=0.023) for 10% 6MWD worsening. We believe that we are able to demonstrate a statistically significant efficacy outcome in the 6MWD in the meta-analysis, despite the significant variability in baseline 6MWD among patients in both ACT DMD and the Phase 2b ambulatory decline phase, due to the substantially larger patient population available in the pooled analysis.
Retrospective Analysis.    We also looked back at the observed results in the meta-analysis for all patients with a baseline 300 to 400 meter 6MWD from ACT DMD and the Phase 2b trial. The meta-analysis of these data demonstrated a 45 meter benefit 
11

(nominal p<0.001) in the 6MWT as well as clinically meaningful benefits across each secondary endpoint timed function test, including benefit over placebo in time to run/walk 10 meters (2.2 seconds; nominal p=0.008), time to climb four stairs (3.4 seconds; nominal p<0.001) and time to descend four stairs (4.3 seconds; nominal p<0.001). This meta-analysis of patients with baseline 6MWD of 300 to 400 meters was not pre-specified and is defined post-hoc.
Statistical Considerations.    The pre-specified meta-analysis results, which favored Translarna in the 6MWT and each of the timed function tests, are considered statistically significant. In the pre-specified subgroups of ACT DMD patients with a baseline 6MWD less than 350 meters and 300 to 400 meters, the p-values for the 6MWT and each of the timed function tests are considered nominal. For information with respect to the use of nominal p-values and post-hoc analyses, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Our conclusions regarding the activity and potential efficacy of Translarna in nmDMD are primarily based on retrospective, subgroup and meta-analyses of the results of our Phase 2b and ACT DMD clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Other than with respect to certain of our meta-analyses, results of our analyses are expressed as nominal p-values, which are generally considered less reliable indicators of efficacy than adjusted p-values. In addition, retrospective analyses are generally considered less reliable than pre-specified analyses.”
Participation Criteria and Stratification.    Certain key inclusion criteria were specified in the ACT DMD trial protocol for enrollment: the patient had to be 7 through 16 years of age; at the screening visit the patient had to be able to walk no more than 80% of predicted 6MWD compared to healthy boys matched for age and height, but had to be able to walk at least 150 meters during the 6MWT; and the patient must have used systemic corticosteroids for a minimum of six months prior to start of treatment. The ACT DMD trial protocol provided for the exclusion of patients from the trial if, among other things, they recently used systemic aminoglycoside antibiotics, recently initiated or changed corticosteroid therapy or previously received Translarna treatment. Patients enrolled in ACT DMD underwent 48 weeks of blinded treatment prior to the final analysis and the randomization was stratified based on age (<9 years versus ≥9), baseline 6MWD (<350 versus ≥350 meters), and duration of prior use of corticosteroids (<12 months versus ≥12 months).
Phase 2b clinical trial of Translarna for nmDMD
Overview.    In March 2010, we announced the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, dose ranging Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the long term efficacy and safety of Translarna in patients with nmDMD as confirmed by gene sequencing. We conducted this clinical trial in 174 patients in 11 countries. The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of Translarna on ambulation using 6MWD at week 48 of the trial compared to baseline as the primary efficacy endpoint. Supportive analyses of ambulation consisted of the proportion of patients with at least 10% worsening in 6MWD at week 48 of the trial compared to baseline and time to persistent 6MWD 10% worsening from baseline. Multiple additional secondary and exploratory endpoints, including, among others, tests of muscle function based on time to climb four stairs, descend four stairs, run/walk 10 meters and stand from supine, were monitored for the primary purpose of gaining a greater understanding of clinical trial design in DMD. We assessed safety through collection of adverse event information, measurement of laboratory parameters and performance of electrocardiograms, or ECGs. We also evaluated study drug compliance and Translarna plasma concentrations.
Patients enrolled in this trial were at least five years of age, had the ability at baseline to walk at least 75 meters unassisted during a 6MWT, had onset of disease signs/symptoms prior to age nine, had elevated creatine kinase levels, and had ongoing difficulty with walking. Patients were excluded from the trial if they had a prior or ongoing clinically significant illness, had a positive hepatitis B or hepatitis C test or had recently used systemic aminoglycosides. Patients receiving corticosteroid therapy were required to have initiated therapy more than six months prior to enrollment and to be on a stable dosing regimen for at least three months prior to entering the trial. The trial protocol specified a clinic visit every six weeks to assess efficacy and safety and an interim laboratory visit every three weeks for the first 24 weeks of the trial. The treatment duration was 48 weeks.
Patients were stratified based on age, baseline 6MWD, and use of corticosteroids. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive (i) placebo; (ii) daily dose of 40 mg/kg of Translarna, or the 40 mg group; and (iii) daily dose of 80 mg/kg of Translarna, or the 80 mg group.
Pre-specified analysis in ITT population.    We performed the primary analysis of the mean change in 6MWD from baseline to 48 weeks specified in the trial protocol in the ITT population. The ITT population included all 174 randomized patients with a valid 6MWT available at baseline and at least one post-baseline visit. Analysis of the results of the ITT population showed that patients in the 40 mg group had notably less decline in their walking ability than the patients taking placebo, with a difference of 29.7 meters between the 40 mg group and placebo in mean change in 6MWD over 48 weeks. Although this result was consistent with the clinically meaningful treatment effect of 30 meters specified in the trial protocol, the resulting nominal p-value of 0.149 was not statistically significant at the pre-specified level of less than 0.05. Typically, a trial result is statistically significant if the chance of it occurring when the treatment is like placebo is less than one in 20, resulting in a p-value of less than 0.05. A nominal p-value is the result of one particular comparison when more than one comparison is possible, such as when two active treatments are compared to placebo or when two or more subgroups are analyzed.
12

In addition, ITT population analysis showed that there was no difference between patients in the 80 mg group from placebo in mean change in 6MWD over 48 weeks. Although unanticipated, this finding is consistent with a bell-shaped dose-response curve that we observed in four subsequent non-clinical studies of Translarna in DMD and other genetic disorders. Under analysis of the ITT population, pre-specified measurements of supportive analyses of ambulation were not reached in any of the three treatment arms of the trial.
Post-hoc analyses of Phase 2b clinical trial data.    Based on our further evaluation of the data from our Phase 2b clinical trial after unblinding the results, we identified three issues affecting the pre-specified statistical analyses. We addressed these issues in a post-hoc, retrospective refinement to the pre-specified statistical analysis plan, resulting in what we refer to as a corrected ITT analysis.

• | Our pre-specified statistical model used to calculate the p-value and significance of the trial results omitted a specific statistical term designed to address the potential relationship between the 6MWD results at baseline and at each subsequent patient visit. As has now become standard practice in analyses of repeated-measures data, we adjusted our statistical model to add this statistical term in preparing the corrected ITT analysis.


• | Because the 6MWD data were non-normally distributed, our pre-specified analysis used rank-transformed data in which the 6MWD values for each patient were ordered from smallest to largest and ranked from one to 174. However, ranking the data in this way did not fully reflect the large variability as measured in meters that we observed in the original 6MWD data. In the corrected ITT analysis, we used a re-randomization test, rather than rank transformation of the data, to address non-normality of the trial data. This re-randomization test allowed analysis of the 6MWD results in meters, rather than ranking the results relative to one another, to more accurately reflect the large variability in walking distances.


• | Two patients had lower limb injuries after screening but prior to their baseline assessment. These injuries substantially affected their walking ability and led to aberrantly low baseline 6MWD values. These baseline 6MWT were incorrectly classified as valid by the investigative site, and the resulting data should not have been included in the ITT analysis. In the corrected ITT analysis, we replaced the baseline values for these two patients with their valid screening values.

The results of our post-hoc analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of this trial are shown in the table below.
Change in 6-minute walk distance from baseline to week 48 (corrected ITT analysis)

 | Treatment arm
Summary of change from baseline to week 48 | Placebo N=57 | Translarna40 mg/kg/dayN=57 | Translarna80 mg/kg/dayN=60
Mean (standard deviation), meters | –44.1 (88.0) | -12.9 (72.0) | | –44.8 (84.8)
Mean difference from placebo, meters | | 31.3 | | –0.7 
Nominal p-value (vs. placebo) | | 0.0281 | | 0.912 
Adjusted p-value (vs. placebo) | | 0.0561 | | 0.991 

In the corrected ITT analysis, the difference between the 40 mg group and placebo group in mean change in 6MWD over 48 weeks was 31.3 meters. We observed clear separation between the 40 mg group and placebo group, with the difference between the arms increasingly favoring the 40 mg group over time. The resulting nominal p-value for the comparison of mean change in 6MWD from baseline to week 48 for the 40 mg group versus placebo was 0.0281. However, because two dose levels were compared to placebo, we were required to apply a multiplicity adjustment, which yielded a final adjusted p-value of 0.0561 for the 40 mg group versus placebo.
Although we believe that our additional analyses of the trial results were warranted, a retrospective analysis performed after unblinding trial results can result in the introduction of bias if the analysis is inappropriately tailored or influenced by knowledge of the data and actual results. In addition, nominal p-values cannot be compared to the benchmark p-value of 0.05 to determine statistical significance without being adjusted for the testing of multiple dose groups or analyses of subgroups. Because of these limitations, regulatory authorities typically give greatest weight to results from pre-specified analyses and adjusted p-values and less weight to results from post-hoc, retrospective analyses and nominal p-values.
Secondary endpoints.    Patients in the 40 mg group trended better than the placebo group in several of the secondary endpoints tracked during this trial, however the trial was not powered to detect statistically significant differences in secondary endpoints. Patients in the 40 mg group exceeded the clinically meaningful threshold of 1.5 seconds for stair-climbing and stair- descending in the ITT analysis and for running/walking in the corrected ITT analysis. In a supine to stand test, we did not observe any 
13

difference between Translarna and placebo. Other secondary endpoints showed trends favoring patients treated with Translarna, but at levels below a threshold considered to be clinically meaningful, including: muscle strength (tested through myometric evaluations), frequency of falls (based on patients/caregiver notation), and health related quality of life and treatment satisfaction (based on patient reports).
Safety and tolerability.    Translarna was generally well tolerated at both dose levels in our Phase 2b clinical trial. There were no study discontinuations due to adverse events. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Investigators’ attributions of drug-related adverse effects were generally similar across the placebo and Translarna arms. The most common adverse events in this trial were vomiting (46.6% overall), headache (29.3%), diarrhea (24.1%), nasopharyngitis (20.7%), fever (19.0%), cough (19.0%) and upper abdominal pain (17.8%). These events were generally balanced across treatment arms and are typical of pediatric illnesses. Adverse events with at least a 10% incidence in any treatment arm that were seen with increased frequency from the placebo group to the Translarna 40 mg dose group to the Translarna 80 mg dose group were nausea (12.3% for placebo, 14.0% for the Translarna 40 mg group and 16.7% for the Translarna 80 mg group), abdominal pain (7.0% for placebo, 12.3% for the Translarna 40 mg group and 16.7% for the Translarna 80 mg group), pain in extremity (10.5% for placebo, 12.3% for the Translarna 40 mg group and 13.3% for the Translarna 80 mg group), flatulence (7.0% for placebo, 8.8% for the Translarna 40 mg group and 11.7% for the Translarna 80 mg group) and nasal congestion (7.0% for placebo, 8.8% for the Translarna 40 mg group and 10.0% for the Translarna 80 mg group). An overview of adverse events in this trial is shown in the table below.

Phase 2a clinical trial of Translarna for nmDMD
In October 2007, we announced the results of an open label Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating Translarna in 38 patients with nmDMD. The primary objective of this trial was to obtain indications of pharmacological activity. The primary efficacy endpoint in this trial was the change from baseline measurement of dystrophin levels in a muscle in the foot known as the extensor digitorum brevis. nmDMD patients enrolled in this trial were at least five years of age, had increased levels of serum creatine kinase, or CK, and had absent or diminished dystrophin protein on muscle biopsy. All participants in the trial received Translarna treatment for 28 days at one of three varying doses (12 mg/kg/day, 40 mg/kg/day and 80 mg/kg/day). In this trial, Translarna induced a mean 11.0% increase in muscle dystrophin expression over the 28 days of treatment, with 23 of the 38 patients (61%) showing an increase from baseline. We observed serum CK reductions in 35 of the 38 patients (92%) at the end of treatment. With cessation of Translarna treatment, mean serum CK concentrations reverted toward baseline. Changes in myometry scores and timed function tests were small and not statistically significant with 28 days of Translarna treatment. Anecdotal reports from the parents and teachers of several boys noted evidence of greater activity, increased endurance and less 
14

fatigue during Translarna administration. Pharmacokinetic results from this trial indicated that both the 40 mg/kg/day and the 80 mg/kg/day dose regimens achieved plasma concentrations of Translarna that were predicted to have a therapeutic effect, based on preclinical data. The 12 mg/kg/day regimen did not consistently achieve these levels, and as a result we did not include this dosing regimen in our subsequent Phase 2b clinical trial.
TranslarnaTM for additional indications
Over the last seven years multiple independent investigators have conducted preclinical studies in which Translarna enabled readthrough of the premature stop codons from a large set of nonsense mutations across a diverse group of experimental models exhibiting various genetic disorders. The studies evaluated the ability of Translarna to read through premature stop codons in mRNA in cell-free systems, transfected cell lines, mouse models and patient cells. Based on these studies by independent investigators in addition to our own trials and studies, we expect to continue to pursue additional indications for Translarna, including aniridia caused by nonsense mutation and, via an investigator initiated study, Dravet syndrome/CDKL5 caused by nonsense mutation.
Nonsense mutation aniridia
Aniridia is a genetic disorder due to mutations in the PAX6 gene associated with ocular anatomical defects at birth, progressive loss of eyesight, and other symptoms. We estimate that approximately one-third of all aniridia cases are due to a nonsense mutation. In a prior study conducted by an independent investigator, Translarna-treated mice with nonsense mutation aniridia showed a significant increase in the PAX6 protein in a nonsense mutation PAX6 gene, but not in mice with a PAX6 gene harboring a splice-site mutation. The investigators in this study found that Translarna not only inhibited disease progression, but also reversed corneal, lens and retinal defects and restored electrical responses of the retina.
The first patient in our clinical study of Translarna in nonsense mutation aniridia, which we refer to as STAR, was dosed in February 2016. STAR is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of Translarna in patients with aniridia caused by a nonsense mutation, followed by an open-label extension study. Patients will receive blinded study drug for 48 weeks followed by open-label Translarna for another 96 weeks. The open label portion of the study was extended from the initially planned 48 weeks to 96 weeks as our knowledge of the disease and endpoint evolved from when the study was originally initiated. Safety and efficacy will be assessed. We have completed enrollment for our aniridia study and anticipate results during 2019.
Nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5
Dravet syndrome and CDKL5 are two different genetically defined disorders of epilepsy. Dravet syndrome, also called severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, is a debilitating form of epilepsy caused by mutations in the sodium voltage gated channel a1 subunit gene required for the proper function of brain cells. People with Dravet syndrome experience frequent seizures and developmental delays. CDKL5 is caused by a mutation of the Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) gene leading to a lack of the protein critical in brain development. CDKL5 is characterized by seizures starting early in life and severe developmental impairment.
A clinical study assessing Translarna in nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome/CDKL5 was initiated in the first quarter of 2017.
Nonsense mutation Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (nmMPS I)
MPS I is an inherited genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in an essential enzyme that is responsible for the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs, byproducts of chemical reactions in the body’s cells. It is estimated that 60 percent to 80 percent of cases of MPS I are caused by a nonsense mutation. 
A clinical study assessing Translarna in nonsense mutation MPSI was initiated in 2015. In the third quarter of 2017 we stopped enrollment and began to wind down our study for Translarna in mucopolysaccharidosis type I caused by nonsense mutation, or nmMPS I, as we encountered difficulties identifying qualified patients for this study. 
Spinal muscular atrophy program
Spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, is a genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle wasting and weakness. The disease generally manifests early in life. SMA is caused by mutation or deletion of the Survival of Motor Neuron 1, or SMN1, gene that encodes the survival of motor neuron, or SMN, protein. The SMN protein is critical to the health and survival of the nerve cells in the spinal cord responsible for muscle contraction. A second gene, SMN2, is very similar to SMN1, except that SMN2 contains a T nucleotide at position 6 in exon 7 that results in alternative splicing and production of reduced levels of functional SMN protein. According to the SMA Foundation, SMA is the leading genetic cause of death in infants and toddlers and that one in approximately 11,000 children is born with the disease. We estimate that SMA affects approximately 20,000 to 30,000 children and adults in the United States, Europe and Japan.

Using our alternative splicing technology and in collaboration with the SMA Foundation, we identified highly potent small molecule splicing modifiers that, in non-clinical studies in cultured cells derived from patients with SMA, increased both the inclusion of exon 7 in the SMN2 mRNA and the levels of SMN protein produced by SMN2. Importantly, in studies in transgenic mice carrying only the SMN2 gene, these orally bioavailable compounds, penetrate the blood-brain barrier and increase the levels of full-length SMN2 mRNA and protein in brain, spinal cord, muscle and other tissues. In these same mouse studies, treatment with these compounds resulted in increased survival, restoration of body weight, prevention of motor neuron loss and improved motor function.
In November 2011, we entered into a collaboration and licensing agreement with Roche which included a $30 million upfront payment, the potential for up to $460 million in milestone payments and royalties on net sales. Roche is responsible for pursuing clinical development of compounds from the research program under the collaboration and then commercializing any resulting products. A lead development compound, RG7800, was selected to move into IND-enabling studies in August 2013, triggering a milestone payment to us from Roche of $10 million. In 2014, we received two milestone payments from Roche totaling $17.5 million, one in January 2014 upon the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical study of RG7800 and in November 2014, upon the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical study of RG7800. In October 2017, we received a $20 million milestone payment from Roche upon the transition into the pivotal second part of the Sunfish study. We also previously received $13.3 million in sponsored research funding for this program from the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation.
RG7800 was formerly the subject of a Phase 2 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study called Moonfish in adult and pediatric patients with SMA. Results from the first cohort in Moonfish, which included 16 adult and adolescent SMA patients, demonstrated that SMN protein can be increased with RG7800, providing proof of mechanism for oral small molecule SMN2 splicing modifiers. Up to three-fold increases in the ratio of full length SMN2 mRNA to SMN2Ä7 mRNA and up to two-fold increases in SMN protein were observed versus baseline, as measured in whole blood. RG7800 was well tolerated over 12 weeks at a dose of 10 mg once daily. In addition, a dose-dependent effect on SMN2 alternative splicing was observed in a previous Phase 1 clinical study of RG7800 in healthy volunteers.
Dosing in the Moonfish trial was suspended in April 2015 and the trial was placed on clinical hold to investigate retinal toxicity observed in a longer term monkey nonclinical safety study. Although RG7800 remains a potential product candidate under the SMA program, the Moonfish trial was terminated in December 2016.
A different compound in the SMA collaboration, RG7916, is currently being advanced in development. In October 2016, a two-part clinical study, called Sunfish, initiated in pediatric and adult type 2 and type 3 SMA patients to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of RG7916. Both parts of Sunfish are double-blinded, placebo-controlled, and randomized. Part one of the study was a dose-finding study in 51 type 2 and type 3 SMA patients randomized 2:1 RG7916 vs. placebo and treated for 12 weeks with the primary objective of evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RG7916 in patients. As presented at the International Scientific Congress on Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Kraków, Poland in January 2018, RG7916 was well tolerated at all doses assessed. There have been no deaths and no drug-related safety findings leading to withdrawal. Bi-monthly ophthalmological monitoring did not show any evidence of retinal toxicity seen in preclinical monkey studies with RG7800. Adverse events were mostly mild, resolved despite ongoing treatment and were reflective of the underlying disease. RG7916 produced a dose-dependent increase in SMN2 FL mRNA and a concomitant decrease in SMN2Ä7 mRNA. SMN protein was increased in a dose-dependent manner up to a median of 2.5-fold. Increases in SMN protein were sustained up to 250 days.
Based on the results from part one of Sunfish, dosing for the second part of the study was selected and the pivotal part two of Sunfish initiated in October 2017, which triggered a $20 million milestone payment to us from Roche. Part one of Sunfish is currently recruiting globally 168 type 2 and type 3 SMA patients who are randomized 2:1 RG7916 vs. placebo for 12 months followed by 12 months of all study participants receiving RG7916 with the primary objective of efficacy of RO7034067 compared to placebo in terms of motor function in Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3 SMA patients, as assessed by the change from baseline in the total score of the motor function measure (MFM) at 12 months. Both part one and part two of the study will be followed by an open-label extension.
Early interim data from Part 1 of the Sunfish study were also presented at the International Scientific Congress on Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Kraków, Poland in January 2018. In type 1 SMA patients RG7916 was well tolerated at all doses and there have been no drug-related safety findings leading to withdrawal. Ophthalmologic monitoring did not show any evidence of the retinal toxicity seen in preclinical monkey studies in any patient exposed to RG7916. Early interim clinical data indicated that no patient lost the ability to swallow and no patient has required tracheostomy or reached permanent ventilation. 
In December 2016, a two-part clinical study, called Firefish, also initiated in infants with type 1 SMA. Part one of Firefish is an open-label, dose escalation study in 8 to 24 infants for a minimum of 4 weeks. The primary objective of part one is to assess the safety profile of RG7916 in infants and determine the dose for part two. 
16

Part two is an open-label, single-arm study in approximately 40 infants with type 1 SMA for 24 months. The primary objective of part two is to assess the efficacy of RG7916 measured as the proportion of infants sitting without support after 12 months of treatment, as assessed in the Gross Motor Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler development - Third Edition (BSID-III) (defined as sitting without support for 5 seconds). We anticipate that Firefish will move into the pivotal second part of the study in the first quarter of 2018. 
Jewelfish, an open-label study investigating the safety, tolerability, PK, and PK/pharmacodynamic relationship of RG7916 in type 2 and type 3 SMA patients who have been previously treated with a survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2)-targeting therapy, initiated in the first quarter of 2017. As recently presented at the International Scientific Congress on Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Kraków in January 2018, preliminary PD data from three Jewelfish patients showed increases in SMN2 FL/SMNÄ7 mRNA ratio and SMN protein increases of up to 4-fold.
Oncology program
Our product candidate PTC596 is a first-in-class, orally bioavailable and potent small molecule that targets solid tumor cell populations by reducing the activity and amount of BMI1. Elevated levels of BMI1 are associated with aggressive, difficult to treat tumors and a poor prognosis for patients in a wide variety of cancers, including glioblastoma. Notably, PTC596 was specifically developed to cross the blood-brain barrier to allow PTC596 to target tumors within the central nervous system as well. In animal models of cancer using xenografted human tumors, twice-weekly oral dosing of PTC596 provided tumor control, including reduction of tumor size. PTC596 in pairwise combinations with commonly used chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel, DTIC, doxorubicin and gemcitabine effectively controlled tumor growth in these animal models. PTC596 is well tolerated at therapeutically effective doses in animals. 
A Phase 1 first-in-human, dose-escalation safety and pharmacokinetic open-label clinical study of PTC596 in advanced cancer patients with solid tumors was initiated in April 2015 and completed in the first quarter of 2017. PTC596 was generally well tolerated as a monotherapy, producing systemic concentrations in patients similar to or exceeding those associated with preclinical activity. Though a protocol-defined maximum tolerated dose was not reached, the dose of 10 mg/kg was deemed intolerable due to pill burden and occurrence of Grade 2 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in two of three patients. Data from this study and continued clinical development of PTC596, including reformulation efforts, are expected during 2018.
We received grant funding of $5.4 million for our oncology program from the Wellcome Trust. To the extent that we develop and commercialize program intellectual property on a for-profit basis ourselves or in collaboration with a partner (provided we retain overall control of worldwide commercialization), we may become obligated to pay to Wellcome Trust development and regulatory milestone payments. Our first such milestone payment of $0.8 million to Wellcome Trust occurred in the second quarter of 2016. For additional information, see “Item 1. Business - Our Collaborations and Funding Arrangements”.
Pre-clinical and other programs
We continue to invest in our pre-clinical product pipeline by committing significant resources to research and development programs and business development opportunities within our areas of scientific expertise, including potential collaborations, alliances, and acquisitions or licensing of assets that complement our strategic mission to leverage our knowledge of RNA biology to bring novel therapeutics to patients affected by rare and neglected disorders.
Scientific Background of Post-Transcriptional Control Processes
Post-transcriptional control processes are the events that occur in a cell following the transcription of DNA into RNA. These processes regulate, for example, how long RNA molecules last in the cell, how precursor messenger RNA, or pre-mRNA, molecules are spliced, and how efficiently mRNA molecules are translated to produce a protein.
In the majority of human protein-encoding genes, the sequence representing the mature mRNA transcript is not contiguous but rather has an interrupted structure consisting of nucleotide sequences that are removed from the final mRNA product (these sequences are called introns) and nucleotide sequences that are retained in the mature mRNA (exons). The process of intron removal and exon joining is called splicing.
An mRNA contains multiple regions that have specific functions. Although the protein coding region of mRNA contains the information for the amino acid sequence of the protein product, several regions of mRNA do not code for the protein and are known as untranslated regions, or UTRs. They are unique to specific mRNAs or groups of mRNAs and are directly involved in the post-transcriptional control of protein production. Interactions of cellular factors with the UTRs on the mRNA determine when and how much protein is produced as well as how mRNA is degraded and eliminated from the cell.
Our Approach
17

Our approach to drug discovery and development is to target systematically post-transcriptional control processes by small molecule therapeutics. We believe that focusing on post-transcriptional control processes will enable us to both address known drug targets through new mechanisms of action and to pursue a broad range of targets that have previously not been amenable to drug discovery. We believe that a large number of promising post-transcriptional control drug targets remain unexploited, providing a significant opportunity for our integrated and systematic approach to drug discovery. This approach has broad applicability to address intractable drug targets in a wide variety of diseases for which there is an unmet medical need, including genetic disorders and cancer.
Our RNA Biology Focused Small Molecule Technology Platform
We have developed and assembled an integrated set of proprietary technologies focused on our understanding of RNA biology for the discovery of small molecules that target post-transcriptional control processes. Our technologies enable us to screen our compound library against targets in many different therapeutic areas in an expeditious and cost-effective manner. Our efforts span from target identification and characterization to the identification of selective lead molecules. From these lead molecules, our research team undertakes a chemical optimization program designed to select an appropriate development candidate. We refer to our technologies as GEMS (gene expression modulation by small-molecules), alternative splicing, and nonsense suppression.
Alternative splicing
We use our alternative splicing technology to identify molecules that modulate splicing of the pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA splicing is a multi-step biochemical reaction. Approximately 94% of all human genes encode pre-mRNAs that undergo splicing. In addition, through alternative splicing, one gene can often generate several mRNA products by including or excluding exons that can result in the mRNA being regulated differently or translated into different proteins. Altered regulation of alternative splicing is the direct cause of many human diseases, including many forms of cancer, SMA, Riley-Day syndrome (familial dysautonomia) and myotonic dystrophy.
We have developed a powerful high-throughput drug discovery technology that enables us to identify small molecule modifiers of pre-mRNA splicing. The technology relies on a sensitive quantification of mRNA directly in human cells or tissue samples. Using this technology, we have successfully identified orally bioavailable small molecules that correct splicing of the Survival of Motor Neuron 2, or SMN2, mRNA, which is implicated in the genetic disorder SMA. Based on this experience, we believe that other small molecule drug candidates can be rapidly identified that correct alternative splicing of pre-mRNA, promote inclusion of specific exons into mRNA or force skipping of undesired exons from the mature mRNA. We believe that this technology is potentially widely applicable to a large number of target genes in all therapeutic areas.
GEMS
We use our GEMS technology to identify molecules that modulate gene expression by targeting the post-transcriptional control processes that act through the UTRs of mRNA molecules. The UTRs of mRNA can have important roles in regulating protein production because they contain the instructions for determining the protein production efficiency and how long a given mRNA molecule will remain within the cell before being degraded.
Target proteins of potential biological and medical relevance to human disease are assessed for the prevalence of regulation through the unique UTRs. Once a target is selected, we precisely define the UTR and generate proprietary assays to screen our library of compounds to identify those that enhance or inhibit expression of the target gene by modulating the post-transcriptional control processes that act through the 5’- and 3’- UTRs of the target mRNA.
Nonsense suppression
We use our nonsense suppression technology to identify molecules that promote or enhance readthrough of premature stop codons in the mRNA. The presence of a premature stop codon results in translation termination before a full-length protein can be produced. Our nonsense suppression technologies identify small molecules that increase readthrough at the premature stop codon by facilitating the incorporation of a defined set of amino acids at the site of the premature stop codon resulting in the production a full-length protein. We anticipate that this approach will be applicable to a wide variety of therapeutic areas.
In addition to identifying molecules that increase readthrough, we are identifying molecules that can enhance the nonsense suppression effect of Translarna and other readthrough agents by preventing the decay of nonsense-mutation containing mRNAs, a process known as nonsense mediated decay. We have developed a high throughput screen to identify molecules that increase the level of and stabilize premature stop codon-containing mRNAs. We can evaluate the effect of these molecules alone and in combination with Translarna in cell-based models of disease, identify lead compounds and initiate a chemical optimization program. We are currently in the process of evaluating compounds as single agents and in combination with readthrough compounds in preparation for an optimization program.

Our Collaborations and Funding Arrangements
We currently have ongoing collaborations with Roche and the SMA Foundation. We also have received grant funding from Wellcome Trust pursuant to funding agreements under which we have continuing obligations. In addition to these material collaboration and funding agreements, which are described in more detail below, during 2015 we announced our research collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital, or MGH, a Partners Healthcare hospital, for the treatment of rare genetic disorders resulting from pre-mRNA splicing defects pursuant to which we have certain licensing, development and commercialization obligations to MGH.
Roche and the SMA Foundation
Overview.    In November 2011, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Roche and the SMA Foundation to further develop and commercialize compounds identified under our SMA sponsored research program with the SMA Foundation and to research other small molecule compounds with potential for therapeutic use in patients with SMA. The research term of this agreement was terminated effective December 31, 2014. The ongoing collaboration is governed by a joint steering committee consisting of an equal number of representatives of us, the SMA Foundation and Roche. We, the SMA Foundation and Roche have agreed to endeavor to make decisions by consensus, but if the joint steering committee cannot reach agreement after following a specified decision resolution procedure, Roche’s decision will control. However, Roche may not exercise its final decision-making authority with respect to certain specified matters, including any decision that would increase our or the SMA Foundation’s obligations, reduce our or the SMA Foundation’s rights, expand Roche’s rights, or reduce Roche’s obligations under the license and collaboration agreement.
Commercialization.    We have granted Roche worldwide exclusive licenses, with the right to grant sublicenses, to our patent rights and know-how with respect to such compounds and products. Roche is responsible for pursuing worldwide clinical development of compounds from the research program and has the exclusive right to develop and commercialize compounds from the collaboration.
Payments and Contingent Payments.    Pursuant to the license and collaboration agreement, Roche paid us an upfront non-refundable payment of $30.0 million. During the research term, which was terminated effective December 31, 2014, Roche provided us with funding, based on an agreed- upon full-time equivalent rate, for an agreed-upon number of full- time equivalent employees that we contributed to the research program. We are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $135 million in payments if specified development and regulatory milestones are achieved and up to an aggregate of $325 million in payments if specified sales milestones are achieved. As of December 31, 2017, we have earned $47.5 million of these development and regulatory milestone payments based on the progression of the collaboration from the pre-clinical stage to Phase 2 clinical study in SMA patients. We are also entitled to tiered single-digit to mid-teen royalties on worldwide net product sales of products developed pursuant to the collaboration. Roche’s obligation to pay us royalties will expire generally on a country-by- country basis at the latest of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering a product in the given country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for that product in such country or 10 years from the first commercial sale of that product in such country. However, the royalties payable to us may be decreased in certain circumstances. For example, the royalty rate in a particular country is reduced if the product is not protected by patents in that country and no longer entitled to regulatory exclusivity in that country. We remain responsible for making any payments to the SMA Foundation that may become due under our pre-existing sponsored research agreement with the SMA Foundation.
Termination.    Unless terminated earlier, the license and collaboration agreement will expire on the date when no royalty or other payment obligations are or will become due under the agreement. Roche’s termination rights under the license and collaboration agreement include the right to terminate the agreement at any time after November 22, 2013 on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon three months’ notice before the launch of the applicable product or upon nine months’ notice thereafter; and the right to terminate the agreement in specified circumstances following a change of control of us. The license and collaboration agreement provides that we or Roche may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured breach by the other party of a material provision of the agreement, or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon termination of the collaboration agreement by Roche for convenience or termination by us as a result of Roche’s breach, bankruptcy, change of control or patent challenge, we have the right to assume the development and commercialization of product candidates arising from the license and collaboration agreement. In that event, we may become obligated to pay royalties to Roche on sales of any such product.
SMA Foundation
Overview.    In June 2006, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with the SMA Foundation under which we and the SMA Foundation have collaborated in the research and preclinical development of small molecule therapeutics for SMA. As discussed above, we are also collaborating with the SMA Foundation and Roche to further develop these compounds. Pursuant 
19

to the sponsored research agreement, as amended, the SMA Foundation provided us with $13.3 million in funding. The SMA Foundation is not obligated to provide any further funding under this agreement.
Continuing financial obligations.    We may become obligated to pay the SMA Foundation single-digit royalties on worldwide net product sales of any collaboration product that we successfully develop and subsequently commercialize or, if we outlicense rights to a collaboration product, a specified percentage of certain payments we receive from our licensee. As discussed above, we have outlicensed rights to Roche pursuant to a license and collaboration agreement. We are not obligated to make such payments unless and until annual sales of a collaboration product exceed a designated threshold. Our obligation to make such payments would end upon our payment to the SMA Foundation of a specified amount, which we refer to as the repayment amount.
Reversion rights.    In specified circumstances, including those involving our decision to discontinue development or commercialization of a collaboration product, our uncured failure to meet agreed timelines or those that might arise following our change of control, we may be obligated to grant the SMA Foundation exclusive or non-exclusive sublicensable rights under our intellectual property, in certain collaboration products, among other rights, to assume the development and commercialization of such collaboration products and to provide the SMA Foundation with other transitional assistance, which we refer to as a reversion. In some such cases, we may be entitled to receive licensing fee payments from the SMA Foundation and single-digit royalties on sales of the applicable collaboration product, which amounts we collectively refer to as reversion payments. In other cases, the SMA Foundation is not required to make any payments to us in connection with the licenses it receives from us.
Termination.    Unless terminated earlier, the sponsored research agreement will continue until the earliest of the SMA Foundation’s receipt of the repayment amount or, if there was a reversion, either our receipt of all reversion payments that the SMA Foundation may be obligated to make to us or, if the SMA Foundation is not obligated to make reversion payments, the expiration of the last-to-expire patent we licensed to the SMA Foundation in connection with such reversion. The sponsored research agreement provides that either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency.
Wellcome Trust 
We have two separate funding agreements with Wellcome Trust for the research and development of small molecule compounds in connection with our oncology and antibacterial programs. Pursuant to the agreement relating to the antibacterial program, Wellcome Trust awarded us a $5.0 million grant of which we received $4.8 million between 2011 and 2015. We are no longer actively pursuing an antibacterial program and do not expect to receive additional funding under this agreement. The materials terms of these funding agreements are similar in substance, except as described below. 
The other agreement, entered into in May 2010, relates to the research and development of small molecule compounds, which we refer to as our oncology program. Pursuant to this agreement, Wellcome Trust awarded us a $5.4 million grant, of which approximately $0.9 million was paid in connection with execution of the agreement and the balance of which was paid to us in 2010 and 2012 based on our achievement of specified milestones.
Development and commercialization.    We own all intellectual property that arises from the conduct of the research programs under these funding agreements, which we refer to as program intellectual property, and are responsible for developing and commercializing the program intellectual property, including PTC596 (for our oncology program), and other compounds. However, we will require Wellcome Trust’s written consent prior to any such development or commercialization. If Wellcome Trust withholds such consent and we and Wellcome Trust are not able to resolve Wellcome Trust’s concerns, the parties have agreed to follow a specified dispute resolution procedure that gives neither party final decision-making authority.
Reversion rights.    Under both funding agreements, if we fail to take reasonable steps to develop or commercialize program intellectual property during specified timeframes, we may be obligated to grant exclusive rights to Wellcome Trust or its nominee under the program intellectual property, along with non-exclusive rights under our background intellectual property, so that Wellcome Trust or its nominee can assume such development and commercialization. If we grant such a license, we would be entitled to a share of any consideration received by Wellcome Trust in connection with any subsequent development or commercialization of program intellectual property on a for-profit basis, which share would be proportionate to our contribution to the development and commercialization.
Continuing financial obligations-oncology program.    To the extent that we develop and commercialize program intellectual property on a for-profit basis ourselves or in collaboration with a partner (provided we retain overall control of worldwide commercialization), we may become obligated to pay to Wellcome Trust development and regulatory milestone payments and single-digit royalties on sales of any research program product under our oncology program. We made the first development milestone payment of $0.8 million to Wellcome Trust under this agreement during the second quarter of 2016. Additional development and regulatory milestone payments up to an aggregate of $22.4 million may become payable by us under the 
20

agreement. For example, in the event a Phase 2 clinical study of a research program candidate, such as PTC596, is commenced, a milestone payment of $2.5 million would become payable by us to Wellcome Trust upon the earlier to occur of the first dose administered to the last patient enrolled in the study or the termination of dosing of all patients in the study.
Additional continuing financial obligations.    Our obligation to pay the royalties describe above would continue on a country-by-country basis until the longer of the expiration of the last patent in the program intellectual property in such country covering the research program product and the expiration of market exclusivity of such product in such country. To the extent that we develop and commercialize program intellectual property on a for-profit basis through outlicensing, we will be obligated to pay to Wellcome Trust a specified share of any consideration we receive from our licensee, provided that Wellcome Trust would be entitled to receive a minimum amount equal to its original contribution. We would incur no payment obligations to Wellcome Trust to the extent that we elect to develop and commercialize program intellectual property on a non-profit basis.
Termination.    Unless terminated earlier, each funding agreement will continue until we have received the full amount of the grant, the research program has ended, the last-to-expire of the patents in the program intellectual property has expired, any agreement entered into for the exploitation of the program intellectual property or our background intellectual property has expired, and there are no remaining payment obligations relating to the exploitation of the program intellectual property or our background intellectual property. Each funding agreement provides that either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency and that Wellcome Trust may terminate the agreement under specified circumstances, including, among others, in specified circumstances following a change in control of us or if Wellcome Trust believes that an uncorrected serious failure exists in the progress, management or conduct of the research program or that an act or omission by us is incompatible with or has an adverse effect on Wellcome Trust’s charitable objectives or reputation.
If Wellcome Trust terminates either or both funding agreements in specified circumstances, including as a result of our material breach, bankruptcy or insolvency, or following our change of control, we may be obligated to assign to Wellcome Trust ownership of the applicable program intellectual property, grant to Wellcome Trust royalty-free non-exclusive rights under the applicable background intellectual property for the continuation of the research program (if applicable) and the development and commercialization of the applicable program intellectual property, and provide Wellcome Trust with other specified transitional assistance.
Certain specified rights and obligations of the parties will generally survive termination of the funding agreements, including Wellcome Trust’s right to receive payments from us with respect to development and commercialization of program intellectual property on a for-profit basis.
If a funding agreement terminates prior to the end of a research program, we are obligated to return all funding we received from Wellcome Trust that is unspent at the date of termination (after deduction of costs and non-cancellable commitments incurred prior to such date).
Intellectual Property
Patents and trade secrets
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business, where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
As of January 31, 2018, our patent portfolio included a total of 100 active U.S. patents and 22 pending U.S. patent applications, including original filings, continuations and divisional applications, as well as numerous foreign counterparts to many of these patents and patent applications. We own or exclusively in-license these patents and patent applications with claims directed to the composition of matter, pharmaceutical formulation and methods of use of many of our compounds, including ataluren, the active ingredient in the formulated product TranslarnaTM.
The patent rights relating to TranslarnaTM (ataluren) owned by us consist of 32 issued U.S. patents relating to composition of matter, methods of use, formulation, dosing regimen and methods of manufacture and multiple pending patent applications relating to composition of matter, methods of use, formulation, and dosing regimen. We do not license any material patent rights relating to ataluren to unaffiliated parties. The issued U.S. patents relating to composition of matter are currently scheduled to expire in 2024 and all U.S. patents that issue from U.S. patent applications arising from the composition of matter would also be scheduled to expire in 2024. Issued U.S. patents relating to therapeutic method of use are currently scheduled to expire in 2026 and 2027, including patent term adjustment. We have patent rights that are the subject of granted patents or 
21

pending counterpart patent applications in a number of other jurisdictions, including Canada, South America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia and Eurasia. We own nine granted European patents relating to composition of matter, uses, dosing regimen and methods of manufacture of ataluren, as well as multiple pending European patent applications relating to composition of matter, uses and formulations. The expiration dates of the granted and allowed European patents occur for composition of matter in 2024, for dosing regimen patents in 2026 and 2027, and for the manufacturing process in 2027. Except as indicated above, the anticipated expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension, patent term adjustment or other marketing exclusivities that may be available to us.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a U.S. patent that covers a drug, biological product or medical device approved pursuant to a pre-market approval, or PMA, may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date set for the patent. Patent extension based on Hatch-Waxman cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be granted an extension and only those claims reading on the approved drug may be extended.
Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. One means of patent term extension in Europe after EMA approval is based on obtaining a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC). We have applied for SPCs for ataluren in all applicable European countries in which we have a European patent and expect that all will be granted. The maximum patent term extension provided by an SPC is a total of 5 years from the date of patent term expiration. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or other non-European foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors.
We presently have no patent rights to protect the approved use of Emflaza, and we rely on non-patent market exclusivity periods under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, or the Orphan Drug Act, and the Drug Price Competition and the Hatch-Waxman Act to commercialize Emflaza in the United States. See “Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-Hatch-Waxman exclusivity” for further information regarding the exclusivity periods that we rely on.
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
License agreements
We are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications and other intellectual property from third parties. We enter into these agreements to augment our proprietary intellectual property portfolio. The licensed intellectual property covers some of the compounds that we are researching and developing, some post-transcriptional control targets and some of the scientific processes that we use. These licenses impose various diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing or distribution facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of Translarna, Emflaza or for our other product candidates or compounds that we are testing in our preclinical programs. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of clinical and commercial supplies of Translarna, Emflaza as well as any other product or product candidate that we may develop, other than small amounts of compounds that we may synthesize ourselves for preclinical testing.
The active pharmaceutical ingredients in Translarna. Emflaza and our product candidates are provided by third-parties. We currently rely on a single source for the production of some of our raw materials and we obtain our supply of the drug substance 
22

for Translarna from two third-party manufacturers and the drug substance for our oncology program through another third-party manufacturer.
We engage two separate manufacturers to provide bulk drug product for Translarna. We have a relationship with three manufacturers that are capable of providing fill and finish services for our finished commercial and clinical Translarna product, although we are still in the process of finalizing arrangements with one of these manufacturers with respect to commercial product services. 
We do not currently have any agreements with third-party manufacturers for the long-term commercial supply of Translarna or any of our product candidates, although we may seek to establish such arrangements in the future. We may be unable to conclude agreements for commercial or clinical supply with third-party manufacturers, or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms.
We currently obtain our supplies of Translarna and our other product candidates from our third-party manufacturers pursuant to agreements that include specific supply timelines and volume expectations. If a manufacturer should become unavailable to us for any reason, we would seek to obtain supply from another manufacturer engaged by us for the applicable product or service. In the event that we were unable to procure the applicable supply from a validated manufacturer, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements for each of our outsourced services, however we likely would experience delays in our ability to supply Translarna to patients or in advancing our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers.
We obtain our supply of the drug substance for Emflaza through a third-party manufacturer that is currently the only third-party manufacturer qualified to provide Emflaza drug substance. All of our drug product manufacturing, processing and packaging needs for Emflaza tablet and suspension product are fulfilled pursuant to two different exclusive supply agreements assumed by us in connection with our acquisition of Emflaza. We expect to fulfill all of our requirements for Emflaza tablets as well as secondary packaging of pre-filled Emflaza oral suspension bottles pursuant to one of these agreements, which has an initial term of five years. We expect to fulfill all of our requirements for Emflaza suspension product pursuant to the other agreement. Through the seventh year anniversary of FDA approval of Emflaza, we are obligated to pay to the manufacturer of the Emflaza suspension product royalty payments, on a quarterly basis, based on a percentage (ranging from low to middle-low double digits) of, or a fixed payment with respect to, our annual net sales of suspension product in the United States, subject to reduction in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The royalty payments for the suspension product are subject to a minimum aggregate annual payment ranging from €0.5 million to €1.5 million per year.
If our drug substance provider or either of our drug product manufacturers was to be unable to provide drug substance or manufacture Emflaza product in sufficient quantities to meet projected demand, future sales could be adversely affected, which in turn could have a detrimental impact on our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the United States and on our ability to commercialize Emflaza, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and results of operations. Further, as we presently have no patent rights to protect the approved use of Emflaza, we expect to rely market exclusivity periods available to us under the Orphan Drug Act and Hatch-Waxman Act to commercialize Emflaza for DMD in the United States. As the holder of orphan exclusivity, we are required to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of Emflaza to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in loss of the drug's orphan exclusivity in the United States, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from sales of Emflaza.
All of our drug candidates are organic compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. We have selected these compounds not only on the basis of their potential efficacy and safety, but also for their ease of synthesis and reasonable cost of their starting materials. Translarna is manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes. Our raw materials are not scarce and are readily available. We currently rely on a single source for the production of some raw materials and switching to an alternative source could, in some instances, take time and could lead to delays in manufacturing. No shortages or delays of raw materials were encountered in 2017, and none are currently expected in 2018. The chemistry is amenable to scale up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
Manufacturers and suppliers of product candidates are subject to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements, and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our third-party suppliers and manufacturers for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards.
We currently have a contract with a pharmacy and hospital distributor in the European Union that distributes Translarna for clinical programs and limited commercial and EAP programs. We have engaged with third party logistic providers, or 3PLs, which distribute Translarna for the majority of our commercial and EAP programs on our behalf.
We utilize third parties for the commercial distribution of Emflaza, including a 3PL to warehouse Emflaza as well as a specialty pharmacy to sell and distribute Emflaza to patients. The specialty pharmacy provides us with third-party call center services to 
23

provide patient support and financial services, prescription intake and distribution, reimbursement adjudication, and ongoing compliance support. 
Research and Development Expense and Other Financial Information
The research and development expenses in each of our last three fiscal years is provided in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Financial information about our net product revenues, net loss per share attributable to our common stockholders and our total assets are provided in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Commercial Matters
Sales and marketing team
Our product revenue has been attributable to sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States and to sales of Emflaza for treatment of DMD in the United States. In addition to the United States and multiple European countries, we have employees in Latin America and Canada. As of December 31, 2017, our commercial team was comprised of approximately 100 employees, including support personnel and members of our commercial team who work with physicians, patient advocacy groups and other stakeholders who are involved in the treatment of patients suffering from DMD and nmDMD.
In addition, in select territories, we have engaged full time consultants, marketing partners and distribution partners to assist us with our international commercialization efforts for Translarna. We continue to evaluate new territories to determine in which geographies we might, if approved, choose to commercialize Translarna ourselves and in which geographies we might choose to collaborate with third parties. We expect that our internal team and partnership network will continue to grow, as needed, to maximize access to patients. 
Customers
During 2017, our product revenue was attributable to Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and to Emflaza for treatment of DMD. Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD was available on a commercial basis or via reimbursed EAP programs in multiple territories outside of the United States. In some territories orders for Translarna are placed directly with us and in other territories we have engaged with third-party distributors. As a result, orders for Translarna are generally received from hospital and retail pharmacies and, in some cases, one of our third-party partner distributors. Our third-party distributors act as intermediaries between us and end-users and do not typically stock significant quantities of Translarna. The ultimate payor for Translarna is typically a government authority or institution or a third-party health insurer. The payment terms are generally 30 to 90 days after receipt of products.
Emflaza for treatment of DMD is available on a commercial basis throughout the United States. We utilize a single, exclusive specialty pharmacy to sell and distribute Emflaza to patients. The specialty pharmacy receives prescription orders for Emflaza directly from physicians and ships Emflaza directly to the end-user upon fulfillment of the order. As such, there is very little inventory of Emflaza stocked. The ultimate payor for Emflaza is typically a state health insurance program or a third-party health insurer. The payment terms are generally 30 to 90 days after receipt of products. 
During 2017, over 10% of our net product sales were attributable to orders from three of our distributors. Financial information about our net product revenues and other revenues generated in the principal geographic regions in which we operate and our long-lived assets is set forth in our financial statements and in Note 14, “Geographic Information” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Translarna and Emflaza can generally only be returned if agreed upon in writing by us and the product is not opened nor in receipt by the final user, except in the case of quality issues associated with the product. Product is generally shipped when a specific patient is approved by the applicable government or insurer and an individual prescription has been written. The right of return is eliminated as a matter of course when the product is dispensed to patients. We have never had a request for a product return for either Translarna or Emflaza.
In some countries, including those in Latin America, orders for named patient sales may be for multiple months of therapy, which can lead to an unevenness in orders which could result in significant fluctuations in quarterly net product sales.
Geographical Information 
We view our operations and manage our business in one operating segment. As of and for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we have $49.2 million, $1.2 million, and $5.2 million, respectively, in U.S. based revenue. As of and for the 
24

years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we have $145.2 million, $81.5 million, and $31.6 million, respectively, in non-U.S. based revenue. 
Market Access Considerations
Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is currently available on a commercial basis in Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom (including England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales). Commercial drug is also currently available in Germany, subject to the matters discussed below. We consider Translarna to be commercially available when a reference price for the drug is established in the applicable country and we are permitted to market treatment to patients.
Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD is also currently available through EAP programs in select countries where funded named patient or cohort programs exist, both within the EEA and in other territories. These programs generally reference the EMA’s determinations with respect to our marketing authorization in the EEA. As of today, Translarna is available under EAP or similar styled programs in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Cyprus, Ecuador, France, Greece, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey. Generally, EAP programs allow for access to Translarna pursuant to a named patient program, under which a physician requests access to Translarna on behalf of the specific, or “named” patient or pursuant to a cohort program, which allows for a broader temporary authorization for use for nmDMD meeting the inclusion criteria. Our EAP programs are named patient or similar styled programs in all territories other than France, which is a cohort program.
Our ability to make Translarna available via commercial or EAP programs is dependent upon our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five years and older. The marketing authorization is subject to annual review and renewal by the European Commission following reassessment by the EMA as well as the specific obligation to conduct and submit the results of Study 041. See “Item 1. Business-Marketing authorization matters for Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy-European Economic Area” and “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates” for further information regarding the marketing authorization in the EEA and related risks.
Our future revenues from Translarna, Emflaza and any other product candidates we may develop, depends largely on our ability to obtain and maintain reimbursement from governments and third-party insurers. Each country in the EEA has its own pricing and reimbursement regulations and many countries in the EEA have other regulations related to the marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products in the applicable country. The pricing and reimbursement process varies from country to country and can take a substantial amount of time from initiation to complete. As a result, our commercial launch in the EEA has been and is expected to continue to be on a country-by-country basis and we generally will not be able to commence commercial sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD pursuant to our marketing authorization in the EEA in any particular member state of the EEA until we conclude the applicable pricing and reimbursement negotiations and comply with any licensing, employment or related regulatory requirements in that country.
We have submitted pricing and reimbursement dossiers with respect to Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in key EEA countries and have received both pricing and reimbursement approval on terms that are acceptable to us in a number of countries. The price that is approved by local governmental authorities pursuant to commercial pricing and reimbursement processes may be lower than the price that can be realized for purchases of product in that country pursuant to a reimbursed early access program.
In some instances, reimbursement may be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers. For example, in France, EAP programs and commercial sales of a product can begin while pricing and reimbursement rates are under discussion with the applicable government health programs. In the event that the negotiated price of the product is lower than the amount reimbursed for sales made prior to the conclusion of price negotiations, we may become obligated to repay such excess amount to the applicable government health program. Such retroactive reimbursement would be made following the conclusion of price negotiations with the applicable government health authority.
We delisted Translarna from the German pharmacy ordering system, effective April 1, 2016, based on unsustainable pricing established by the arbitration board in Germany. However, patients and healthcare professionals in Germany have generally been able to access Translarna through a reimbursed importation pathway possible under German law. There can be no assurance that all such patients will continue to be successful in obtaining reimbursed access to Translarna.
In England, our pricing and reimbursement negotiations took place between mid-2014 to mid-2016, and culminated in a five-year managed access agreement between us, NHS England, NICE, and other interested parties. The managed access agreement establishes the clinical details surrounding the use of Translarna, including the confidential financial terms and the collection of further data on the efficacy of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD with NICE guidance to be reviewed again at the end of the five-year period, before future funding decisions are taken.
25

For Emflaza, we are engaged in pricing, coverage and reimbursement discussions with third-party payors, such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private commercial insurance plans and pharmacy benefit management plans. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and the amount of reimbursement to be provided for Emflaza are made on a plan-by-plan, and in some cases, on a patient-by-patient basis. Coverage and reimbursement decisions by third-party payors, including the processing and adjudication of prescriptions, may vary from weeks to several months. Certain third-party payors routinely impose additional requirements before approving reimbursement of a prescription, including prior authorization and the requirement to try another therapy first. The specialty pharmacy we utilize provides patient services program to support product access and, when eligible, out-of-pocket assistance. 
We record revenue net of estimated third party discounts and rebates. Allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time revenues from product sales are recognized. These allowances are adjusted to reflect known changes in factors and may impact such allowances in the quarter those changes are known.
For important information regarding market access and pricing and reimbursement considerations see “Item 1. Business-Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and our Product Candidates” and “-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates”.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in some cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. This may have the effect of making branded products less attractive, from a cost perspective, to buyers.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of Translarna, Emflaza and our other product candidates are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
The competition for Translarna, Emflaza and our other product candidates includes the following:

• | Translarna for nmDMD. There is currently no marketed therapy, other than Translarna in the EEA, which has received approval for the treatment of the underlying cause of nmDMD. Sarepta Therapeutics recently received approval in the United States for a treatment addressing the underlying cause of disease for different mutations in the DMD gene. Other biopharmaceutical companies are developing treatments addressing the underlying cause of disease for different mutations in the DMD gene (Sarepta, Daiichi Sankyo, and Nippon Shinyaku). 


• | Translarna for Other Indications. Diacomit is marketed in the European Union by Laboratoires Biocodex for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. Other companies are also pursuing product candidates for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, including GW Pharmaceuticals, Zogenix, and Insys Therapeutics. Aniridia therapeutic interventions, such as artificial iris implantation, are being developed by HumanOptics AG. 


• | Emflaza for DMD. The FDA has not approved a corticosteroid specifically for DMD in the United States other than Emflaza. However, prednisone, which is not approved for DMD in the United States, is generically available and has been prescribed off label for DMD patients. 


• | Spinal Muscular Atrophy Collaboration. Our SMA collaboration with Roche and the SMA Foundation also faces competition. For example, in December 2016, the FDA approved nusinersen, a drug developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and marketed by Biogen, to treat SMA. AveXis, Inc. is also evaluating a gene therapy product 

26

candidate for the treatment of SMA. Other companies are also pursuing product candidates for the treatment of SMA, including Trophos (also in collaboration with Roche), Kowa, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, and Cytokinetics.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, quality control, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, recordkeeping, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates” for important information regarding some of the risks to our business arising as a result of government regulation.
U.S. government regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable FDA requirements at any time pre- or post-approval may result in a delay of approval or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The new drug approval process
Failures to comply with the applicable FDA requirements at any time during the product development process or approval process may result in a delay of approval or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
In the United States, the information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain approval to market a new drug varies depending upon whether the drug is a new product whose safety and efficacy have not previously been demonstrated in humans or a drug whose active ingredients and certain other properties are the same as those of a previously approved drug. A New Drug Application, or NDA, is the vehicle through which the FDA approves a new pharmaceutical product for sale and marketing in the United States.
To market a new drug in the United States, a sponsor generally must undertake the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and other applicable laws or regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for clinical testing, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, prior to initiation and subject to continuing review;


• | completion of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, and the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, E6 GCP guidelines, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each of its proposed indications;


• | submission and FDA acceptance of an NDA, or satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee meeting, if applicable;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, which require that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. In order to begin clinical testing, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA, which includes, among other things, the 
27

results of the preclinical tests, manufacturing information, analytical data, proposed clinical protocols, and any available clinical data or literature on the drug product. Some preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. In other words, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. All research subjects or their legally authorized representatives must provide their informed consent in writing prior to their participation in a clinical trial. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB and is subject to ongoing IRB monitoring. The IRB must approve the protocol, protocol amendments, and the informed consent form. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, to be publicly posted on the Clinicaltrials.gov website.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 clinical trials may be conducted in patients or healthy volunteers to evaluate the product’s safety, dosage tolerance and pharmacokinetics and, if possible, seek to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve controlled trials in a larger but still relatively small number of subjects from the relevant patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks; and provide a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of the drug for specific indications.
Phase 2 clinical trials are sometimes denoted by companies as Phase 2a or Phase 2b clinical trials. Phase 2a clinical trials typically represent the first human clinical trial of a drug candidate in a smaller patient population and are designed to provide earlier information on drug safety and efficacy. Phase 2b clinical trials typically involve larger numbers of patients or longer durations of therapy and may involve comparison with placebo, standard treatments or other active comparators.
Phase 3 clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety in an expanded patient population. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve comparison with placebo, standard treatments or other active comparators. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk- benefit profile of the product or product candidate and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials are usually larger, more time consuming, more complex and more costly than Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.
Clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the sponsor, or a data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial if the trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the research has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA typically requires that an NDA include data from two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, but approval may be based upon a single adequate and well-controlled clinical trial plus confirmatory evidence. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA on the applicant’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies.
The FDA’s accelerated approval process allows for potentially faster development and approval of certain drugs intended to treat serious or life- threatening illnesses that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. Under the accelerated approval process, the adequate and well-controlled clinical trials conducted with the drug establish that the drug has an effect on a “surrogate” endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical benefit other than survival or irreversible morbidity. Drugs approved through the accelerated approval process are subject to certain post-approval requirements, including that the applicant complete Phase 4 clinical trials to demonstrate the drug’s clinical benefit. If the trials fail to verify the clinical benefit of the drug, the FDA may withdraw approval of the application through a streamlined process.
The FDA has explained in guidance that some drugs are dependent upon the use of an in vitro diagnostic test, such as when the use of the drug is limited to a specific patient subpopulation that can be identified by using the test. The guidance refers to the diagnostic tests used with these types of drugs as in vitro companion diagnostic devices. According to the guidance, in vitro companion diagnostic devices may require the submission and approval of a preauthorization application before they are marketed. Some in vitro companion diagnostic devices, however, could potentially be cleared through a 510(k) premarket notification submission. The guidance states that the FDA generally will not approve a drug that is dependent upon the use of an in vitro companion diagnostic device if no such device is FDA- approved or -cleared for the relevant indication. According to the guidance, however, the FDA may approve such a drug without an approved or cleared in vitro companion diagnostic 
28

device when the drug is intended to treat a serious or life- threatening condition for which no satisfactory alternative treatment exists and the FDA determines that the benefits from the use of drug with an unapproved or uncleared in vitro companion diagnostic device are so pronounced as to outweigh the risks from the lack of an approved or cleared in vitro companion diagnostic device. Because of the severity of dystrophinopathies and the lack of satisfactory available treatments, the FDA confirmed in its recently-issued guidance that it may approve a drug even if an in vitro companion diagnostic device has not yet been approved or cleared, if the benefits from the drug are so pronounced to outweigh the risks posed by the lack of an approved or cleared in vitro companion diagnostic device. The FDA guidance documents represent the FDA’s current thinking on a topic but do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including proposed labeling and information on the chemistry, manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee, though a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review.
If the FDA determines that the NDA is incomplete, the FDA may refuse to file the application. If the FDA refuses to file an NDA, the applicant may request an informal conference with the FDA about whether the application should be filed. After the conference, the applicant may request that the application be filed over protest. When an application is filed over protest, the FDA is required to review the application as filed. Generally, the FDA does not favor the file over protest procedure and the FDA’s policies explain that an application filed over protest does not receive a timeline for review and is designated a standard review.
In addition, an applicant that receives an RTF can, in some circumstances, appeal the decision using the FDA’s dispute resolution procedures. After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has 12 months after submission of an NDA in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and eight months for a priority review NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for review of NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by additional three month review periods whenever the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time during the review cycle.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. As the FDA has not issued regulations applying PREA to orphan-designated indications, submission of a pediatric assessment is not presently required for an application to market a product for an orphan-designated indication. However, PREA compliance may be required if approval is sought for other indications for which the drug has not received orphan designation.
The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP before approving an NDA. The FDA also will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the product is manufactured before the NDA is approved. The FDA will not approve the product unless current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also take into account results of inspections performed by certain counterpart foreign regulatory agencies in assessing compliance with GCP or cGMP. The FDA has entered into international agreements with foreign agencies, including the EMA, in order to facilitate this type of information sharing. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information.
Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and may take years to complete. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all.
29

We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary FDA approvals, which could delay or prevent us from marketing our products. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The advisory committee process may cause delays in the approval timeline. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully, particularly any negative recommendations or limitations, when making drug approval decisions.
The FDA may limit the indications for use, approve narrow labeling relegating a drug to second- line or later-line use, add limitations of use to the labeling or place other conditions on approvals, which could restrict the marketing of the products. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, which may themselves require further clinical testing, or changing the manufacturing process are subject to further FDA review and approval.
Post-approval requirements.
After FDA approval of a product is obtained, we are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements, including, among other things, establishment registration and product listing, record-keeping requirements, reporting certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, providing updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling. As a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require the applicant to conduct additional clinical trials or other post market testing and surveillance to further monitor and assess the drug’s safety and efficacy.
The FDA also has the authority to require a drug-specific risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to ensure the safe use of the drug. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The REMS strategy must be approved by the FDA. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the strategy’s approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on an approved drug if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians may prescribe a drug for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote the drug for the approved indications and in accordance with the approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations governing advertising and promotion can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, warning and untitled letters from the FDA, requests for corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Similarly, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, regulates the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical drugs, requiring passage of a pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the saleable unit level through the distribution system. The DSCSA added new sections in the FDCA that require manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, dispensers, and third-party logistics providers to take steps to identify and trace certain prescription drugs to protect against the threats of counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful drugs in the supply chain.  Among other mandates, the DSCSA requires manufacturers and repackagers to affix or imprint a unique product identifier (comprised of a standardized numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date of the product) on certain prescription drug packages in both a human-readable and on a machine-readable data carrier.  The standardized numerical identifier is comprised of the product’s corresponding National Drug Code combined with a unique alphanumeric serial number.  A drug product is misbranded if it does not bear the product identifier as required by Section 582 of the FFDC Act.  Section 582 also establishes several requirements relating to the verification of product identifiers. Implementation of the product identifier requirements has imposed and will continue to impose increased costs and administrative burdens and may lead to potential liability associated with the marketing and sale of drug products subject to these requirements. The DSCSA will become effective incrementally over a 10-year period, with serialization of prescription drug products distributed in the U.S. effective as of November 27, 2017 for drug manufacturers. The PDMA, DSCSA, and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
30

Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes certain procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product and product candidates. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing.
Once approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if issues bearing on the product’s safety or efficacy are discovered. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data or other information may also require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. New government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established that could delay or prevent FDA approval of our products under development or negatively impact the marketing of any future approved products.
Orphan drug designation.
We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nonsense mutation cystic fibrosis, or nmCF, nmDMD, nmMPS I, and nonsense mutation aniridia. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which is defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Orphan drug designation can provide opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and FDA user-fee benefits. In addition, if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. However, competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity. The FDA awarded an orphan drug designation to Emflaza for the treatment of patients with DMD and approved Emflaza on February 9, 2017 as the first corticosteroid approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with DMD, granting Emflaza orphan drug exclusivity for this disease as of the date of approval.
Hatch-Waxman exclusivity.
As we presently have no patent rights to protect the approved use of Emflaza, we rely on non-patent market exclusivity periods under the Orphan Drug Act and the Hatch-Waxman Act to commercialize Emflaza in the United States.
Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety. During the exclusivity period, the FDA generally may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
The FDCA also provides a shorter three-year period of market exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Three-year exclusivity may be granted for example, for new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity
31

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent market exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of market protection to the term of any existing Orange Book- listed patents or regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity periods described above. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study or studies in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study or studies within a specified timeframe prior to the expiration of the underlying patent or market exclusivity period to be extended. We have received such a request from the FDA and we intend to conduct such studies pending finalization of discussions with the FDA on the nature and objective of the required studies.
Regulation outside the United States
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. And, even if regulatory approval is granted, it may be withdrawn or limited under certain circumstances or post-approval requirements may be imposed by the applicable regulatory authority.
Regulation in the European Union
We have obtained an orphan medicinal product designation from the European Commission, following an evaluation by the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, Becker muscular dystrophy and aniridia - but have only received conditional marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. The European Commission can grant orphan medicinal product designation to products for which the sponsor can establish that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union, or (2) a life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would generate a sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. In addition, the sponsor must establish that there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation is not a marketing authorization. It is a designation that provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance, and the possibility to apply for a centralized EU marketing authorization, as well as 10 years of EU market exclusivity following a marketing authorization. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA, nor the European Commission nor any EU member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a “similar medicinal product.” A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In addition, a competing similar medicinal product may in limited circumstances be authorized prior to the expiration of the market exclusivity period, including if it is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to our product. Our product and product candidates can lose orphan designation, and the related benefits, prior to us obtaining a marketing authorization if it is demonstrated that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met.
Overview of application process.    To obtain regulatory approval of a drug under the European Union’s regulatory systems and authorization procedures, an applicant may submit marketing authorization applications under a centralized, decentralized, or national procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products, like Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, and medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, and optional for certain other innovative products. The centralized procedure enables applicants to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid in all EU member states based on a single application. Under the centralized procedure, the EMA’s Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, is required to adopt an opinion on a valid application within 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions. More specifically, on day 120 of the procedure, once the CHMP has received the preliminary assessment reports and opinions from the rapporteur and co-rapporteur, it prepares a list of potential outstanding issues, referred to as “other concerns” or “major objections”. These are sent to the applicant together with CHMP’s recommendation. The CHMP can make one of two recommendations: (1) the marketing authorization could be granted provided that satisfactory answers are given to the “other 
32

concerns” and/or “major objections” identified and that all conditions outlined in the list of outstanding issues are implemented and complied with; or (2) the product is not approvable since there are “major objections”.
Applicants have three months from the date of receiving the potential outstanding issues to respond to the CHMP, and can request a three-month extension if necessary. The granting of a marketing authorization will depend on the recommendations and potential major objections identified by the CHMP as well as the ability of the applicant to adequately respond to these findings. An accelerated assessment can be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. After the adoption of the CHMP opinion, a decision on the marketing authorization application must be adopted by the European Commission, after consulting the European Union member states, which in total can take more than 60 days.
An applicant for a marketing authorization application may request a re-examination in the event of a negative opinion, in connection with which CHMP appoints new rapporteurs. Within 60 days of receipt of the negative opinion, the applicant must submit a document explaining the basis for its request for re-examination. The CHMP has 60 days to consider the applicant’s request for re-examination. The applicant may request an oral explanation before the CHMP, which is routinely granted, following which CHMP will adopt a final opinion. The final opinion, whether positive or negative, is published by the CHMP shortly following the CHMP meeting at which the oral explanation takes place.
Conditional marketing authorizations.    In specific circumstances, as with Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, EU legislation enables applicants to obtain a marketing authorization on a conditional basis prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for products designated as orphan medicinal products, if (1) the benefit-risk balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs, and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the benefit-risk balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. The granting of a conditional marketing authorization will depend on the applicant’s ability to fulfill the conditions imposed within the agreed upon deadline.
For important information about matters that may adversely affect our ability to renew our conditional marketing authorization for Translarna, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Product and our Product Candidates” and “Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates.”
Variations to conditional marketing authorizations.    After the granting of a conditional marketing authorization, the marketing authorization holder may submit an application to vary the conditional marketing authorization under a variation procedure. In the case of the introduction of an additional therapeutic indication, the timeframe for the variation procedure for the initial assessment of the dossier is generally 90 days (plus up to 20 days for validation).
However, in the framework of a variation application assessment procedure, the EMA may send one or more requests for supplementary information to the marketing authorization holder, requiring that additional information be provided by the marketing authorization holder to support its variation application. Such supplementary requests will be sent together with a timetable stating the date by when the marketing authorization holder must submit the requested data and, where appropriate, the extended evaluation period to be applied to such variation procedure. The 90 day variation procedure may be suspended for up to three months for the marketing authorization holder to submit its responses to such supplementary requests. The marketing authorization holder will be notified of the outcome of the CHMP’s assessment of the variation procedure within 15 days from the adoption of the CHMP opinion. If unfavorable, the CHMP opinion may be subject to a re-examination procedure upon the marketing authorization holder’s request. This may imply an additional minimum two month procedure. If the CHMP opinion is favorable, the European Commission will usually vary the marketing authorization to introduce the additional therapeutic indication within approximately two months from the receipt of the final CHMP opinion.
Additional requirements and considerations.    Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver, or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. In the case of orphan medicinal products, completion of an approved PIP can result in an extension of the aforementioned market exclusivity period from ten to twelve years.
33

In the European Union, independently generated data submitted as part of a full marketing authorization application dossier are protected by regulatory data protection (‘data exclusivity’) for a period of eight years from the granting of a marketing authorization for a ‘reference product’. This means that for a period of eight years, competent authorities may not accept marketing authorization applications that rely on the independently generated data in the marketing authorization dossier of the reference product. Generic medicinal products that rely on the independently generated data of the reference product may not be placed on the market for 10 years from the granting of the initial marketing authorization for the reference medicinal product. These periods of data exclusivity and market exclusivity do not prevent other companies from obtaining a marketing authorization based on their own independently generated data.
If a marketing authorization is granted in the EEA for a medicinal product, such as the marketing authorization granted for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD by the European Commission, the marketing authorization holder is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal products that are in addition to the other conditions of the marketing authorization described above. The marketing authorization holder must, for example, comply with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post- authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. Other requirements relate to, for example, the manufacturing of products and active pharmaceutical ingredients in accordance with good manufacturing practice standards. Competent authorities of EU member states may conduct inspections to verify compliance with applicable requirements, and the marketing authorization holder will have to continue to expend time, money and effort to remain compliant. Non-compliance with EU requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties in the EU Similarly, failure to comply with the EU’s requirements regarding the protection of individual personal data can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. Individual EU member states may also impose various sanctions and penalties in case we do not comply with locally applicable requirements.
Off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. The applicable laws at European Union level and in the individual European Union member states also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the European Union could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict our promotional activities with health care professionals. In addition, legislation adopted at the European Union level and by individual European Union member states require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. Promotion of indications not covered by the SmPC is specifically prohibited.
The EMA is responsible for coordinating inspections to verify compliance with the principles of good clinical practice, or GCP, good manufacturing practice, or GMP, good laboratory practice, or GLP, and good pharmacovigilance practice, or GVP. These inspections are also intended to verify compliance with other aspects of the supervision of authorized medicinal products in use in the European Union. The EMA coordinates any inspection requested by the CHMP in connection with the assessment of marketing authorization applications or matters referred to these committees. Inspections may be routine or triggered by issues arising during the assessment of the dossier or by other information, such as previous inspection experience. Inspections usually are requested during the initial review of a marketing authorization application, but could arise post-authorization.
Inspectors are drawn from member states of the European Union and the European Economic Area. Following an inspection, the inspectors provide a written inspection report to the inspected site or applicant and provide an opportunity for response. Some inspection reports require follow-up and may result in additional adverse consequences due to critical or major findings. The inspectors and the CHMP will comment on any response from an inspected site or applicant and may monitor future compliance with any proposed corrective action plan.
In the GCP area, inspectors grade their findings according to the following scale:

• | Critical: Conditions, practices or processes that adversely affect the rights, safety or well-being of the subjects or the quality and integrity of data. Observations classified as critical may include a pattern of deviations classified as major.


• | Major: Conditions, practices or processes that might adversely affect the rights, safety or well-being of the subjects and/or the quality and integrity of data. Observations classified as major may include a pattern of deviations or numerous minor observations.


• | Minor: Conditions, practices or processes that would not be expected to adversely affect the rights, safety or wellbeing of the subjects or the quality and integrity of data. Minor observations indicate the need for improvement of conditions, practices and processes.

34


• | Comments: Suggestions on how to improve quality or reduce the potential for a deviation to occur in the future.

Possible consequences of critical and major findings include rejection of clinical trial data, causing significant delays in obtaining final marketing authorization, or other direct action by national regulatory authorities.
Early access programs
Many jurisdictions allow the supply of unauthorized medicinal products in the context of strictly regulated and exceptional EAP programs, and some countries may provide reimbursement for drugs provided in the context of such programs. In the European Union, the legal basis for EAP programs, also referred to as named-patient and compassionate use programs, is set out in the EU legislation regulating the authorization, manufacture, distribution and marketing of medicinal products. Detailed regulatory requirements applicable to EAP programs have been adopted and implemented by EU member states in their national laws. The promotion, advertising and marketing of unauthorized medicinal products is generally prohibited, and authorization for EAP programs must generally be obtained from national competent authorities, which might not grant such authorization. Obtaining authorization for an EAP program in one country does not ensure that authorization will be obtained in another country. U.S. law permits “expanded access” (also known as compassionate use and treatment use) for certain patients with serious diseases who have no comparable alternative treatment options. To provide expanded access, sponsors must submit detailed regulatory information to the FDA. FDA authorization depends on several different factors, including whether expanded access will interfere with related clinical trials or drug development. Sponsors may not promote products as safe or effective for expanded-access uses.
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of pharmaceuticals have been a focus of this effort. Foreign governments, the U.S. government, and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.
In some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing and reimbursement negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. In some countries, governments can set conditions that must be satisfied for prices to be set at a certain value. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing and reimbursement negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states, and parallel distribution (arbitrage between low-priced and high- priced member states), can further reduce prices. In some countries we may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product or product candidate to other available therapies in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval.
Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. For example in the United States, healthcare reform measures under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, referred to together as the Affordable Care Act, contain provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products. However, the Trump Administration and Congress already attempted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and may do so again, which may contribute to the uncertainty of the ongoing implementation and impact of the Affordable Care Act and also underscores the potential for additional reform going forward. Certain provisions of enacted or proposed legislative changes may negatively impact coverage and reimbursement of healthcare items and services. We cannot assure that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.
Any regulatory approval of a product is limited to specific diseases and indications for which such product has been deemed safe and effective by the FDA. Coverage by federal healthcare programs, however, may be more limited than the indications for which a drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities’ coverage of the same products. Sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered and reimbursed by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs (such as, in the United States, Medicare and Medicaid), private health insurers and other organizations. Obtaining reimbursement for orphan drugs may be particularly difficult because of the significant research and development challenges and costs and resulting pricing considerations typically associated with drugs developed to treat conditions that affect a small population of patients. In addition, third-party payors are likely to impose strict requirements for reimbursement in connection with drugs that 
35

are perceived as having high costs. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors.
The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third- party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our product or product candidates or conduct direct head-to-head studies to demonstrate clinical superiority and cost-effectiveness. Our products and product candidates may not be considered clinically superior and cost-effective to competitor products.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement.
For important information regarding certain pricing and reimbursement matters see “Item 1. Business-Market Access Considerations” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor titled “Commercialization of Translarna has been in, and is expected to continue to take place in, countries that tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues. Failure to obtain and maintain acceptable pricing and reimbursement terms for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA and other countries where Translarna is available would delay or prevent us from marketing our product in such regions, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”
Freedom of Information Requests and Affirmative Disclosures
We are also subject, in the U.S. and many other countries, to various regulatory schemes that require disclosure of clinical trial data or allow access to our data via freedom of information requests. We have been and may, from time to time, be notified by regulators, such as the EMA or the competent authorities of EU member states that they have received a freedom of information request for documents that they hold relating to our company, including information related to our product or our product candidates. For example, in 2015, we were notified by the EMA that it had received from another pharmaceutical company a request under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 seeking access to aspects of our marketing authorization application for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Following the decision of the EMA to release such documentation with only minimal redactions we initiated litigation before the General Court of the European Union to prevent disclosure of this information. In the first quarter of 2018, the Court ruled in favor of the EMA, allowing the EMA to release the documentation. We have appealed the General Court’s decision to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the EMA has confirmed that it will not release the documents while the matter is still subject to the appeal process. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the appeal and we may not ultimately succeed in preventing disclosure of the data in our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. In addition, under policies recently adopted in the EU, clinical trial data submitted to the EMA in MAAs that were traditionally regarded as confidential commercial information is now subject to automatic public disclosure. Subject to our limited ability to review and redact a narrow sub-set of confidential commercial information, these new EU policies will result in the EMA’s public disclosure of certain of our clinical study reports, clinical trial data summaries and clinical overviews for recently completed and future MAA submissions. The move toward public disclosure of development data could adversely affect our business in many ways, including, for example, resulting in the disclosure of our confidential methodologies for development of our products, preventing us from obtaining intellectual property right protection for innovations, requiring us to allocate significant resources to prevent other companies from violating our intellectual property rights, adding even more complexity to processing health data from clinical trials consistent with applicable data privacy regulations, and enabling competitors to use our data to gain approvals for their own products.
Fraud and Abuse Laws
Any present or future arrangements or interactions with third-party payors, healthcare providers and professionals, patients and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may restrict certain marketing and contracting practices. These laws include, and are not limited to, anti-kickback and false claims statutes.
Both the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and the UK Bribery Act of 2010, or Bribery Act are broad in scope and will require companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA prohibits the offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to improperly influence any act or decision, secure any other improper advantage, or obtain or retain business. Under the UK Bribery Act, companies which carry on a business or part of a business in the United Kingdom may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person, including non-UK government officials and private persons, by employees and persons associated with the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the 
36

company. Similar statutes have been adopted, or may be adopted in the future, by other countries in which we operate and with which we are or may be required to comply.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, or order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute imposes criminal penalties and has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others. Although a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors exist to protect certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors for this statute are narrow, and practices that involve compensation intended to induce prescriptions, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not always meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection. A person or entity need not have knowledge of the statutes or the specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs; furthermore, in several states, these statutes and regulations apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer’s product from reimbursement under government programs, debarment, criminal fines, and imprisonment. Several other countries, including the United Kingdom, have enacted similar anti-kickback, fraud and abuse laws and regulations.
The federal False Claims Act, which permits civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, imposes civil liability and penalties on individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, as well as for making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The federal government continues to use the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in investigations against pharmaceutical and health care companies. These investigations have involved, for example, allegations of providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the free product, as well as the promotion of products for unapproved uses. Potential liability under the federal False Claims Act includes treble damages and significant per claim penalties, currently set at $10,957 to $21,916 (as adjusted for inflation) per false claim. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
The Affordable Care Act included a provision requiring certain providers and suppliers of items and services to Federal Health Care Programs to report and return overpayments within sixty days after they are “identified” (the “Overpayment Statute”). In 2014 and 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, released regulatory guidance (in the form of a final rule) to Medicare providers, suppliers and managed care and prescription drug plans regarding how to comply with the Overpayment Statute. Although these Medicare providers, suppliers and plans have faced federal False Claims Act liability since 2010 for failures to comply with the Overpayment Statute, these final rules interpreting the Overpayment Statute provide guidance regarding how to comply with applicable obligations, and guidance to government regulators and enforcement authorities regarding monitoring and prosecuting suspected violations. These final rules are not directly applicable to manufacturers, but may impact their customers and potential customers who are Medicare providers, suppliers, and plans.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value made to covered recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests. Payments made to physicians and certain research institutions for clinical trials are included within the ambit of this law. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required annually to report and disclose payments and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Such information is made publicly available by CMS in a searchable format, with data collected in each calendar year published the following June. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties, with increased penalties for “knowing failures,” for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. If not preempted by this federal law, several states currently require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to healthcare professionals in those states. Depending on the state, legislation may prohibit various other marketing related activities, or require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, certain states, such as California, Nevada, Connecticut and Massachusetts, require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes and several other states are considering similar proposals. Manufacturers that fail to comply with these state laws can face civil penalties.
37

Statutory requirements to disclose publicly payments made to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations have also been enacted in certain European Union member states. In addition, self-regulatory bodies of the pharmaceuticals industry, such as the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, or EFPIA, have published codes of conduct to which its members have agreed to abide to, that require the public disclosure of payments made to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, imposes criminal liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and for knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
HIPAA, HITECH, and similar state laws, also impose obligations on certain entities with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity.
