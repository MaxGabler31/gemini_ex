ITEM 1. BUSINESSBusiness Overview
Leatt designs, develops, markets and distributes personal protective equipment for participants in all forms of motor sports and leisure activities, including riders of motorcycles, bicycles, snowmobiles and ATVs. The Company sells its products to customers worldwide through a global network of distributors and retailers. Leatt also acts as the original equipment manufacturer for neck braces sold by other international brands. 
 The Companys flagship products are based on the Leatt-Brace® system, a patented injection molded neck protection system owned by Xceed Holdings, designed to prevent potentially devastating injuries to the cervical spine and neck. The Company has the exclusive global manufacturing, distribution, sale and use rights to the Leatt-Brace®, pursuant to a license agreement between the Company and Xceed Holdings, a company owned and controlled by the Companys Chairman and founder, Dr. Christopher Leatt. The Company also has the right to use apparatus embodying, employing and containing the Leatt-Brace® technology and has designed, developed, marketed and distributed other personal protective equipment using this technology, as well as its own developed technology, including the Companys expanding range of body protection and helmet products which it markets under the Leatt Protection Range brand. In 2015 the Company initially launched the first products in its new helmet range and continues to establish its offerings within this product range. The Company believes that the new helmet range redefines head and brain protection with its groundbreaking 360-degree Turbine technology for concussion and brain rotation safety. These helmets offer superior head and brain protection in a shell that is smaller, very lightweight and super ventilated, even at low speeds. 
 The Companys research and development efforts are conducted at its research facilities, located at its executive headquarters in Cape Town, South Africa. The Company employs 4 full-time employees who are dedicated exclusively to research, development, and testing. The Company also utilizes consultants, academic institutions and engineering companies as independent contractors or consultants, from time to time, to assist it with its research and development efforts. Leatt products have been tested and reviewed internally and by external bodies. All Leatt products are compliant with applicable European Union directives, or CE certified, where appropriate. Certain products, such as the Moto GPX was tested by BMW Motorrad (Germany) and reviewed by KTM (Austria).
 Our products are manufactured in China under outsource manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers located there. The Company utilizes outside consultants and its own employees to ensure the quality of its products through regular on-site product inspections. Products purchased through international sales are usually shipped directly from our consolidation warehouse or manufacturers warehouses to customers or their import agents. 
 Leatt earns revenues through the sale of its products through approximately 100 distributors worldwide, who in turn sell its products to retailers. Leatt distributors are required to follow certain standard business terms and guidelines for the sale and distribution of Leatt products. Two Eleven and Leatt SA directly distribute Leatt products to retailers in the United States and South Africa, respectively.

Our Industry and Market Trends 
 Off-Road Motorcycle Market
Our products have their roots in the off-road motorcycle market. Our revolutionary neck brace was invented by Dr. Leatt to protect from catastrophic neck injuries after he witnessed the death of a fellow off-road motorcycle rider the weekend after his sons riding debut. As a result, our original products target participants in off-road cycling activities such as BMX racing and downhill racing.
 We believe that we have gained our market share, largely due to the innovation and quality of our products, the growth of the market, our increased marketing efforts and our steps to secure our international patents and protect our patents from infringement. 
 Downhill and Cycling Market 
 We design and sell neck braces, helmets and protective gear for the downhill and cycling market. We entered this market focusing on downhill cycling, which requires a full-face helmet. We have since expanded our protective gear range to address the needs of mountain biking and BMX riders. The downhill and cycling market is now our second largest market.
 Other Recreational Markets
We also design and sell neck braces for use by participants in other recreational sports such as ATV, go-kart, snowmobile users and participants in other sports where a full-face helmet should be worn. As a result, our overall performance in the market is also affected by the performance of these industries, especially in jurisdictions where the use of helmets is compulsory. 
Our Products 
 The Company designs, develops, distributes and markets protective gear, parts and accessories. The company's flagship protective product is the Leatt-Brace®, a patented neck protection system for sports.

The Leatt-Brace®
The Leatt-Brace® is a prophylactic neck bracing system composed of various combinations of carbon fiber, glass fiber, polycarbonate or Glass Filled Nylon, which was designed to help prevent potentially devastating sports injuries to the cervical spine (neck). The first LeattBrace® was designed for motorcycle, high speed motor vehicle and ATV use, where there is little means of protecting the neck in the event of an accident, but the Leatt-Brace® has been designed in such a way as to offer neck protection to all who utilize a crash helmet as a form of protection, including soldiers, law enforcement officers and other professionals whose activities could result in cervical spine injury. 
 The Company currently markets and sells seven models of Leatt-Brace® products which bring the safety benefits of the Leatt-Brace® technology to a large group of sports participants: our GPX model for off- road motorcycle use; our DBX model, for downhill and BMX bicycle use; our SNX model for snowmobile use; our STX model for adventure riders, street commuters and Speedway participants; our Kart model for go karting; and our Fusion model which incorporates the neck brace with body protection. 
 The GPX models include the GPX 5.5, which is fully adjustable, the GPX 4.5, which is less adjustable, the GPX 6.5, which is a full carbon brace and the new award-winning GPX 3.5 neck brace, which is competitively priced. Our DBX models include the DBX 5.5, which is fully adjustable, the DBX 6.5 which is a full carbon brace and the new award-winning GPX 3.5 neck brace, which is competitively priced. Both the GPX and DBX ranges feature a 5.5 Junior and 3.5 Junior neck brace designed for young athletes. The STX models include the STX RR and STX Road, while the SNX model includes the SNX 5.5 and SNX Trophy, and the Fusion models include 3.0 version designed for adults and 2.0 version designed for young athletes. The Company offers various versions and colors of these products to appeal to different clients and price points.

To be eligible for the 2018 award, products had to be new or substantially improved from previous years and be ready for delivery in calendar year 2018. 

 We believe that the quality of Leatt-Brace® products has resulted in increased sales since inception. We have sold in excess of 710,000 units of Leatt-Brace® products worldwide to date. Approximately 9% of our 2010-unit sales were from our DBX bicycle brace. This number increased to 10% of unit sales in 2014, and to 13% of unit sales in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Our STX street brace, which was introduced to the market in 2011, accounted for as much as 2% of unit sales in 2015, and has remained constant at 1% of unit sales in 2016 and 2017. 
 Manufacturing 
 Our products are manufactured in China in accordance with our manufacturing specifications, pursuant to outsourced manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers located there. Our third-party manufacturers usually have the capacity to produce more than 120,000 neck braces per year and have the space to expand such capacity as required. We do not currently have written agreements with our neck brace third-party manufacturers but will include any such future written agreement with our periodic filings. We have a manufacturing agreement with our Helmet manufacturer and will file agreements as they become material. We generally offer a 2-year warranty on our products in accordance with EU regulations. Products purchased through international sales are usually shipped directly from our consolidation warehouse or manufacturers warehouses to customers or their import agents. 
 Upon our determination of order quantities, we issue periodic purchase orders for products to our third-party manufacturers at negotiated prices. A security deposit of between 10  30% of the total purchase order value is made with such manufacturers upon receipt of a manufacturers invoice reflecting quantities ordered and the negotiated price for the products. The standard lead time from purchase order date to ship-ready date is 70 days, and our usually agreed on shipping terms are FOB (Port).
 During production, we measure the manufacturers on-time performance to determine whether to continue our relationship. We utilize outside consultants and our own employees to ensure the quality of our products through regular on-site product inspections. Such quality inspections are conducted in conformance with ISO/IEC 17025 specifications at the manufacturers premises and penalties are levied against a manufacturer if any delay in shipment to customers or customer rejection or non-acceptance is caused by quality issues. The balance of the open invoices is paid to the manufacturer four six weeks after successful inspection.

Raw Materials and Suppliers 
 Our products are manufactured from generally available engineering materials, such as thermoset carbon fiber, glass fiber reinforced nylon and high impact polycarbonate resin. The cost of materials used in our products varies depending on the target market for, and the price of, our products. The prices of these raw materials are determined based upon prevailing market conditions, supply and demand and global conditions may impact the supply of these raw materials and adversely affect the supply of our products. We have not experienced any interruptions to our production due to shortage of our raw materials. 
 Our third-party manufacturers arrange for the purchase of most of the raw materials that are used to manufacture our products and they pay for the cost of such materials. We may occasionally directly source and pay for highly specialized protection materials, for use in the production of our products. These protection materials are generally available. We may also occasionally acquire raw materials on behalf of a third-party manufacturer in order to secure and maintain a specified production capacity. The expenses incurred for such materials for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were not material and we do not foresee these amounts being material in the near future. 
 We have implemented certain protocols to check the quality of raw materials used in the production process. Our third-party manufacturers are required to perform prescribed strength testing on critical parts of certain products. In addition, certain materials are tested by our research and development staff at Leatt SA and by independent material laboratories for compliance to manufacturing and material specification. 
 Our Customers
 Leatt earns revenues through the sale of its products to customers worldwide through a global network of distributors and retailers. Leatt also acts as the original equipment manufacturer for neck braces sold by certain international brands. Leatt sells its products directly to distributors in South Africa (through Leatt SA), in the USA (through Two Eleven), and through a network of approximately 100 third-party distributors worldwide. Our distributors are required to follow certain standard business terms and guidelines for the sale and distribution of our products. Two Eleven also sells our products directly to consumers through our online store available at www.leatt.com. 
 Products purchased through international sales are usually shipped directly from our consolidation warehouse or manufacturers warehouses to customers or their import agents. Revenue and related cost of revenue is recognized at the time of shipment from the manufacturers port when shipping terms are Free on Board (FOB) shipping point, Cost and Freight (CFR) or Cost and Insurance to named place (CIP) as legal title and risk of loss to the product pass to the customer. 
 We generate revenue both in the United States and internationally. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, annual revenues associated with international customers were $12,827,572 and $9,685,191, or 64% and 59% of total revenue, respectively. 
 We have derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers, however none of our customers account for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our largest customer accounted for approximately 10% and 13% of our annual U.S. revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $147,711 or 6% and $316,976 or 14% of our accounts receivable was due from this customer. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our international revenue derived outside of the U.S. was earned from one customer that accounted for approximately 8% and 9% of our annual international revenue for the respective periods. As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, $0 and $24,394, or 0% and 1% of our accounts receivable, respectively, was due from this international customer. 
 Advertising and Marketing
We first gained market recognition through customer word-of-mouth and later through third-party articles and reviews of the Leatt-Brace® in motorcycle and racing magazines, and unsolicited and unpaid endorsements from current and former celebrity motocross (and other) riders, but we now advertise our products in various motorsport industry magazines and in related online media. We also enhance our image through the sponsorship of sporting events, teams and individuals. 
 We believe that, as a result of our marketing efforts, and based on our internal marketing estimates, we have approximately 830 active distributors and dealers who stock Leatt products in the U. S. and approximately 211 active distributors and dealers in South Africa. We expect that the number of our distributors and dealers will also grow as the market segments that we sell to and our product offering grows but we cannot guarantee that this will be the case. 
 - 30 - 

Our advertising and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $1,690,408 and $1,588,599, respectively, representing approximately 8% and 10% of our revenues for each period. 
 Our Growth Strategy 
 We are committed to growing our business in the coming years. The key elements of our growth strategy are summarized below: 
 
 | Regional Distribution. Our product range has attracted the interest of global retailers and distributors of protective gear for motor and extreme sports, as well as automotive and motorcycle manufacturers and racing teams like the KTM teams. The resultant interest and the expected demand for our products have prompted us to change our production and distribution strategy in order to cater to this demand. In November 2007, we established Two Eleven, our wholly owned California subsidiary, to manage and control the distribution of our products, particularly in the United States. We distribute products to international consumers through a network of international distributors who are selected by our management team based on their financial status and creditworthiness, their location in major geographic locations, their marketing and media presence, their portfolio of leading motorcycle brands and accessories, and their reputation among industry players. We are working on developing our bicycle distribution network throughout the world by appointing new distributors and dealers with a specific focus on the bicycle market. We believe that regional distributors will better promote our products in the designated regions and expand our global customer base. In the U.S we are expanding and upgrading our dealer network and sales management team. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Strategic Alliances. We are actively researching and evaluating strategic alliances that will enable the Company to grow into markets outside of its core markets in an efficient manner. We are also working with our OEM partners to develop more mutually beneficial, sustainable, long-term relationships in line with the Companys goals. 
 | Industry Accreditation and Endorsements. We are pursuing accreditation and endorsements of our products from global motor sports governing bodies and industry organizations. We are in discussions with governing racing bodies, such as the Commission Internationale de Karting, or CIK, to have the Leatt-Brace® accredited. We believe that these accreditations and endorsements will increase sales of our products and solidify our position as a leader in safety products. SFI testing is compulsory for neck protection used in automotive racing in the United States, therefore should neck protection be compulsory we believe that such accreditations and endorsements will additionally increase our sales. 
 | Developing Brand Awareness and Brand Loyalty. We are continuing with our efforts to develop brand loyalty by refining our marketing strategy and by engaging in more targeted communication with current and potential consumers of our products. We are working to build loyalty among more consumers in our core bicycle and moto markets by introducing more price points for our products and addressing more consumer needs in more segments, while remaining true to our missionpioneering functional safety gear. 
 | Expanding our Portfolio of Products. We are always looking for opportunities to introduce new products to reach a wider audience and penetrate new markets. This will include extending our product range to include both innovative protection products as well as peripheral or accessory products such as clothing. In the 2015 first quarter our Knee Brace was accepted for registration by both the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UKs Medicine and Healthcare Regulatory Products Agency (MHRA), and our Shoulder Brace was accepted by the FDA, as Class 1 Medical Devices. FDA and MHRA registration will allow us to take these products directly to market as medical devices for patients (not just athletes) recuperating from injuries, surgery, muscle tears or strains, dislocations, breaks or fractures. In 2016, we launched two additions to our body armor product range, namely helmets and gloves. We also added two full apparel lines to our product rangeone line designed for the off-road motorcycle market and the other designed for the bicycling market. We expect that our sales of peripheral products and accessories will increase in line with increased brand awareness. 

 Our Research and Development Efforts
Our Chairman and Founder, Dr. Christopher Leatt, is our primary research and development consultant and heads the research and development efforts conducted at our research facility, or Leatt Lab, located at our executive headquarters in Cape Town, South Africa. The facility houses a team of biomedical engineers and designers who ensure products are scientifically and mechanically sound. This facility features state of the art testing and prototyping equipment and sophisticated simulation models. Leatt also utilizes other consultants, academic institutions and engineering companies from time to time to assist us with our research and development efforts. 
 - 31 - 

We believe that the development of new products and new technology is critical to our success. We are continuously working to improve the quality, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of our existing products. All our products have achieved CE certification when necessary. We are working to develop technology to expand our range of products with further innovation, comfort, ergonomics and market appeal. We believe that our scientific and medical approach to product development gives our products a competitive edge. 
 Our research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, amounted to $1,358,512 and $1,443,451, respectively. These expenses included salaries for research and development staff as well as other direct product development and research costs. 
 Competition
We compete with a small number of dominant competitors in the neck brace and body protection market, some of whom have substantially greater financial and other resources than we currently have. According to the RacerX survey discussed elsewhere herein and available at http://mediakit.filterpubs.com/survey, our major competitors in the neck brace market is Atlas Brace USA, LLC, Alpinestars S.p.A and EVS Sports, our major competitor in the knee brace market is EVS Sports; and our major competitors in the body protection, apparel and helmet market is Fox Racing.
 Competition is based on quality, price reputation, industry endorsements and certifications, as well as, on product design, brand names, marketing support and distribution strategies. We believe that our products can be distinguished from the products offered by our competitors due to the fact that our products are innovative, safety tested, versatile, aesthetically appealing, priced competitively and comfortable without compromising quality and performance. 
 Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that our competitive strengths include the following: 
 
 | Intellectual Property. Licensed patented technology allows us to provide a product that cannot easily be duplicated by our competitors. We have invested extensive resources to patent our products worldwide and have taken legal action to protect our intellectual property rights from infringement. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Diverse Multi-Cultural Skilled Management Team. Our management team is knowledgeable and experienced in the personal protective equipment industry, sports medicine and business development. Our executive corporate management team consists of Mr. Sean Macdonald, Dr. Christopher Leatt, Mr. Erik Olsson and Mr. Todd Repsher. Mr. Macdonald is our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President and Director, and is a Chartered Accountant with 14 years experience in the financial and operational aspects of running sports orientated growth companies. Dr. Leatt is our Founder, Chairman and Research and Development consultant, who developed the Leatt- Brace® from his study of the benefits and viability of a neck protection system for helmet clad sport and recreational users. Mr. Olsson is our General Manager and Head of International Distribution and has served as a Sales and Product Manager for various companies in the power sports industry. Mr. Olsson has over 20 years experience as a sales and product manager for various companies in the power sports industry. Mr. Repsher is our US General Manager, who is an award-winning sales executive with over 15 years experience in the marketing and sales of sports orientated companies in North America. 
 | Outsourced Manufacturing. We outsource our manufacturing to third-party manufacturers in order to produce large volumes of our products. The manufacturing process remains subject to our strict quality control guidelines safeguarded by our employees and the third-party inspectors who we hire as consultants to ensure that these guidelines are being implemented at the production point. While such manufacturing arrangements pose a risk to our ability to safeguard our property technologies and may lead to increased costs, as discussed under the Risk Factors heading in this report, we expect that the increase in expected sales volumes will contribute to a lower production cost per unit and that this will translate to better margins for our distributors and retailers. 
 | Research, Development, Certification and Marketing Capabilities. We have in-house know how in the areas of product development, testing and accreditation, particularly in the field of personal protective equipment. With the experience and capabilities developed and established in taking our product to market, we believe that we are well positioned to develop, manufacture and market additional products. With our medical and mechanical expertise, demonstrated research and development capabilities, established outsource manufacturing capacity, established brand and our dedicated, loyal and enthusiastic distribution network, we believe that we have the components necessary to bring new successful products to market. 

 - 32 - 


 | Industry Accreditation, Testing Standards and Regulations. We are pursuing accreditation and endorsements of our products from global motor sports governing bodies and industry organizations. We have obtained homologations of our products from various global racing authorities where objective standards have been set and we are in discussions with governing racing bodies, such as the CIK, to have the Leatt-Brace® accredited. SFI testing is compulsory for neck protection used in automotive racing in the U. S., therefore any of our competitors will also have to pass the certification testing. Should industry accreditation become compulsory, we would be ahead of our competitors in the market place. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Brand Recognition. We believe that public recognition of the Leatt® brand drives the sales of our products, regardless of the action of competitors and competitive products. We expect that the reputation of our brand in the market place, particularly our product testing and applicable CE certification, will continue to ensure market acceptance and facilitate market penetration of our new products. In order to bolster and grow the Leatt® brand, stringent quality control and assurance are our highest priority and our ongoing marketing, advertising and public relations efforts continue to stress the quality, safety and innovation of our products. 

Our Intellectual Property 
 We believe that the continued success of our business is dependent on our intellectual property portfolio consisting of globally registered trademarks, design patents and utility patents related to the Leatt-Brace®. Most of these initial intellectual property rights are held by Xceed Holdings, a corporation controlled by our Chairman, Dr. Christopher Leatt and the rest of these rights are held by the Company and Three Eleven Distribution, our South African subsidiary. We license most of our intellectual property from Xceed Holdings, pursuant to a patent and royalty license agreement, or Licensing Agreement, dated March 1, 2006, between the Company and Xceed Holdings. Under the terms of the Licensing Agreement, we are obligated to pay Xceed Holdings 4% of all our revenues billed and recieved from the Leatt-Brace®. In addition, pursuant to a separate license agreement between us and Mr. De Villiers, we are obligated to pay a royalty fee of 1% of all our billed and received sales revenue, in quarterly installments, based on sales of the previous quarter, to a trust that is beneficially owned and controlled by Mr. De Villiers. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we have taken may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our technology. 
 The following table lists the patents and designs licensed from Xceed Holdings:

____________________ 
* The Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, is an international agreement for filing patent applications having effect in up to 117 countries. Under the PCT, an inventor can file a single international patent application in one language with one patent office in order to simultaneously seek protection for an invention in up to 117 countries throughout the world. 
 Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Issued patents or patents based on pending patent applications or any future patent applications may not exclude competitors or may not provide a competitive advantage to us. In addition, patents issued or licensed to us may not be held valid if subsequently challenged and others may claim rights in or ownership of such patents. In addition, the validity and breadth of claims in protective gear technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, the extent of their enforceability and protection is highly uncertain.

____________________ 
* A Community Trade Mark or CTM, is any trademark which is pending registration or has been registered in the European Union as a whole (rather than on a national level within the EU). The CTM system creates a unified trademark registration system in Europe, whereby one registration provides protection by being enforceable in all member states of the EU. 
 ____________________ 
 From time to time, we have had to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation and we may be required to do so in the future. Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without paying us. We cannot assure you that our competitors have not developed or will not develop similar products, will not duplicate our products, or will not design around any patents issued to or licensed by us. We believe that a loss of these rights would harm or cause a material disruption to our business and, our corporate strategy is to aggressively take legal action against any violators of our intellectual property rights, regardless of where they may be. 
 Our Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 51 full-time employees, 9 independent contractors and no part-time employees. The following table sets forth the number of our full-time employees by function as of December 31, 2017.

 We are required to pay UIF, or unemployment insurance, for each of our South African employees. We are also required to withhold income taxes for our South African and U.S. based employees. We generally provide health care benefits and other standard benefits to our employees. We do not have any pension or retirement plans for any of our employees. 
 We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees and we have not experienced any significant labor disputes or any difficulty in recruiting staff for our operations. 
 Regulations
The 2012 JOBS Act
We qualify as an emerging growth company, as defined in Title I of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company is defined as an issuer, including a foreign private issuer, with less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during the most recently completed fiscal year. The SEC has interpreted total annual gross revenues to mean total revenues as presented on the income statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, which for the Company was $16.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. We will retain our status as an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the fifth anniversary of the date we first sell securities pursuant to an IPO registration statement; (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we first exceed $1 billion in annual gross revenues; (3) the time we become a large accelerated filer (an SEC registered company with a public float of at least $700 million); or (4) the date on which we have issued, within the previous three years, $1 billion of nonconvertible debt, whether issued in a registered or unregistered offering and whether or not it is still outstanding at the determination date. 
 - 38 - 

The JOBS Act provides scaled disclosure provisions for us, including, among other things: (a) permitting us to include only two years of audited financial statements in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 for an IPO of common equity securities; (b) allowing us to comply with the smaller reporting company version of Item 402 of Regulation S-K (Executive Compensation); and (c) removing the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The JOBS Act also exempts us from the following additional compensation-related disclosure provisions that were imposed on U.S. public companies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act: the advisory say-on-pay vote on executive compensation required under Section 14A(a) of the Exchange Act; the Section 14A(b) requirements relating to shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation; the Section 14(i) requirements for disclosure relating to the relationship between executive compensation and financial performance of the issuer; and the requirement of Dodd-Frank Act Section 953(b)(1), which will require disclosure as to the relationship between CEO and median employee pay. 
 Under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act, "emerging growth companies" can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period for compliance with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies. 
 European Union Directives
All our products are compliant with applicable European Union directives, or CE certified, where appropriate. All Leatt Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) products are CE Certified showing compliance with European Economic Community (EEC) directive 89/686/EEC that imposes mandatory accreditation of all Personal Protective Equipment products offered for sale in the EEC. This includes the Companys Leatt-Brace® and body protection products. 
 This means that as a minimum these products must comply with: the basic Health and Safety requirements of the directive; certain chemical innocuousness tests prescribed in EN 340:2003 - Protective clothing  General Requirements; and the requirements relating to usage, care, cleaning, sizing and other information to be supplied with the product. Accordingly, all Leatt-Braces®, chest protectors and body protection products are CE certified. Only our peripheral products such as jackets, clothing, and caps are not covered. 
 In addition to the minimum requirements the Company complies with the European Standards, or EN (European Norm), specific to certain categories of PPE. An EN is a standard that has been adopted by one of the three recognized European Standardization Organizations (ESOs): CEN, CENELEC or ETSI. It is produced by all interested parties (including manufacturers, users, consumers and regulators of a particular material, product, process or service) through a transparent, open and consensus-based process. In the Companys case these are the applicable EN standards: EN 14021 Stone Shields; EN 1621-1 Limb Protectors; EN 1621-2 Back Protectors; and CE EN1621-3 level 2 impact front Chest Protectors. These standards are more performance related and, among other things, measure the performance of PPE at various intensity levels and under different environmental conditions. They also prescribe product labeling, tests for user comfort and ease of use. Where no specific standards exist in the EU, such as with the neck brace, the Notifying Body will be responsible for CE evaluation and certification. 
 FDA and MHRA Registration
In the 2015 first quarter our Knee Brace was accepted for registration by both the FDA and the MHRA, and our Shoulder Brace was accepted by the FDA, as Class 1 Medical Devices. FDA and MHRA registration will allow us take these products directly to market as medical devices for patients (not just athletes) recuperating from injuries, surgery, muscle tears or strains, dislocations, breaks or fractures. The Companys FDA registration included the contract manufacturer of the braces, a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) vendor. For the registration period, which currently expires in December 31, 2018, we will be required to maintain logs of complaints or problems, and to provide appropriate labeling for medical uses. We have renewed our registration until December 31, 2018. The MHRA registration of the knee brace is open-ended, subject to the Companys continued monitoring of product performance in the market place and delivery of prompt responses to the MHRA as necessary. 
 Other Accreditation 
 We have also obtained certification for certain of our products, such as the MRX head and neck restraint system, by the SFI Foundation (USA), or the SFI. To attain SFI certification, a safety device must, every five years, pass a series of impact sled tests with an instrumented crash test dummy at a SFI accredited test lab, as well as flammability tests on various parts of the safety device. These tests are done according to the SFI38.1 specification that can be found at http://www.sfifoundation.com. SFI 38.1 accreditation is mandatory for any safety device that is used by participants in SFI sanctioned events worldwide. We also voluntarily submitted our Moto GPX neck brace to be tested by the in-house engineers of BMW Motorrad (Germany) and to be reviewed by KTM (Austria). We believe that such testing, while not mandatory, provides validation for our products performance.
