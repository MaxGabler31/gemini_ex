Item 1. BUSINESS
Our Business 
 
Starco Brands, Inc. (formerly Insynergy Products, Inc.) (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 26, 2010, to engage in Direct Response marketing of consumer products with the goal of producing sales through television and/or retail. On September 7, 2017 the Company filed an Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to change the corporate name to Starco Brands, Inc. The Board determined the change of the Companys name was in the best interests of the Company due to changes in our current and anticipated business operations. In July 2017 the Company entered into a licensing agreement with The Starco Group, located in Los Angeles, California. The Company intends to focus our marketing efforts on certain novel consumer products manufactured by The Starco Group. The Starco Group is predominantly an aerosol and liquid fill private label manufacturer which manufactures DIY/Hardware, paints, coatings and adhesives, household, air care, disinfectants, automotive, motorcycle, arts & crafts, personal care cosmetics, personal care FDA, sun care, food, cooking oils, beverage, spirits and wine.

Executive Overview
 
In 2016, Insynergy Products, Inc. now Starco Brands, Inc. (the Company) abandoned the business plan of marketing consumer products through television distributed infomercials. In July 2017, our Board of Directors entered into a licensing agreement with The Starco Group, located in Los Angeles, California, to pursue a new strategic marketing plan involving commercializing leading edge products with the intent to sell them through brick and mortar retailers as well as through online retailers. Management believes the Company will realize modest earnings from royalties in the short term with a stronger positive outlook over the next 24 months. 
 
Starco Brands, Inc. is now a company whose mission is to create behavior-changing products and brands. Our core competency is inventing brands, marketing, building trends, pushing awareness and social marketing. The licensing agreement with The Starco Group provided Starco Brands with exclusive royalty-free rights to a body of products in the following categories: food, household cleaning, air care, spirits and personal care. The Starco Group is predominantly an aerosol and liquid fill private label manufacturer with manufacturing assets in the following verticals: DIY/Hardware, paints, coatings and adhesives, household, air care, disinfectants, automotive, motorcycle, arts & crafts, personal care cosmetics, personal care FDA, sun care, food, cooking oils, beverage, spirits and wine.

The current CEO of The Starco Group, Ross Sklar, was named the CEO of Starco Brands in August of 2017. Mr. Sklar has a long track record of commercializing technology in industrial and consumer markets. Mr. Sklar has built teams of manufacturing personnel, R&D and sales and marketing professionals over the last 20 years and has grown The Starco Group into a successful and diversified manufacturer supplying a wide range of products to some of the largest retailers in the United States.
 
The Company has conducted extensive research and has identified specific channels to penetrate with its new portfolio of novel technologies. The Company has begun to execute this vision and has launched the first product line called ‘Breathe ™’, through our manufacturing partner, The Starco Group. The Company has applied for a registered trademark for Breathe with the United States Patent and Trade Office. Breathe is an environmentally-friendly line of household cleaning aerosol products. It is the worlds first aerosol household cleaning line to be approved by the EPAs Safer Choice program. This product line is biodegradable and is propelled by nitrogen, which makes up approximately 80% of the earths breathable air. The Company launched the line with Wegmans, a $7 billion grocery retailer recognized as an innovative leader among retailers. The Breathe line is currently on shelves in all Wegmans stores. The Company has begun to implement an online sales strategy and Breathe is now available on Amazon. The Company is now executing a national sales program and Breathe is currently being presented to many national retailers in the United States. 
 
To secure assistance with marketing and logistics for our products, The Starco Group, recently entered into a distribution and sales agreement with United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI), an $8 billion dollar distributor. UNFI is currently marketing our new Breathe household cleaning line. UNFI has access to over 15,000 retail stores that the Company plans to access over the next 36 months. In addition, the Company plans to launch other products in air care, food, personal care, spirits and beverages over the next 60 months. Although the initial market reception to Breathe has been encouraging, the Company may encounter a number of hurdles that could prevent this and future product launches from achieving sustained commercial success. 
 
Management has engaged a third party to evaluate the Companys new business plan and to provide a valuation opinion based on the projected sales over the course of a 10-year period. Based on this pro forma third-party valuation, the Company established a series of seed financing rounds to raise capital through the issuance and sale of the Companys common stock. We currently have no plans for a public offering of our stock and such stock sales will likely be exempt from the registration requirements provided by federal and state securities laws. The purchasers and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs and the available exemptions to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The Company started its Seed financing on August 18, 2017 and closed it by October 25, 2017, raising a total of $600,000. The Company may engage in subsequent funding rounds later in 2018. Our intent is to use most of the capital raised for sales, marketing and compliance. 
 
The Companys ultimate goal is to become a leading supplier in the consumer marketplace through the introduction of innovative and unique products and brands whose success is expected to increase shareholder value. The Company will continue to evaluate this and other opportunities to further set its strategy for 2018, 2019 and 2020.
