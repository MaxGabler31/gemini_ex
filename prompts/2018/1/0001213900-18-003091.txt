Business Overview
 
Actinium Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and potentially commercializing targeted therapies for improved myeloablation and conditioning of the bone marrow prior to a bone marrow transplant and for the targeting and killing of cancer cells. Our targeted therapies are Antibody Radio-Conjugates, or ARC, that combine the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies (“mAb”) with the cell-killing ability of radioisotopes. Our ARC’s have demonstrated the ability to improve access to bone marrow transplants with the potential for better outcomes, namely increased marrow engraftment and survival. Our product pipeline consists of two ARC product candidates that are currently being studied in three clinical trials. Two additional clinical trials are expected to begin patient enrollment in 2018. In each of the indications, we believe our product candidates are either first-in-class or have best–in-class potential. Our lead myeloablation product candidate, Iomab-B, is currently being studied in a pivotal Phase 3 trial as a conditioning agent in older patients with relapsed or refractory (“r/r”) Acute Myeloid Leukemia AML (“AML”) who are ineligible for a bone marrow transplant as they cannot withstand chemotherapy-based conditioning. Iomab-B is an ARC that is comprised of the anti-CD45 mAb apamistamab and the radioisotope iodine-131 (“131I”). Our CD33 program trials include; the ongoing Phase 2 Actimab-A trial for patients newly diagnosed with AML over the age of 60, the Phase 1 Actimab-M trial for patients with refractory multiple myeloma, the planned Phase 2 Actimab-MDS trial for patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”) with a p53 genetic mutation and the Phase 1 Actimab-A & CLAG-M trial for patients with r/r AML. These trials are studying our ARC drug candidate comprised of the anti-CD33 mAb lintuzumab and the radioisotope actinium-225 (“225Ac”). In addition, we are developing our Actinium Warhead Enabling, or AWE, Technology Platform. We plan to leverage our intellectual property and know-how to create additional ARC drug candidates by labeling 225Ac to targeting moieties that we will either progress in clinical trials or out-license.
 
Bone marrow is semi-solid tissue found within the spongy section of bones that produces new blood cells in a process called hematopoiesis. Bone marrow contains hematopoietic stem cells that give rise to the three classes of blood cells that are found in circulation: red blood cells and platelets that are responsible for blood function and white blood cells that are responsible for immune system function. A bone marrow transplant may be the only potentially curative treatment option, or the best treatment option, for patients with blood cancers such as leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma, or benign blood, or marrow disorders such as inherited immune system disorders, sickle cell disease and severe aplastic anemia.
 
In order to receive a bone marrow transplant, (“BMT”), patients are administered treatment to ablate or destroy their bone marrow in a process referred to as myeloablation. Myeloablative treatments typically consist of chemotherapy and external radiation, which is also called total body radiation. As an alternative to myeloablation, the bone marrow may also be conditioned or prepared for a transplant via lower intensity treatment know as reduced intensity conditioning, which uses lower doses of external radiation and less toxic types of chemotherapy. Patients with blood cancers must ideally be disease–free, or at least in remission, before receiving myeloablative or conditioning therapy. Myeloablative treatments are associated with greater and more severe toxicities, including higher treatment-related mortality rates that may be too intense for patients, particularly those of advanced age, to tolerate as compared to reduced intensity conditioning. Reduced intensity conditioning is generally better tolerated by patients but is associated with higher rates of relapse, which can reduce overall survival. Our ARC based approach is designed to target blood cancer and bone marrow cells via a mAb and deliver potent radioisotope payloads directly to those cells to achieve myeloablation without systemic toxicities. In doing so, we hope to improve access to BMT for a greater number of patients while improving outcomes through improved myeloablation via our ARC technologies.
 
We have licensed our product candidates and ARC technologies from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. These licenses include rights to certain patents and we own outright patents pertaining to our product candidates and AWE technology platform. Our intellectual property portfolio consists of 68 issued and pending patent applications that we have licensed or fully own. We have compiled scientific and medical advisory boards of thought-leading physicians in their respective fields to advise and guide us though the development process of our pipeline product candidates.
 
We have also developed proprietary know-how related to the development, manufacturing and supply chain required for our product candidates. We supply our product candidates to clinical trial sites on a just-in-time basis through the manufacturing of our drug product components, final drug product and the distribution of our final drug product to medical centers where our trials are conducted. In the case of Iomab-B, we calculate, produce and supply personalized doses for our clinical trial. We have secured access to 131I produced by two premier commercial global suppliers. We project that these two suppliers have sufficient 131I production capacity to meet our commercial needs for the Iomab-B program. We have secured access to 225Ac through a renewable contractual arrangement with the United States Department of Energy, or DOE. We project that these quantities are sufficient to support early stages of commercialization of actinium isotope-based products and that the DOE’s accelerator route of production of 225Ac has the potential to provide commercial quantities of 225Ac. We have also developed our own proprietary process for industrial-scale 225Ac production in a cyclotron in quantities adequate to support full product commercialization.

Pipeline
 

 
Myeloablation Product Candidates
 
We are developing two first-in-class product candidates focused on improving access to and outcomes from bone marrow transplant through improved myeloablation. Our ARC product candidates target antigens that are expressed on certain cancer cell types with mAbs that are labeled with radioisotopes that are able to destroy cellular DNA and kill these cells with the energy that they emit. We utilize certain mAbs and radioisotopes to develop product candidates that are ideally suited for particular disease indications and patient populations. Our lead myeloablation product candidate is Iomab-B, an ARC consisting of an anti-CD45 mAb and the radioisotope iodine-131, or 131I. We are also developing an ARC consisting of the anti-CD33 mAb lintuzumab and the radioisotope actinium-225, or 225Ac, in a study that we call Actimab-MDS.
 
CD33 Program Trials
 
CD33 is an antigen that has been found to be expressed in patients with certain hematologic malignancies including AML, MDS and multiple myeloma. CD33 is expressed in up to 90% of patients with AML, approximately 75% of patients with MDS and 25-35% of patients with multiple myeloma. We are developing our lintuzumab-225Ac ARC for these indications in the following clinical trials:
 

● | Actimab-A phase 2 clinical trial for patients with AML 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Actimab-M phase 1 clinical trial for patients with multiple myeloma which is first in class and 
● | Actimab-A phase 1 clinical trial in combination with CLAG-M, a salvage chemotherapy regimen, in patients with r/r AML. 

 
We intend to develop our best-in-class CD33 program to address a broad population of patients with CD33 expressing hematologic indications and deliver the best outcomes using our ARC technological approach.

Actinium Warhead Enabling (AWE) Technology Platform and Program
 
Our proprietary AWE Technology Platform is supported by intellectual property and know-how that enables the creation of 225Ac radio-conjugates, wherein a biomolecular targeting agent is labeled with the 225Ac payload to enhance targeted cell killing. As of March 2018, we have four issued and one pending patent related to our AWE Technology Platform in the U.S. having expirations in 2021, 2030 and 2023 and 21 issued or pending patents outside of the U.S. Our intellectual property covers the use of the “gold standard” chelator DOTA, (tetracarboxylic acid), an organic compound used to attach, or conjugate, radioisotopes to monoclonal antibodies and any conceivable derivative thereof. Additionally, we hold intellectual property protection around methods of chelation or labeling of the targeting agent with 225Ac as well as newer next generation methods of chelation or labeling. We are studying our AWE Technology Platform in preclinical studies to demonstrate proof of concept to enable research collaborations and partnerships.
Business Strategy 
 
We intend to potentially develop Iomab-B and other potential myeloablation products through registration studies and approval. If our efforts are successful, we may elect to commercialize our myeloablation products on our own, or with a partner in the United States and out-license the rights to develop and commercialize the product to a strategic partner outside of the United States. If we commercialize our products independently, we intend to build a commercial distribution network that can supply our myeloablation product candidates to the top 50-100 bone marrow transplant centers in the U.S., where a majority of patients are myeloablated and receive their transplants. In the case of our CD33 program product candidates, we will potentially develop these up to and including a Phase 2 proof-of-concept human clinical trial (a trial designed to provide data on the drug’s efficacy). We will most likely seek to enter into strategic partnerships whereby the strategic partner(s) co-fund(s) further human clinical trials of the drug that are needed to obtain regulatory approvals for commercial sale within and outside of the United States. In parallel, we intend to identify and begin initial proof-of-concept trials with our AWE Technology Platform in other cancer indications. We intend to retain marketing rights for our products in the United States whenever possible and out-license marketing rights to our partners for the rest of the world. We may also seek to in license other applicable opportunities should such technology become available.
Market Opportunity 
 
We believe that improved myeloablation prior to a BMT could result in improved access and outcomes for patients, as well as provide a pharmacoeconomic benefit. The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) estimates that there approximately 22,000 patients received an autologous or allogeneic BMT’s in the United States in 2015. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 172,000 patients will be diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma or multiple myeloma and that approximately 1.2 million patients are living with, or are in remission from these diseases. A BMT is a potentially curative or potentially best treatment option for certain patients with these blood cancers and we intend to develop our ARC product candidates with the goal of improving BMT access and outcomes for these patients. According to a study published in the Journal of Medical Economics, real-world economic burden of hematopoietic cell transplantation among a large US commercially insured population with hematologic malignancies, the healthcare cost for patients receiving an autologous BMT were $390,000 while the healthcare costs for patients receiving an allogeneic BMT were $745,000. We believe that reduction in toxicities and resulting hospital stays associated with current chemotherapy-based myeloablation regimens could reduce these costs. We intend to collect pharmacoeconomic data in our current and future clinical trials for Iomab-B and other myeloablation product candidates to determine if our therapies lead to a cost benefit. Iomab-B has demonstrated efficacy in myeloablation prior to a BMT for blood cancer indications, including AML, MDS, ALL, Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, NHL and multiple myeloma. These are indications for which Iomab-B can be developed and it is our intention to explore these opportunities. We believe the aggregate worldwide market potential for the treatment of AML, MDS, ALL, Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, NHL and multiple myeloma is approximately $6.6 billion. 
 
For our CD33 program drug candidates, we are competing in the marketplace for cancer treatments estimated to have reached over $83 billion in 2016 sales, according to “The Global Use of Medicines: Outlook Through 2016 Report by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, July 2012”. While surgery, radiation and chemotherapy remain staple treatments for cancer, their use is limited by the fact that they often cause substantial damage to normal cells. On the other hand, targeted monoclonal antibody therapies exert most or all of their effect directly on cancer cells, but often lack sufficient killing power to eradicate all cancer cells with just the antibody. A new approach for treating cancer is to combine the precision of antibody-based targeting agents with the killing power of radiation, or chemotherapy, by attaching powerful killing agents to precise molecular carriers called monoclonal antibodies. We use mAbs labeled with radioisotopes to deliver potent doses of radiation directly to cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. The radioisotopes we use are the alpha emitter 225Ac and the beta emitter 131-I. 131-I is among the best known and well characterized radioisotopes. It is used very successfully in treatment of papillary and follicular thyroid cancer as well as other thyroid conditions. It is also attached to a monoclonal antibody in treatment of NHL. It is also used experimentally with different carriers in other cancers. 225Ac has many unique properties and we believe we are a leader in developing this alpha emitter for clinical applications using our proprietary AWE technology platform.

Clinical Trials
 
Myeloablation Product Candidates
 
We are focused on developing ARC product candidates that improve bone marrow transplant access and outcomes through improved myeloablation. Myeloablation is an integral step prior to a bone cell transplant whereby a patient’s bone marrow is ablated to make room for stem cells from a donor. A stem cell transplant may be the only potentially curative treatment option or the best treatment option for patients with blood cancers such as leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma or benign blood or marrow disorders such as inherited immune system disorders, sickle cell disease and severe aplastic anemia. We are currently conducting two clinical trials for product candidates focused on myeloablation, a pivotal phase 3 trial for Iomab-B and the phase 2 Actimab-MDS trial both of which are first in their class
Iomab-B Pivotal Phase 3 Trial
 
Iomab-B is our lead product candidate currently in a pivotal phase 3 multicenter clinical trial. We licensed Iomab-B from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, or FHCRC, where it was developed and studied extensively in numerous clinical trials in a range of hematologic indications and patient populations. Iomab-B consists of the monoclonal antibody apamistamab and the beta emitting radioisotope 131I. Apamistamab has been studied in 10 Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with AML, MDS, ALL, multiple myeloma and lymphomas at various stages of the disease such as newly diagnosed, relapsed or refractory and first remission. There are additional investigator-initiated trials ongoing at FHCRC. The indication selected for our pivotal phase 3 trial is myeloablation and bone marrow conditioning for HSCT in patients with relapsed and refractory AML over the age of 55.
 
Previous Iomab-B clinical trials leading to our current pivotal Phase 3 trial included:
 

Indications | N | Key Findings 
----------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AML, MDS, ALL (adult) | 34 | –7/34 patients with median disease-free state (“DFS”) of 17 years. 
 | | –18/34 patients in remission at day 80 
AML >1st remission (adult) | 23 | –15/23 in remission at day 28 
AML 1st remission (age 16-50) | 43 | –23/43 DFS from 5-16 years 
 | | –30/43 in remission at day 28 
 | | –33/43 in remission at day 80

Ongoing clinical trials using the apamistamab antibody include:
 

Indications | Phase

AML, ALL and high-risk MDS | Phase 1/2

Actimab-MDS Phase 2 Trial
 
In December 2017, we announced Actimab-MDS, a planned phase 2 trial for our second ARC product candidate focused on improved myeloablation. Actimab-MDS consists of the anti-CD33 mAb lintuzumab labeled with the radioisotope 225Ac. The planned Actimab-MDS phase 2 will be conducted with the MDS Clinical Research Consortium that is comprised of the Cleveland Clinical Taussig Cancer Institute, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, MD Anderson Cancer Center, H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Weill Medical College of Cornell University and the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins. Dr. Gail Roboz, Director, Leukemia Program and Professor of Medicine at Weill Medical College of Cornell University will serve as principal investigator for the trial.
 
The Actimab-MDS trial will enroll patients with high-risk MDS that have a p53 genetic mutation, which is estimated to occur in approximately 20% of MDS patients. Patients with a p53 mutation have been found to have poorer survival outcomes following a bone marrow transplant. We expect to meet with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, or FDA, in the first half of 2018 to discuss the regulatory pathway for this product candidate. Currently, we expect to conduct a 50-80 patient, single arm, phase 2 trial. Patients enrolled in the trial will receive a single infusion of lintuzumab labeled with 225Ac at a dose of 4.0 µCi/kg prior to receiving a bone marrow transplant. We expect that overall survival will be the primary endpoint of the study measured at either one or two years.
 
CD33 Program Trials
 
We are developing our ARC product candidate that consists of the anti-CD33 mAb lintuzumab and the radioisotope 225Ac for multiple hematologic malignancies. CD33 is an antigen shown to be expressed in up to 90% of patients with AML, 75% of patients with MDS and 35% of patients with multiple myeloma. Our lintzumab-225Ac ARC is a second-generation construct that was developed at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, or MSKCC. The first-generation product consisted of the same monoclonal antibody lintuzumab but utilized the radioisotope bismuth-213 (“213Bi”), a daughter of 225Ac.
 
In preclinical animal models, doses in the nanocurie range prolonged survival. In humans, Actimab-A was previously studied in a Phase 1 monotherapy trial of relapsed or refractory AML patients at MSKCC. Dose levels in that study re-confirmed the substantially higher potency of 225Ac -lintuzumab, as compared to equivalent dosing of the first-generation 213Bi-lintuzumab construct, which had nevertheless established safety and efficacy in a Phase 1/2 trial in high-risk AML with cytoreduction.
 
High potency means that a relatively low amount of drug is needed to produce a given effect. In preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies, 225Ac -lintuzumab has demonstrated at least 500-1000 times higher potency than the first-generation predecessor 213Bi-lintuzumab upon which it is based. This difference is due to intrinsic physicochemical properties of 225Ac -lintuzumab that were first established in vitro, in which 225Ac -lintuzumab killed multiple cell lines at doses at least 1000 times lower (based on LD50 values) than 213Bi-lintuzumab analogs. Key factors in 225Ac -lintuzumab’s higher potency are the yield of 4 alpha-emitting isotopes per 225Ac (compared to 1 alpha decay for bismuth 213) and much longer half-life (10 day for 225Ac vs 46 minutes for 213Bi).

Collectively, these two constructs have been studied in over 100 patients including the following trials:
 

— | Phase 1 clinical trial with Bismab-A, the first-generation product consisting of the same monoclonal antibody Lintuzumab and 213Bi alpha emitter, a daughter of 225Ac; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
— | Phase 1/2 clinical trial with Bismab-A, the first-generation product consisting of the same monoclonal antibody Lintuzumab and 213Bi alpha emitter, a daughter of 225Ac; and 
— | Dose escalating pilot Phase 1 clinical trial with Actimab-A, the current product consisting of the Lintuzumab monoclonal antibody and 225Ac -alpha emitter. 

 
Completed Actimab-A related clinical trials outcomes:
 

— | The Phase 2 arm of the Bismab-A drug study has shown signs of the drug’s efficacy and safety, including reduction in peripheral blast counts and complete responses in some patients. 213Bi is a daughter, i.e., product of the degradation of 225Ac, with cancer cell killing properties similar to 225Ac but is less potent. The Phase 1 Actimab-A trial at MSKCC with a single-dose administration of Actimab-A showed elimination of leukemia cells from blood in 67% of all evaluable patients who received a full dose and in 83% of those treated at dose levels above 0.5 microcuries per kilogram (µCi/kg), and eradication of leukemia cells in both blood and bone marrow in 20% of all evaluable patients and 25% of those treated at dose levels above 0.5 µCi/kg. Maximum tolerated single dose in this trial was established at 3 µCi/kg. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
— | The Phase 1 portion of the trial with lintuzumab 225Ac at fractionated doses was a dose-finding study. The results of the study showed that 28% (5 of 18) of patients had objective responses (2CR, 1CRp and 2 Cri (complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery) with median response duration of 9.1 months. Mean bone marrow blast reduction amongst evaluable patients (14 of 18) was 67% with 57% of patients having bone marrow blast reduction of 50% or greater and 79% (11 of 14) of patients having bone marrow blast reductions after one cycle of therapy. Maximum tolerated dose was not reached in this trial. We elected to progress to the Phase 2 portion of the trial at 2.0 μCi/kg/fraction, the highest dose level from the Phase 1 portion of the trial.

Ongoing Actimab-A Phase 2 trial:
 
Our most advanced CD33 program trial is a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients newly diagnosed with AML who are over the age of 60 and unfit for intensive chemotherapy. The Phase 2 portion of the trial will enroll 53 patients and studies Actimab-A as a monotherapy. We received agreement from the FDA for multiple revisions to the trial protocol for the Phase 2 portion of the trial that include: 
 

— | Removing the use of low dose cytarabine from the Phase 2 protocol, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
— | Stipulating peripheral blast burden as an inclusion criteria with 200 ML being the threshold 
— | Mandating the use of hydroxyurea in patients with peripheral blast count above 200 ML to lower their peripheral blasts below 200ML/ prior to Actimab-A administration 
— | Mandating the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) support 

 
At the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, annual meeting in December 2017, we presented via poster, preliminary results from the ongoing phase 2 clinical trial. This trial is enrolling patients newly diagnosed with AML who are over the age of 60 that are unfit for intense chemotherapy. This trial allows patients with prior hematologic disease to enroll and 69% of patients (9 of 13) had antecedent hematologic disease (5 MDS, 2 CMML, 1 Atypical CML, 1 tAML) and 7 of these patients were previously treated with hypomethylating agents. We reported a 69% objective response in evaluable patients (9 of 13) (3 CRp and 6 CRi), and our target response rate for this trial was 35%. We also reported a 98% median reduction in bone marrow blasts (10 of 13). Minimal extramedullary toxicities were observed in this patient population. Myelosuppression was observed in all patients and determined to be longer in duration than desirable in unfit patients who by definition are medically infirm. As a result, the dose level was reduced from 2.0 µCi/kg to 1.5 µCi/kg on Days 1 and 8.

Actimab-M Phase 1 Trial
 
Actimab-M is comprised of the anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody lintuzumab coupled to 225Ac and is the same construct, which is currently being studied in a Phase 2 Actimab-A clinical trial in patients newly diagnosed with AML who are over the age of 60. The Phase 1 Actimab-M trial is an open label, dose-escalation study. Patients will be administered a starting dose level of 0.5 μCi/Kg via infusion on day 1 of each cycle for up to 8 cycles with each cycle lasting 42 days. If this dose level is deemed safe, a second dose level of 1.0 μCi/kg will be explored for up to 4 cycles, also of 42 days per cycle. Total dose received per patient is not to exceed 4.0 μCi/kg. In the event of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at the 0.5 μCi/Kg dose level, a dose level of 0.25 μCi/Kg will be explored. The Phase 1 trial will estimate maximum tolerated dose (MTD), assess adverse events, measure response rates (objective response rate, complete response rate, stringent complete response rate, very good partial response rate and partial response rate) as well as progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). To our knowledge, we are the only company developing a multi-disease CD33 targeting program and the first company to develop a CD33 targeting product candidate for patients with multiple myeloma.
 
Actimab-A and CLAG-M Phase 1 Trial
 
In February 2018, we announced that the Medical College of Wisconsin would be starting an investigator-initiated Phase 1 trial studying our lintuzumab-225Ac ARC in combination with CLAG-M, a salvage chemotherapy regimen. CLAG-M consists of Cladribine, Cytarabine, G-CSF and Mitoxantrone that is administered to patients over five consecutive days. This Phase 1 trial will add a single infusion of Actimab-A to CLAG-M that will be administered on day 7. This is a dose-finding study that will explore Actimab-A at dose levels of 0.25 uCi/kg, 0.50 uCi/kg and 0.75 uCi/kg that will assess safety by monitoring DLT’s. In addition, efficacy will be assessed by remission rates (CR, CRp, and CRi), rate of patients receiving a bone marrow transplant, overall survival at 1 year and progression free survival (“PFS”).
  
Actinium Warhead Enabling (AWE) Technology Platform and Program
 
Our proprietary AWE Technology Platform is supported by intellectual property and know-how that enables the creation of 225Ac radio conjugates wherein a biomolecular targeting agent is labeled with the 225Ac payload to enhance targeted cell killing. As of March 2018, we have four issued and one pending patent related to our AWE Technology Platform in the U.S. having expirations in 2021, 2030 and 2023 and 21 issued or pending patents outside of the U.S The intellectual property covers the use of the “gold standard” chelator DOTA, (tetracarboxylic acid), an organic compound used to attach, or conjugate, radioisotopes to monoclonal antibodies and any conceivable derivative thereof. Additionally, we hold intellectual property protection around methods of chelation or labeling of the targeting agent with 225Ac as well as newer next-generation methods of chelation or labeling.
 
In November 2017 we announced the availability of our proprietary AWE Technology Platform via the AWE Program for partnerships and collaborations. In tandem, we demonstrated the AWE Technology Platform at the ASH 2017 Annual Meeting with the targeting agent daratumumab - an asset that is distinct from the Company’s AWE-generated, clinical-stage lintuzumab-225Ac. Daratumumab is an anti-CD38 antibody which is marketed by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) under the trade name Darzalex® for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We first demonstrated the adaptability of the AWE Technology Platform by successfully labeling daratumumab with 225Ac. Importantly, the ability of the 225Ac enabled daratumumab to engage with its target was unhindered compared to the naked daratumumab. The stability of the constructs was tested to assure reliable labeling. The impact of 225Ac-daratumumab was then compared to that of the naked antibody in three cells lines with varying expression levels of the CD38 target. Treatment of these cell lines with 225Ac-daratumumab demonstrated both a time and concentration-dependence and, in every instance the 225Ac-enabled daratumumab demonstrated superior cell killing over its unlabeled counterpart. As an additional control and to demonstrate the specificity of the cell killing, a cell line that did not express the intended CD38 target was treated with both 225Ac-daratumumab and daratumumab. In this scenario no cell killing was observed for both the treatment groups, supporting that cell killing observed with the 225Ac-daratumumab is specific and that there are no off-target effects from the radioisotope. Following this initial promising validation, further pre-clinical development of the 225Ac-daratumumab asset has been pursued, wherein the value of the 225Ac-daratumumab was assessed in vivo in xenograft mouse models.
 
We have led and successfully demonstrated the adaptability and robust labeling that can be achieved with the AWE Platform Technology. Moreover, the AWE Program provides a potential partner with access to the know-how, capabilities and facilities to execute on a validation study for an 225Ac enabled radio conjugate in addition to access to the AWE Platform Technology. The studies with 225Ac-daratumumab provides an example of the enhanced therapeutic effect that can be achieved from the utilization of our core platform technology to enable an asset with 225Ac positioning the generation of actinium radio conjugates as a viable therapeutic approach.
 
Operations
 
Our current operations are primarily focused on furthering the development of our clinical drug candidates for myeloablation, our CD33 program drug candidates, supporting investigator-initiated clinical trials that use our drug candidates and leveraging our AWE platform to create new clinical programs and contribute to collaborations.
 
Operations related to Iomab-B include progressing the ongoing multi-center Phase 3 pivotal trial (a trial that leads to registration trial marketing approved by the FDA), which includes investigator engagement, site activation and supporting patient enrollment. In addition, we are focused on commercial-scale manufacturing of apamistamab suitable for an approval trial and preparation of appropriate regulatory submissions. We are also focused on producing final Iomab-B drug product material that consists of apamistamab labelled with the isotope 131I. We have secured access to 131I produced by two premier commercial global suppliers. We project that these two suppliers have sufficient 131I production capacity to meet our commercial needs for the Iomab-B program. We are aware of other global suppliers of 131I with whom we believe we can secure commercial supply agreement if necessary. Operations related to our planned Phase 2 Actimab-MDS trial include preparation for appropriate regulatory submissions, protocol development and investigator engagement.

In the case of our CD33 program, key ongoing activities include progressing the multi-center Phase 2 Actimab-A trial, the Phase 1 Actimab-M trial and planned Phase 1 Actimab-A and CLAG-M combination trial, managing isotope and other materials supply chain and managing the manufacturing of the finished drug candidate product. We have secured access to 225Ac through a renewable contractual arrangement with the United States Department of Energy, or DOE. We project that these quantities are sufficient to support early stages of commercialization of actinium isotope-based products and that the DOE’s accelerator route of production of 225Ac has the potential to provide commercial quantities of 225Ac. We have also developed our own proprietary process for industrial-scale 225Ac production in a cyclotron in quantities adequate to support full product commercialization. In addition, we are aware of numerous sources from which we may secure additional quantities of the 225Ac isotope.
 
Intellectual Property Portfolio and Regulatory Protections
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have developed or in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets related to the development and manufacture of our products. As of March 2018, our patent portfolio includes: 68 issued and pending patent applications, of which 11 are issued in the United States, 4 are pending in the United States, and 53 are issued internationally and pending internationally. Additionally, several non-provisional patent applications are expected to be filed in 2018 based on provisional patent applications filed in 2017. This is part of an ongoing strategy to strengthen our intellectual property position. About one quarter of our patents are in-licensed from third parties and the remainder are Actinium-owned. These patents cover key areas of our business, including use of the actinium-225 and other alpha emitting isotopes attached to cancer specific carriers like monoclonal antibodies, methods for manufacturing key components of our product candidates including actinium-225, the alpha emitting radioisotope and carrier antibodies, and methods for manufacturing finished product candidates for use in cancer treatment.
 
We have licensed the rights to two issued patents in the area of drug preparation for methods of making humanized antibodies for our product Actimab-A that will expire in 2018 and 2019, respectively. We own five issued patents including one divisional patent in the United States and 32 patents outside of the United States, including one divisional patent related to the manufacturing of actinium in a cyclotron that will expire in 2027. We own or have licensed the rights to three issued patents in the United States and 14 patents outside of the United States related to the generation of radioimmunoconjugates that will expire in 2021, 2030 and 2032 respectively. We own or have licensed the rights to use one issued patent, one pending patent and two provisional patents for methods of treatment with our product Actimab-A that will expire in 2019. For Iomab-B we own one pending patent for anti-CD45 immunoglobulin composition and one pending patent the administration of a conjugated antibody.
 
A patent whose claims address methods of treating hematopoietic malignancies with Iomab-B is pending; still, we have developed a proprietary strategy based on trade secret protection and the potential for orphan drug and data exclusivities. The BC8 antibody, cell line and related know-how has been exclusively licensed by us from FHCRC in exchange for milestone payments, royalties and research support.
 
Patents related to the lintuzumab antibody component of our CD33 product candidates have been exclusively licensed by us from AbbVie Biotherapeutics Corp. for use with alpha-emitting radioisotopes in exchange for future development and commercialization milestones, a royalty on net sales for a period of 12.5 years from first commercial sale, a negotiation right to be our clinical and/or commercial antibody supplier, a negotiation right to co-promote Actimab-A in the United States on terms to be negotiated, and the grant-back of intellectual property (IP) rights covering improvements to the antibody for use other than with an alpha-emitting isotope. Patents covering actinium-225 conjugated to antibodies have been exclusively licensed by us from MSKCC in exchange for license fees, research support payments, development milestone payments, and royalties on net sales for the term of the licensed patents or, if later, 10 years from first commercial sale, or of any sublicense income we may receive. We source 225Ac under an agreement with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory that expires at the end of 2018. We believe that we will be able to renew this contract for additional annual periods, as we have since 2009.
 
Regulatory Protections
 
The indications for which we are developing our product candidates for are orphan drug designations, which are disease indications that affect fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States and less than 5 in 10,000 patients in the European Union (“EU”). We have received orphan drug designation for Iomab-B and our lintuzumab-CD33 ARC for patients with AML in both the United States and the EU. As a result, if our products are to be approved they may receive 7 years and 10 years of market exclusivity in the US and EU, respectively. In addition, our product candidates are biologics combined with radioisotopes. The Hatch-Waxman Act requires that a manufacturer of generic drugs, for which a biologic drug is called a biosimilar, requires that the manufacturer demonstrate bioequivalence. We believe that due to the nature of radioisotopes having half-lives combined with the complexities of biologic drugs would make it difficult for a manufacturer to demonstrate bioequivalence of our product candidates.
Competition Overview
 
In the field of bone marrow transplantation, pharmaceuticals currently used for bone marrow ablation/conditioning are generic drugs and to our knowledge there are no significant industry efforts to advance clinical programs in the area of myeloablation that are directly competitive, especially in older patients. To our knowledge, we are the only company with a multi-disease, multi-target product pipeline that is focused on myeloablation.

For our CD33 Program, there are several companies developing drugs for AML based on numerous approaches/modalities including antibody drug conjugate (ADC), naked monoclonal antibodies and bispecific antibodies. Mylotarg™, an ADC developed and marketed by Pfizer is the only FDA approved CD33 targeted therapy for adult patients and children two years and older with relapsed or refractory CD33-positive AML. Seattle Genetics was developing SGN-CD33A, a CD33 targeting ADC, but discontinued the development of its clinical trials associated with this product candidate in June 2017. Immunogen is also developing a CD33 targeting ADC, IMGN779, that is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial for r/r AML patients age 18 and above. Amgen is developing a CD3/CD33 bispecific BiTE (AMG330) as is Amphivena (AMV-564), both of which are in Phase 1 clinical trial for r/r AML patients age 18 and above. Boehringer Ingelheim is developing a CD33 targeting naked antibody (BI836858) for patients with r/r AML or MDS age 18 and above. These drugs have different safety profiles and mechanisms of action compared to our drug candidates. AML in older patients remains an area of high medical need that could accommodate many new products with favorable safety and efficiency profiles. We will begin studying our 225Ac – lintuzumab ARC in combination with chemotherapy regimens for patients with AML. We have announced that our first combination trial will be with CLAG-M for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Combination therapies are commonly used in hematologic indications, but we believe we are the only 225Ac based ARC product candidate that is being explored in combination studies in hematologic indications. To our knowledge, we are the only company with a CD33 targeting drug and the only 225Ac based ARC product candidate for patients with multiple myeloma.
   
Government Regulation
 
Governmental authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing of radioimmunotherapy pharmaceutical products such as those being developed by us. In the United States, the FDA regulates such products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and implements regulations. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation
 
Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Most notably, all of our products that may in the future be sold in the United States are subject to regulation by the FDA. Certain of our product candidates in the United States require FDA pre-marketing approval of a BLA pursuant to 21 C.F.R. § 314. Foreign countries may require similar or more onerous approvals to manufacture or market these products.
 
Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or other regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions, including but not limited to, untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products; operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing or delaying our requests for BLA premarket approval of new products or modified products; withdrawing BLA approvals that have already been granted; and refusal to grant export.
 
Employees
 
As of March 16, 2018, we have 25 full-time employees. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. We also engage consultants on an as-needed basis to supplement existing staff.
