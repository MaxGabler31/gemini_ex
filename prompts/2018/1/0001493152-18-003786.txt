Company Overview
 
We are a fully integrated commercial and bioinformatics company that provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services. We develop and commercialize molecular diagnostic tests and related first line assays principally focused on early detection of patients at high risk of cancer and leveraging the latest technology to improve patient outcomes. We currently have four commercialized molecular diagnostic assays in the marketplace for which we are reimbursed by Medicare and multiple private payers: PancraGEN®, which is a pancreatic cyst and pancreaticobiliary solid lesion molecular test that helps physicians better assess risk of pancreaticobiliary cancers using our proprietary PathFinderTG® platform; ThyGenX®, which is a oncogenic mutation panel that helps identify malignant thyroid nodules; and ThyraMIR®, which is a proprietary microRNA gene expression assay that helps to classify risk of cancer in thyroid nodules. We also launched in September 2017 RespriDX ™, which is a molecular test that helps physicians differentiate metastatic or recurrent lung cancer from the presence of a newly formed primary lung cancer. RespriDX™ also utilizes our PathFinderTG® platform to compare the genomic fingerprint of two or more sites of lung cancer. We are also in the process of “soft launching” BarreGen®, an esophageal cancer risk classifier for Barrett’s Esophagus, while we gather additional market data. BarreGen® also utilizes our PathFinderTG® platform.
 
Our mission is to provide personalized medicine through molecular diagnostics and innovation to advance patient care based on rigorous science. We are leveraging our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) licensed, College of American Pathologists (“CAP”), and New York State (“NYS”) accredited laboratories to develop and commercialize our assays and products. We aim to provide physicians and patients with diagnostic options for detecting genomic and other molecular alterations that are associated with gastrointestinal, endocrine, and lung cancers. Our customers consist primarily of physicians, hospitals and clinics.
 
The global molecular diagnostics market is estimated to be $6.45 billion and is a segment within the approximately $60 billion in vitro diagnostics market according to statistics from Kalorama Information, publisher of the Worldwide Market for In Vitro Diagnostic Tests. We believe that the molecular diagnostics market offers significant growth and strong patient value given the substantial opportunity it affords to lower healthcare costs by helping to reduce unnecessary surgeries and ensuring the appropriate frequency of monitoring. We are keenly focused on growing our test volumes, securing additional coverage and reimbursement, maintaining and growing our current reimbursement and supporting revenue growth for our four commercialized innovative tests, introducing related first line product and service extensions, as well as expanding our business by developing and promoting synergistic products, like BarreGEN® in our markets.
 
Additional Reimbursement Coverage During 2017 and 2018 (to-date)
 
Reimbursement progress is key for any molecular diagnostic company. We were successful in expanding the reimbursement of our products in 2017. Specifically the most significant progress we have made regarding payers in 2017 is as follows:

● | In April 2017, we announced that UnitedHealthcare, the largest health plan in the United States, has agreed to cover our ThyraMIR® test used in assessing indeterminate thyroid nodule fine needle aspirate (“FNA”) biopsies. The coverage is now in effect and is subject to members’ specific benefit plan design.

● | In July 2017, we announced that Cigna, one of the largest national health plans in the United States, has agreed to cover Interpace’s ThyGenX® test for Cigna’s 15 million members nationwide, with coverage effective immediately. Cigna’s coverage when combined with Aetna, UnitedHealthcare, Medicare and other payers brings the total number of covered lives for ThyGenX® to approximately 275 million patients nationwide. 
● | In August 2017, we announced that Oxford Health Plans began to cover our ThyraMIR® test. Oxford offers health care benefits to employers primarily in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut making it one of the largest health plans in the heavily populated tri-state Region. 
● | In September 2017, we announced that the American Medical Association (AMA) assigned a new, discreet Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) code to facilitate reimbursement of ThyraMIR®. simplifying and expediting the process for us in submitting claims and securing reimbursement. 
● | In October 2017, we announced that Medicare reimbursement for our ThyGenX® molecular test for indeterminate thyroid nodules will increase by 40% starting January 1, 2018. Medicare represents approximately 40% of our volume for the ThyGenX® test. 
● | In February 2018, we announced that Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, the oldest and largest health plan in New Jersey, covering 3.8 million patients living in the Northeastern United States, has agreed to cover ThyGenX® and ThyraMIR® for its members effective January 9, 2018. 
● | In March 2018, we announced coverage of ThyGenX® and ThyraMIR® by four new Blue Cross Blue Shield Plans, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona; Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina; Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Iowa; and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Dakota. These four plans combined represent over 5 million members. 

Corporate Information
 
We were originally incorporated in New Jersey in 1986 and began commercial operations as a contract sales organization or “CSO” in 1987, which provided the personal promotion of pharmaceutical customers’ products through outsourced sales teams. In connection with our initial public offering, we reincorporated in Delaware in 1998. Having disposed of substantially all of the assets of our CSO business in 2015, we currently operate under one operating segment, which is our molecular diagnostic business. We conduct our business through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Interpace LLC, which was formed in Delaware in 2013, and Interpace Diagnostics Corporation (formerly known as RedPath Integrated Pathology, Inc.), which was formed in Delaware in 2007. Our executive offices are located at Morris Corporate Center 1, Building C, 300 Interpace Parkway, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054. Our telephone number is (855) 776-6419.
Strategy
 
Our primary goal is to build a leading oncology diagnostics and bioinformatics business focused on gastrointestinal, endocrine and lung cancer markets. We seek to grow our molecular diagnostics business both organically as well as by selective partnering, which could potentially include acquisitions or a merger. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include:

● | Leveraging our commercial products, including PancraGEN®, ThyGenX®, ThyraMIR®, and growing our newly-launched, metastatic versus primary lung cancer test, RespriDX™, while focusing on personalized medicine and early intervention related to cancer risk; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expanding our soft launch of BarreGEN®, our esophageal cancer risk classifier for Barrett’s Esophagus that utilizes our PathFinderTG® platform, to continue to gather data and seek key reimbursement support while seeking larger partners to collaborate with us and speed up full market introduction; 
● | Targeting synergistic product and service opportunities to distribute through our commercial structure; 
● | Developing and commercializing other related first-line assays and service offerings such as PanDNA, AccuCEA Insights and adding the TERT marker of aggressiveness to our thyroid markers; 
● | Expanding our sales staff rationally, while supporting our products with high quality data and studies and seeking dependable and appropriate reimbursement rates; 
● | Expanding our bioinformatics data collected (currently from over 45,000 patients), utilizing registries to improve our assays and leveraging data with potential collaborators;

Recent Business Developments 
 
Commercial Expansion
 
In August 2017, we announced the renewal and expansion of our agreement with Lab Corp, a NYSE listed company which provides leading-edge medical laboratory tests and services through a national network of primary clinical laboratories and specialty testing laboratories, to now co-market ThyraMIR® along with ThyGenX®.
 
On December 18, 2017, we announced that we had entered into a Laboratory Services Agreement with ARUP Laboratories, Inc. (ARUP), of Salt Lake City, Utah, whereby ARUP is utilizing us as a laboratory services provider for its menu of molecular testing services. ARUP is a national reference laboratory with one of the broadest test menus in the industry. ARUP offers comprehensive diagnostic laboratory testing to a wide array of customers including hospitals, hospital groups, commercial laboratories, GPO’s, and large clinics among others, expanding our reach to providers nationwide.
 
Clinical Evidence
 
In May 2017, we announced the data presented in six posters at the Digestive Disease Week (DDW) meeting held May 6th-9th at the McCormick Center in Chicago, Illinois:

● | The results presented in three of the posters support the clinical utility of PancraGEN® in assessing long-term risk of malignancy in pancreatic cystic lesions and stress the importance of using DNA analysis to better understand the risk of cancer cysts with indeterminate profiles 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The results presented in the additional three posters support the clinical utility of PancraGEN as an ancillary test for solid lesions of the pancreas and bile duct using our unique method for testing free-DNA obtained from bile duct brushings and fine needle aspirates. 

 
In October 2017 we announced the presentation of new data based on actual clinical results for 3,471 patients tested with our ThyGenX/ThyraMIR molecular tests at the annual meeting of The American Thyroid Association (ATA) held in Victoria, British Columbia. Over 5,000 endocrinologists, endocrine surgeons, and numerous other providers who focus on endocrinology attended this annual event.
 
In October 2017, we reported two publications presented at the WCOG American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2017 Conference held in Orlando, Florida:
 

● | The “Long-Term Risk of Surgery and Cancer in Patients Meeting AGA 2015 and Fukuoka 2012 Management Criteria for Pancreatic Cystic Lesions.” 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | “Regenerated Squamous Epithelium Following Radiofrequency Ablation Manifests Molecular Alterations Present in the Pretreated Barrett’s Mucosa.” 



In November 2017, we announced that the New York State Department of Health has reviewed and approved for marketing our TERT service offering, which can be ordered in conjunction with our ThyGenX® molecular panel or on a stand-alone basis. While we currently market both ThyGenX® and ThyraMIR® in New York State, until now the TERT offering has been awaiting New York State approval. We believe that the TERT marker is a strong molecular predictor of the aggressiveness of thyroid cancer and adds additional insights into a patient’s molecular profile.
 
In October 2017 we also announced that G2 Intelligence, the official publication of the Laboratory Industry Report and sponsor of the G2 War College, selected us as the “Company of the Month for September 2017”.
 
In January 2018, we announced that CIO Applications magazine designated us as one of the top 20 Companies in 2017 for providing bioinformatics solutions to their customers through our extensive data base.
 
In February 2018, we announced the acceptance of five abstracts being presented at the US and Canadian Academy of Pathology (USCAP) in Vancouver, British Columbia.
 
Reporting Segments
 
We currently operate under one operating segment, which is our molecular diagnostic business. Until December 22, 2015 prior to the sale of the CSO business, we operated under two reporting segments: Commercial Services and Interpace Diagnostics. The former CSO business is reported as discontinued operations for the periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Our Business
 
In August 2014, we acquired certain assets from Asuragen Inc., or Asuragen, in the endocrine and thyroid cancer sectors, and in October 2014, we acquired our pancreatic and gastrointestinal assets from RedPath Integrated Technologies Inc., or RedPath. In December 2015, we sold substantially all of the assets of our CSO business and became a dedicated molecular diagnostics, bioinformatics and related first line assay company.
 
We are a molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics company that is focused on improving patient care by resolving diagnostic uncertainty with evidence that is trustworthy and actionable. Our products and services uniquely combine genomic technology, clinical science and pathological review to provide answers that give physicians and patients a clear path forward and help avoid risky, costly surgeries that are often unnecessary.
 
Our goal is to drive shareholder value by improving patient outcomes and reducing the cost of healthcare.
 
The role of molecular diagnostic and bioinformatics information in medical practice is evolving rapidly. The diagnosis of complex diseases as well as the role of molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics in treatment decisions continues to expand to complement the evaluation performed by pathologists. Information at the molecular level and registries of such data enable one to understand more fully the makeup and specific subtype of disease to improve diagnosis. In many cases, the molecular diagnostic and bioinformatics information derived can ultimately help guide treatment decisions as part of the standard of care.
 
We deploy biomarker analysis combined with microRNA expression to improve diagnostic clarity for cancer. In our thyroid and pancreatic cancer indications, cytopathological diagnosis can be ambiguous and can lead to indeterminate first line assessments and uncertainty among physicians regarding how to effectively treat patients. According to ATA, approximately 15%-35% of the early stage thyroid biopsies are initially indeterminate. Accordingly, physicians may often select surgery due to lack of confirmation of disease progression. Our thyroid tests are designed to provide clarity of diagnosis that can in turn guide treatment decisions often, eliminating costly, risky surgeries and other unnecessary medical procedures, improving the lives of patients and saving the healthcare system money.
 
Patients typically access our tests through their physician during the diagnostic process. All of our testing services are made available through our clinical reference laboratories located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and New Haven, Connecticut, which are each CLIA certified and CAP accredited.
 
The published evidence supporting our tests demonstrates what we believe is the robustness of our science and clinical studies. Patients and physicians can access our full list of publications on our website. We continue to build upon our extensive library of bioinformatic data and clinical evidence. We also expect to continue expanding our offerings in gastrointestinal, endocrinology and lung cancers, as well as other cancer indications that we believe will benefit from our technology and approach.
 
We believe our focus on developing clinically useful tests that improve patient care while addressing the cost of healthcare is enabling the company to continue to expand in this marketplace. Our thyroid assays, ThyGenX® and ThyraMIR®, are covered by our local Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC), Novitas Solutions, and are now covered for more than 275 million people in the U.S. for use in thyroid cancer diagnosis. We announced the coverage of ThyGenX® and ThyraMIR® by numerous commercial payers during 2017 including United Healthcare and Cigna, as well as our national contract with Aetna and the renewal of our joint marketing program with LabCorp. Our pancreas assay, PancraGEN®, for pancreatic cancer is also covered by Novitas Solutions and is now covered for more than 97 million people in the US.

Our newly launched lung assay, RespriDX™ for use in differentiating between metastatic versus primary cancer is covered by the majority of private payers, including their Medicare Advantage Plans, and an assessment for coverage is underway by Novitas for the traditional Medicare population. BarreGEN® for assessing Barrett’s Esophagus is currently not reimbursed by our MAC nor is it covered by any major private payers.
Background
 
The molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics segment is highly fragmented with numerous science-based companies that have developed clinical tests or data solutions that are on the market or ready or near ready to be marketed. A vast majority of these companies have limited experience bringing a test to market and many of them do not have sufficient capital to build an infrastructure to effectively commercialize their products or tests. Due to their complexity, most molecular diagnostic tests and bioinformatics databases require a specialized go-to-market strategy that includes messaging to physicians, hospitals and potentially patients and managed care organizations as well as to pharma companies that are developing therapeutically relevant products. Additionally, robust data and clinical studies are often necessary to demonstrate to physicians, managed care organizations, guideline developers and other potential customers the benefit and utility of the assays and services offered. We believe that developing and delivering these kinds of messages is one of our core strengths.
 
Oncology, which represents the third largest segment after infectious disease and blood screening, is one of the fastest growing segments of the molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, of the Department of Health and Human Services estimated in June 2014 that there were more than 5,900 independent clinical reference laboratories and specialty clinics, and more than 8,900 hospital-based laboratories, in the United States.
 
Our Molecular Diagnostic Tests
 
We are developing and commercializing molecular diagnostic tests to detect genetic alterations that are associated with gastrointestinal, endocrine and lung cancer risk, which are principally focused on early detection and identification of high potential progressors to cancer. Our tests assist healthcare providers in distinguishing between patients at risk for progression to cancer versus non-progressors. Thus, as part of a comprehensive diagnostic and treatment plan, our tests allow healthcare providers to determine whether surgery or active surveillance is most appropriate. We believe that our tests can help avoid unnecessary surgeries in those at low risk, thereby reducing healthcare costs and potential risks associated with surgery.
 
We offer PancraGEN®, a molecular diagnostic test designed for determining risk of malignancy in pancreatic cysts and solid pancreaticobiliary lesions, ThyGenX®, a next-generation sequencing test in combination with ThyraMIR®, a novel microRNA gene expression classifier, designed to assist physicians in distinguishing between benign and malignant genotypes in indeterminate thyroid nodules, and RespriDX™ our recently-launched, metastatic versus primary platform and lung cancer test. Additionally we have also developed BarreGEN®, a risk classifier assay for evaluating Barrett’s Esophagus as a precursor to esophageal cancer, which we distribute today to limited customers via our Clinical Evaluation Program or CEP, while we gather additional data, perform clinical studies and seek reimbursement.
 
Gastrointestinal Cancer Products
 
Our current gastrointestinal cancer risk diagnostic assay, PancraGEN® is based on our PathFinderTG® platform, or PathFinderTG®. PathFinderTG® is designed to use advanced clinical algorithms to accurately stratify patients according to risk of cancer by assessing panels of DNA abnormalities in patients who have pancreaticobiliary lesions (cysts or solid masses) with potential for cancer. PathFinderTG® is supported by our state of the art CLIA certified, and CAP accredited laboratory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Our Pittsburgh laboratory is our major commercial-scale and development Center of Excellence where we process the majority of our current and future oncology related commercial tests, and we support our gastrointestinal development activities through this laboratory.

Accurate detection of pancreatic cancer risk is crucial. Pancreatic cancer is now the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. with an average 5 year survival rate of 8.2% according to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”s) SEER database. PancraGEN® is designed to determine the risk of malignancy in pancreatic cysts and pancreaticobiliary solid lesions. We believe that PancraGEN® is the leading integrated molecular diagnostic test for determining risk of pancreaticobiliary malignancy currently available on the market. We currently estimate that the immediate addressable market for PancraGEN® is approximately 130,000 indeterminate pancreaticobiliary lesions annually or approximately $350 million annually based on the current size of the patient population and current and anticipated reimbursement rates. To date, PancraGEN® has been used in about 30,000 clinical cases. The National Pancreatic Cyst Registry study published in Endoscopy in 2015 demonstrated the clinical validity of PancraGEN® in that it more accurately determined the malignant potential of pancreatic cysts than the Sendai 2012 EUS criteria for detection of malignant pancreatic cystic lesions to help ensure that surgery is reserved for the most appropriate patients. When molecular analysis is not performed, the vast majority of all surgeries for pancreatic cysts are for benign disease. The American Gastroenterological Association 2015 Guidelines support the basic principle that too many pancreatic surgeries are being performed unnecessarily on benign lesions. In addition, the 2016 guidelines published by the American Society of Gastroenterology Endoscopy (ASGE) in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy included a specific recommendation for use of molecular testing in specific circumstances where other types of testing and analysis have not provided sufficient data on which to determine the best course of action for patient treatment. Accordingly, we believe that PancraGEN® provides a highly reliable diagnostic option for distinguishing between patients with pancreatic cysts who are at risk for developing pancreatic cancer.
 
We have also developed a cancer risk classifier assay, BarreGEN®, which is designed to evaluate patients with Barrett’s esophagus, an upper gastrointestinal condition that can progress into esophageal cancer. BarreGEN®, which is also run on our PathFinderTG® platform, is distributed today on a limited basis through our CEP Program allowing us to gather additional data, perform clinical studies and seek initial reimbursement. We preliminarily estimate that the total market is approximately $1.5 to $2 billion annually based on the current size of the patient population and anticipated reimbursement rates comparable to those received currently for PancraGEN® for pancreatic cysts. While we anticipate the launch of BarreGEN® in 2018, we believe that BarreGEN® can also be an excellent product to partner in this potentially large market.
 
Endocrine Cancer Products
 
We currently market and sell a dual platform endocrine cancer risk diagnostic assay. The incidence of thyroid nodules is on the rise. ThyGenX® is a next generation DNA and RNA sequencing oncogene panel and when applied to indeterminate FNA, provides a highly specific “rule-in” test with over 80% positive predictive value in predicting whether a patient’s thyroid nodule is cancerous. ThyGenX® works synergistically with our second endocrine cancer diagnostic test ThyraMir®, which is based on measuring the expression level of 10 distinct microRNAs and is designed to provide a highly sensitive “rule-out” test to accurately categorize a mutation negative indeterminate FNA as being benign or malignant. Our testing is performed in our state of the art CLIA certified, CAP accredited laboratories in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and New Haven, Connecticut. We estimate the total market for our endocrine cancer assays is approximately $350 million annually based on the current size of the patient population, estimated numbers of indeterminate FNAs and current and anticipated reimbursement rates. ThyGenX® is used by some customers as a base line oncogene panel assessment and approximately 80% of such users will reflex to also using ThyraMIR® as a more specific evaluation.
 
Endocrinologists evaluate thyroid nodules for possible cancer by collecting cells through FNA biopsies that are then analyzed by cytopathologists to determine whether or not a thyroid nodule is cancerous. It is estimated that up to 35% or up to approximately 100,000 of FNAs analyzed annually yield indeterminate results, meaning they cannot be diagnosed as definitely being malignant or benign by cytopathology alone. Traditionally, guidelines recommended that some patients with indeterminate cytopathology results undergo surgery to remove all or part of their thyroid to obtain an accurate diagnosis by looking directly at the thyroid tissue. Historically, according to a study published by Wang, et al. in 2011, in approximately 77% of these cases, the thyroid nodule proves to be benign. In addition to exposing a patient to unnecessary surgical risk and incurring costs, surgery can lead to a lifetime of thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Our ThyGenX® and ThyraMir® assays, are aimed at significantly improving the ability of physicians to determine an accurate diagnosis of an indeterminate FNA result.

Lung Cancer Product
 
RespriDX™ Test and Metastatic versus Primary Platform
 
RespriDx™ compares the mutational fingerprint of two or more sites of cancer to determine whether the neoplastic deposits are representative of a recurrence (metastasis) of lung cancer or a new primary or independent tumor. The test defines the presence or absence of cancer in atypical cytology by comparing the mutational profile with that of known previous cancer. Microdissection is used to obtain areas of cellular atypia, followed by PCR –based analysis for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using a panel of markers in proximity to 16 tumor suppressor genes including P16, PTEN, TP 53, and others. RespriDx™ assists physicians in determining the most appropriate course of treatment, whether chemotherapy, surgery, or other modalities.
Research and Development
 
We conduct most of our research and development activities at our CLIA certified and CAP accredited laboratories in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and New Haven, Connecticut. Our research and development efforts primarily focus on providing data and analyses necessary to support and improve our existing products on the market. Additionally, our research and development activities provide product line extension of our existing products as well as new product opportunities utilizing our proprietary platforms and extensive bioinformatics repositories and data bases.
 
We focus most of our research and development efforts on enhancing existing molecular diagnostic tests. We may enter into collaborative relationships with research and academic institutions for the development of additional or enhanced molecular diagnostic tests to further increase the depth and breadth of our molecular diagnostic test offerings. Where appropriate, we may also enter into licensing agreements with our collaborative partners to both license intellectual property for use in our molecular diagnostic test panels as well as licensing such intellectual property out, as appropriate.
 
Our research and development costs were approximately $1.5 million and $1.6 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Customers
 
Our customers consist primarily of physicians, hospitals and clinics. Our revenue channels include reimbursement by Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, and direct client billings (for example, hospitals and clinics), and commercial payers such as Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna, Cigna, United Healthcare and others.
Marketing
 
Our commercialization efforts are currently focused in cancers in endocrinology, gastroenterology and lung. Communication of our molecular diagnostic marketing messaging and value proposition are done principally through our two field-based sales teams of approximately 24 representatives and managers. Additionally, we communicate through print, digital advertising, a web presence, peer-reviewed publications, and trade show exhibits. We believe that our molecular diagnostic assays provide value to payers, physicians and patients by improving patient care and lowering healthcare costs through avoidance of unnecessary surgeries, reducing the morbidity associated with unnecessary surgeries for patients, and providing better diagnostic and prognostic insights to physicians. We support the value propositions of our molecular diagnostic tests through rigorous science and the accumulation of bioinformatics data that demonstrate clinical and analytical validity as well as clinical utility, and how they actually impact physicians’ decisions. Our repository of bioinformatics data accumulated in over 37,000 cases using PancraGEN and over 20,000 cases using our thyroid assays is currently a valuable tool in developing our analytics and potentially an even more valuable tool in the future.
 
We also communicate to payers, integrated delivery systems and hospital systems about our molecular diagnostic tests’ value through highly trained professionals who are experienced in reimbursement and business to business selling and through face to face meetings, phone calls, digital communications and advisory boards. We develop health economic analyses and budget impact models and incorporate these along with our clinical validation studies, and clinical utility studies to demonstrate our molecular diagnostic tests’ value to this distinct and important constituency.

Intellectual Property
 
Patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to us. We generate our own intellectual property portfolio and hold numerous patents and patent applications covering our existing and future products and technologies. As of December 31, 2017, we owned two issued United States Patents. The U.S. patents are directed to methods of treating a patient that has pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using the expression pattern of certain microRNAs to identify the patient as having PDAC and treating the identified patient and to methods of measuring carcinoembryonic antigen in a biological sample. As of December 31, 2017, we owned seven issued patents, two in Australia, Europe (validated in certain European countries), and Japan, and one in Canada, and ten pending patent applications in the United States and three pending patent applications in Brazil, Canada, and Israel. Provided all maintenance fees and annuities are paid, our issued United States patents expires in either 2032 or 2034 and our foreign patents expire in 2027 or 2031, and our pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2027 and 2032, absent any disclaimers, adjustments or extensions. On March 29, 2017 we were notified by the European Patent Office that our EP patent # 2772550 for diagnosing thyroid cancer from a sample based upon at least MIR-375 was issued (validated in Spain, France, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands) and, provided all maintenance fees and annuities are paid, expires in 2031. On January 16, 2018, we were notified that an Opposition had been filed against EP patent # 2772550 alleging that the patent is invalid. We believe that the patent is valid and intend to defend the validity of the patent in the Opposition proceedings. Our patents are directed to certain of the technologies relating to detecting, diagnosing, and classifying thyroid tumors, pancreatic cysts and other forms of gastrointestinal disorders, such as Barrett’s esophagus.


We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and proprietary processes to protect our intellectual property. We enter into non-disclosure agreements with certain vendors and suppliers to attempt to ensure the confidentiality of our intellectual property. We also enter into non-disclosure agreements with our customers. In addition, we require that all our employees sign confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements.
 
In addition to our own molecular diagnostic test development efforts, we are currently using, and intend to use in the future, certain tests and biomarkers that have been developed by third parties or by us in collaboration with third parties. While a significant amount of intellectual property in the field of molecular diagnostic tests is already in the public domain, ThyraMIR®, ThyGenX®, PancraGEN®, RespriDX™ and some of the future tests developed by us, or by third parties on our behalf for use in our tests, may require, that we license the right to use certain intellectual property from third parties and pay customary royalties or make one time payments.
 
On August 13, 2014, we consummated an agreement to acquire certain fully developed thyroid and other tests in development for thyroid cancer, associated intellectual property and a biobank with more than 5,000 patient tissue samples, or the Acquired Property Asuragen, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, or the Agreement. We paid $8.0 million at closing and paid an additional $0.5 million to Asuragen for certain integral transition service obligations set forth in a transition services agreement, entered into concurrently with the Agreement. We also entered into two license agreements with Asuragen (the Asuragen License Agreement and the CPRIT License Agreement) relating to our ability to sell the fully developed diagnostic tests and other tests in development for thyroid cancer. Under the Asuragen License Agreement, we owed a $500,000 milestone payment, all of which was paid in installments throughout 2016 and paid in full as of January 13, 2017. We are further obligated to pay royalties on the future net sales of the miRInform® pancreas platform, if developed, for a period of ten years following a qualifying sale, on the future net sales of the miRInform® thyroid platform through August 13, 2024 and on certain other thyroid diagnostics tests for a period of ten years following a qualifying sale.
 
In October 2014, we acquired our pancreatic and gastrointestinal assets from RedPath. Additionally, we have a broad and growing trademark portfolio. We have secured trademark registrations for the marks PancraGEN®, BarreGEN® and miRInform® in the United States, and miRInform® with the World Intellectual Property Organization. We also have pending trademark applications for our other molecular diagnostic tests in the United States.

Competition
 
We compete on the basis of such factors as reputation, service quality, management experience, performance record, customer satisfaction, ability to respond to specific customer needs, integration skills, product portfolio, and price. Increased competition and/or a decrease in demand for our services or molecular diagnostic tests may also lead to other forms of competition. We believe that our business has a variety of competitive advantages that allow us to compete successfully in the marketplace. While we believe we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors, certain of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have greater capital, personnel and other resources than we have. Many of our competitors also offer broader product lines outside of the molecular diagnostic testing market, and many have greater brand recognition than we do. Moreover, our competitors may make rapid technological developments that may result in our technologies and products becoming obsolete before we recover the expenses incurred to develop them or before they generate significant revenue. Increased competition may lead to pricing pressures and competitive practices that could have a material adverse effect on our market share and our ability to attract new business opportunities as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We also compete with physicians and the medical community who use traditional methods to diagnose gastrointestinal and endocrine cancers. In many cases, practice guidelines in the United States have recommended therapies, surveillance or surgery to determine if a patient’s condition is malignant or benign. As a result, we believe that we will need to continue to educate physicians and the medical community on the value and benefits of our molecular diagnostic tests in order to change clinical practices and continue to support the use of molecular diagnostic tests in clinical guidelines.
 
Specifically, in regard to our thyroid diagnostic tests, Veracyte, Inc., or Veracyte, has a molecular thyroid nodule cancer diagnostic test (Afirma) that is the current market leader and competes with our ThyGenX® and ThyraMir® tests. Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, or Quest, currently offers a diagnostic test similar to the earlier version of our ThyGenX test and recently announced an agreement to distribute the Afirma test in partnership with Veracyte. CBLPath, Inc., or CBL, is offering a diagnostic test that analyzes genetic alterations using next-generation sequencing and in 2016 Rosetta Genomics introduced a thyroid cancer micro RNA assay Rosetta Reveal GX. In addition, other thyroid based endocrine competitors include Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., Cancer Genetics, Inc., Genomic Health Inc., NeoGenomics Inc. and Trovagene, Inc.
 
We are currently not aware of any direct competitors to PancraGEN® that integrate clinical, imaging, cytology, and molecular information to stratify patients’ risk for malignancy and inform physicians on the best course of action, i.e. surgery or surveillance and surveillance interval length. Recently, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center began offering PancreaSeq, a Next Generation Sequencing “gene only” panel that focuses on the analysis of mutations in four oncogenes and three tumor suppressor genes, most of which may help establish the type of pancreatic cyst present and some of which may help establish the presence of malignancy. All but three of these related genomic regions are included in PancraGEN®. This laboratory test however does not integrate any additional information to fully characterize a patient’s risk for pancreatic cancer. Importantly, there has been no long-term clinical validation or utility studies completed on any gene panel for pancreatic cyst fluid other than that associated with PancraGEN®. PancraGEN® has been validated in multiple studies and peer reviewed publications and has been used in over 30,000 patients. Notably, the Company validated and launched during 2017 a DNA only version of PancraGEN®, known as PanDNA™.
 
It is also possible that we face future competition from laboratory-developed tests, or Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs), developed by commercial laboratories such as Quest and other diagnostic companies developing new tests or technologies. Furthermore, we may be subject to competition as a result of new, unforeseen technologies that may be developed by our competitors in the gastrointestinal and endocrine cancer molecular diagnostic tests space.
 
We are aware of companies that are in the process of developing assays and LDTs for Barrett’s esophagus, such as Cernostics Inc. In addition, NeoGenomics, Inc. is marketing a Barrett’s assay, so it appears likely that this space will also be competitive in the future.

Government Regulations and Industry Guidelines
 
The healthcare industry, and thus our business, is subject to extensive Federal, State, local and foreign regulation. Both Federal and State governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. We believe that we have structured our business operations and relationships with our customers to comply with applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and assert otherwise. We discuss below the statutes and regulations that are most relevant to our business and most frequently cited in enforcement actions.
Regulations over Our Clinical Laboratories
 
The conduct and provision of our molecular diagnostic tests are regulated under CLIA. CLIA requires us to maintain Federal certification. CLIA imposes requirements relating to test processes, personnel qualifications, facilities and equipment, recordkeeping, quality assurance and participation in proficiency testing. CLIA compliance and certification are also a condition for participation by clinical laboratories in the Medicare Program and for eligibility to bill for services provided to governmental healthcare program beneficiaries. As a condition of CLIA certification, our laboratory is subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by CMS, a CMS agent (typically a State agency), or, if the laboratory is accredited, a CMS-approved accreditation organization. Sanctions for failure to meet these certification, accreditation and licensure requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certification, accreditation or license, which is necessary to conduct business, cancellation or suspension of the laboratory’s ability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as imposition of plans to correct deficiencies, injunctive actions and civil monetary and criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could harm our business. In addition to CLIA requirements, we participate in the oversight program of the CAP. Under CMS requirements, accreditation by CAP is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of CLIA. CLIA does not preempt State laws that are more stringent than Federal law. State laws may require additional personnel quality control, record maintenance and/or proficiency testing.
 
In addition to CLIA certification, we are required to maintain State licenses to conduct testing in our Pittsburgh and New Haven laboratories. Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut laws require that we maintain a license and establish standards for the day-to-day operation of our clinical reference laboratories in Pittsburgh and New Haven. In addition, our clinical reference laboratory is required to be licensed on a test-specific basis by California, Florida, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island. California, Florida, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island laws also mandate proficiency testing for laboratories licensed under the laws of each respective State regardless of whether such laboratories are located in California, Florida, Maryland, New York or Rhode Island. On September 26, 2016 we received approval for our ThyGenX® test in New York. We are currently approved to perform ThyGenX®, ThyraMIR®, PancraGEN® RespriDX™ and BarreGEN® in all states including the state of New York. If we were to lose our CAP Accreditation, CLIA certificate or State licenses for our laboratories, whether as a result of revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to perform our molecular diagnostic tests, which would eliminate a source of revenue; this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our Pittsburgh and New Haven laboratories are also subject to licensing and regulation under Federal, State and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee right-to-know regulations, and the safety and health of laboratory employees. Additionally, our Pittsburgh and New Haven laboratories are subject to applicable Federal and State laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous waste, and laboratory specimens, including the regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and the National Fire Protection Agency. The regulations of the United States Department of Transportation, Public Health Service and Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens.
 
In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus, by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries. Although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such Federal, State and local laws, failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.

Further, laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical trial subjects must comply with CLIA, as well as requirements established by Federal law, various States laws and local regulations. In addition, we are also subject to such laws relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemical and biological agents and compounds. Typically, we use outside vendors who are contractually obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations to dispose of such waste. These vendors are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of such waste. The failure to meet these requirements may result in civil penalties and suspension or revocation of our CLIA certifications at our New Haven and Pittsburgh laboratories.
Potential U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation of Diagnostics Tests
 
Both United States Federal and State governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. As indicated by work plans and reports issued by these agencies, the Federal government will continue to scrutinize, among other things, the marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and export of molecular diagnostic tests. While subject to oversight by CMS through its enforcement of CLIA, the FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all laboratories that produce LDTs, a type of in vitro diagnostic test that is designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used in clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the United States.
 
The FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion over all LDTs. However, in October 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents: “Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests,” which provided an overview of how the FDA would regulate LDTs through a risk-based approach, and “FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests,” which provided guidance on how the FDA intends to collect information on existing LDTs, including adverse event reports. Pursuant to the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance, LDT manufacturers would be subject to medical device registration, listing, and adverse event reporting requirements. LDT manufacturers would be required to either submit a pre-market application and receive the FDA’s approval before an LDT may be marketed, or submit a pre-market notification in advance of marketing. The Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance states that within six months after the guidance documents are finalized, all laboratories will be required to give notice to the FDA and provide basic information concerning the nature of the LDTs offered. If the FDA were to regulate LDTs as proposed under the 2014 draft guidance documents, then it would classify LDTs into one of three classes according to the current system used to regulate medical devices. Class I devices are those for which reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness can be provided by adherence to the FDA’s general regulatory controls for medical devices. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the devices. Class III devices are those devices which are deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device. Under the guidance documents, LDTs would also be subject to significant post-market requirements as well.
 
On November 18, 2016, however, the FDA announced that it would not release the final guidance at this time and instead would continue to work with stakeholders, the new administration and Congress to determine the right approach. On January 13, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper on LDTs outlining a possible risk-based approach for FDA and CMS oversight of LDTs. According to the 2017 discussion paper, previously marketed LDTs would not be expected to comply with most or all FDA oversight requirements (grandfathering), except for adverse event and malfunction reporting. In addition, certain new and significantly modified LDTs would not be expected to comply with pre-market review unless the agency determines certain tests could lead to patient harm. Since LDTs currently on the market would be grandfathered in, pre-market review of new and significantly modified LDTs could be phased-in over a four-year period, as opposed to the nine years proposed in the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance. In addition, tests introduced after the effective date, but before their phase-in date, could continue to be offered during pre-market review.

The discussion paper notes that FDA will focus on analytical and clinical validity as the basis for marketing authorization. The FDA anticipates laboratories that already conduct proper validation should not be expected to experience new costs for validating their tests to support marketing authorization and laboratories that conduct appropriate evaluations would not have to collect additional data to demonstrate analytical validity for FDA clearance or approval. The evidence of the analytical and clinical validity of all LDTs will be made publically available. LDTs are encouraged to submit prospective change protocols in their pre-market submission that outline specific types of anticipated changes, the procedures that will be followed to implement them and the criteria that will be met prior to implementation.
 
Despite the FDA decision to not release the guidance at this time, it can choose to regulate LDTs at any time. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, such as fines, product suspensions, warning letters, recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions. There are other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general FDA oversight of clinical laboratories and LDTs. The outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the business is difficult to predict at this time. We are monitoring developments and anticipate that our products will be able to comply with requirements if ultimately imposed by the FDA. In the meantime, we maintain our CLIA certification of accreditation, which permits the use of LDTs for diagnostics purposes.
 
Healthcare, Fraud, Abuse and Anti-Kickback Laws
 
The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it a felony for a person or entity, including a laboratory, to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any Federal healthcare program. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may result in imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 for each offense in the case of individuals and $500,000 for each offense in the case of organizations. Convictions under the Anti-Kickback Statute result in mandatory exclusion from federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. In addition, HHS has the authority to impose civil assessments and fines and to exclude healthcare providers and others engaged in prohibited activities from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Actions, which violate the Anti-Kickback Statute, also incur liability under the Federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below, which prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. Government.
 
Although the Anti-Kickback Statute applies only to federal healthcare programs, a number of states have passed statutes substantially similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits similar conduct toward all other health plans and third-party payers. Federal and state law enforcement authorities scrutinize arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to induce patient care referrals or induce the purchase or prescribing of particular products or services. The law enforcement authorities, the courts and Congress have also demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and actual or potential referral sources. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-Kickback Statute, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases.
 
In addition to the requirements discussed above, several other healthcare fraud and abuse laws could have an effect on our business. For example, provisions of the Social Security Act permit Medicare and Medicaid to exclude an entity that charges the federal healthcare programs substantially in excess of its usual charges for its services. The terms “usual charge” and “substantially in excess” are ambiguous and subject to varying interpretations. Further, the Federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below, prohibits a person from knowingly submitting a claim, making a false record or statement in order to secure payment or retaining an overpayment by the federal government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. Finally, the Social Security Act includes its own provisions that prohibit the filing of false claims or submitting false statements in order to obtain payment. Violation of these provisions may result in fines, imprisonment or both, and possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid programs.

We are also subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law. These restrictions generally prohibit us from billing a patient or any governmental or private payer for any diagnostic services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician’s immediate family, has an investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition.
 
Persons or entities found to violate the Stark Law are required to refund any payments received pursuant to a referral prohibited by these laws to the patient, the payer or the Medicare program, as applicable. Sanctions for a violation of the Stark Law include the following:
 

● | denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law; 
● | a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral; 
● | possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and 
● | a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibition. 

 
These prohibitions apply regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. No finding of intent to violate the Stark Law is required for a violation. In addition, knowing violations of the Stark Law may also serve as the basis for liability under the Federal False Claims Act.
 
We do retain healthcare practitioners as key opinion leaders providing consultation in various aspects of the business. These arrangements as any arrangement that includes compensation to a healthcare provider may trigger Federal or State anti-kickback and Stark Law liability. Our arrangements are designed to meet available safe harbors and exceptions provided in the anti-kickback laws and Stark laws, respectively. There is no guarantee that the government will find that these arrangements are designed properly or that they do not trigger liability. Under existing laws, all arrangements must have a legitimate purpose and compensation must be fair market value. These terms require some subjective analysis and there is limited available case law or guidance for the application of these laws to the CLIA Laboratory industry. Safe harbors in the anti-kickback laws do not necessarily equate to exceptions in the Stark Law; and there is no guarantee that the government will not have issue with the relationships between the laboratories and the healthcare providers.
 
HIPAA, Fraud and Privacy Regulations
 
The Federal government’s efforts to combat fraud in the healthcare setting were consolidated and strengthened under Public Law 104-191, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. HIPAA established a comprehensive program to combat fraud committed against all health plans, both public and private by, among other things creating two new Federal offenses: healthcare fraud (18 U.S. Code § 1347) and false statements relating to healthcare matters (18 U.S. Code § 1035). These provisions prohibit: (1) the knowing and willful execution, or attempted execution, of a scheme or artifice (a) to defraud any healthcare benefit program (including private payers), or (b) to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services; and (2) the knowing and willful (a) falsification, concealment or covering up of a material fact by any trick, scheme or device, or (b) making of any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of these provisions is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion from government-sponsored programs.

HIPAA, along with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and the various regulations promulgated thereunder, also establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, which are referred to as “covered entities.” The regulations promulgated under HIPAA govern: the Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, restricting the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information (45 C.F.R. §§ 164.500, et seq.); Administrative Requirements for electronic transactions, establishing standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures (45 C.F.R. §§ 162.100, et seq.); Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information, requiring covered entities to implement and maintain certain security measures to safeguard certain electronic health information (45 C.F.R. §§ 164.302, et seq.); and Breach Notification, requiring covered entities and their business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information (45 C.F.R. §§ 164.400, et seq.). As a covered entity, and also in our capacity as a business associate to certain of our customers, we are subject to these standards. While the government intended this legislation to reduce administrative expenses and burdens for the healthcare industry, our compliance with certain provisions of these standards entails significant costs for us, and our failure to comply could lead to enforcement action that could have an adverse effect on our business. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA or its implementing regulations, we may be subject to potentially significant penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines.
 
In addition to Federal regulations issued under HIPAA, many States and foreign jurisdictions have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent laws. If we fail to comply with applicable State laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions.
 
Third Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Our customers’ bills are paid by many different payer groups. The majority of reimbursement dollars for traditional laboratory services are provided by traditional commercial insurance products, most notably preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, and other managed care plans, as well as government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. PPOs, HMOs and other managed care plans typically contract with a limited number of laboratories and then designate the laboratory or laboratories to be used for tests ordered by participating physicians. We are currently an out-of-network provider with most payers, which means we do not have a contract with payers to pay a specific rate for our tests. We did announce during 2017 a new national agreement with Aetna through which the Company is now an in-network provider for Aetna’s members. We are subject to applicable State laws regarding who should be billed, how they should be billed, how business should be conducted, and how patient obligations regarding cost sharing should be handled. In addition, if we become an “in-network” provider for certain payers in the future, we will also be subject to the terms of contracts (which could include reduced reimbursement rates) and may be subject to discipline, breach of contract actions, non-renewal or other contractually provided remedies for non-compliance with the contract’s requirements and/or applicable laws.
 
We generally bill third-party payers and individual patients for testing services on a test-by-test basis. Third-party payers include Medicare, private insurance companies, institutional direct clients and Medicaid, each of which has different billing requirements. Medicare reimbursement programs are complex and often ambiguous, and are continuously being evaluated and modified by CMS. Our ability to receive timely reimbursements from third-party payers is dependent on our ability to submit accurate and complete billing statements, and/or correct and complete missing and incorrect billing information. Missing and incorrect information on reimbursement submissions slows down the billing process and increases the aging of accounts receivable. We must bill Medicare directly for tests performed for Medicare patients and must accept Medicare’s fee schedule for the covered tests as payment in full. State Medicaid programs are generally prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule. Our Pittsburgh and New Haven laboratories have contracted with a healthcare billing services management company to work with our in-house staff and help manage our third-party billing.

Some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers, and there are several other factors that complicate billing (e.g., disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers; and incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians). In 2017 several private payers implemented pre-authorization requirements for molecular and genetic testing, including Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield and United Healthcare. In addition, more commercial payers are contracting with and delegating risk for lab services costs to Lab Benefits Management companies (e.g. Evicore, AIM Specialty Health, LBS/Beacon). This requires us to go through their technology assessment process to secure coverage and obtain a contract as an in-network lab provider for our services. We incur additional costs as a result of our participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs because diagnostic testing services are subject to complex, stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations, including those relating to coverage, billing and reimbursement. Additionally, auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process. Further, our billing systems require significant technology investment and, as a result of marketplace demands, we need to continually invest in our billing systems. Changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing expense. CMS establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process and requirements for coverage.
 
As an integral part of our billing compliance program, we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with Federal and State healthcare reimbursement requirements. Any Medicare or Medicaid overpayments are reimbursed by us. As a result of these efforts, we have periodically identified and reported overpayments, reimbursed the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action.
 
Historically, due to the nature of our business, we have performed requested testing and have reported test results regardless of collectability or form of reimbursement. We submit claims for reimbursement on a best efforts basis including the use of a third-party revenue cycle management firm. If at times the billing information is incorrect or incomplete, we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information. Missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process and may also impact revenue recognition. The increased use of electronic ordering reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information, and we are seeking to electronically integrate with more and more payers and clients. During 2017 we successfully implemented numerous electronic interfaces with providers to expedite the ordering and reporting process and increased the number of clients interacting with us via our customer portal.
 
There are a number of factors that influence coverage and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic tests. In the United States, the American Medical Association assigns specific CPT codes, which are necessary for reimbursement of molecular diagnostic tests. Once the CPT code is established, CMS establishes reimbursement payment levels and coverage rules under Medicaid and Medicare, and private payers establish rates and coverage rules independently. However, the availability of a CPT code is not a guarantee of coverage or adequate reimbursement levels, and the revenues generated from our tests will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payers provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels.
 
United States and other government regulations governing coverage and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing may affect, directly or indirectly, the design of our tests and the potential market for their use. The availability of third-party reimbursement for our tests and services may be limited or uncertain. Third-party payers may deny coverage if they determine that the tests or service has not received appropriate FDA or other government regulatory clearances, is not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by the payer, or is deemed by the third-party payer to be experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. Furthermore, third-party payers, including Federal and State healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations, frequently challenge the prices, medical necessity, and cost-effectiveness of healthcare products and services, including laboratory tests. Such payers may limit coverage of our tests to specific, limited circumstances, may not provide coverage at all, or may not provide adequate reimbursement rates, if covered. Further, one payer’s determination to provide coverage does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the test. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to maintain our revenue and growth. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.

Government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have taken steps and are expected to continue to take steps to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services, including clinical test services. For example, Medicare has adopted policies under which it does not pay for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the test. Physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they order clinical tests for Medicare and Medicaid patients.
 
Currently, Medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a co-payment for diagnostic information services reimbursed under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. Certain Medicaid programs require Medicaid recipients to pay co-payment amounts for diagnostic information services.
 
The Medicare Part B program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients, including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local Medicare clinical testing fee schedules. Historically, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, has been subject to change. In April 2014, the President signed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which included a substantial new payment system for clinical laboratory tests under the CLFS. PAMA removed CMS’s authority to adjust the CLFS based and established a new method for setting CLFS rates. Implementation of this new method for setting CLFS rates began in 2017. Under PAMA, laboratories that have more than $12,500 in Medicare revenues from laboratory services and that receive more than 50 percent of their Medicare revenues from laboratory services would report private payer data from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, to CMS between January 1, 2017 and March 31, 2017. CMS posted the new Medicare CLFS rates (based on weighted median private payer rates) in November 2017 and the new rates became effective on January 1, 2018. The result of the PAMA calculations was an increase in our reimbursement rate for ThyGenX of approximately 40% for our Medicare volume. Any reductions to payment rates resulting from the new methodology are limited to 10% per test per year in each of the years 2017 through 2019 and to 15% per test per year in each of the years 2020 through 2022. CMS has issued draft regulations regarding these changes. Further rule-making from CMS will define the time period and data elements evaluated on an annual basis to set reimbursement rates. Other than our chemistry testing services, our products are defined as Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Tests (ADLTs) and therefore, we believe the pricing provisions of PAMA do not affect our marketed molecular diagnostic tests. The only testing for which we bill that is included in the CLFS is our carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and Amylase chemistry testing services. For these services, we provided CMS with the median pricing received from all payers in compliance with PAMA regulations.
 
Penalties for violations of laws relating to billing government healthcare programs and for violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws include: (1) exclusion from participation in Medicare/Medicaid programs; (2) asset forfeitures; (3) civil and criminal fines and penalties; and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business. Civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations may be assessed on a per violation basis. A parallel civil remedy under the federal False Claims Act provides for penalties on a per violation basis, plus damages of up to three times the amount claimed.
 
Historically, most Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs administered by the federal government. Reimbursement from traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs represented approximately 38% of our consolidated net revenues during 2017. Over the last several years, the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for Medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs, called “Medicare Advantage” programs. There has been growth of health insurance providers offering Medicare Advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs. Commercial health plans that might not cover one or all of our tests for their commercially insured members are required to follow the Novitas LCD coverage policy for their Medicare Advantage members. To the extent we maintain the LCD coverage policies with Novitas for our products, any shift of members from traditional Medicare to Medicare Advantage plans doesn’t represent a risk of lost revenue. In recent years, in an effort to control costs, states also have mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements.
 
The current position of the laboratories is that they do not meet the definition of an “Applicable Manufacturer” under Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA (also known as the Affordable Care Act) and therefore are not subject to the disclosure or tax requirements contained in PPACA. However, as new regulations are implemented and diagnostic tests reclassified, this may change and the laboratory business may be subject to PPACA as are other companies. There is no guarantee that our interpretation of the law is now or will be in the future consistent with government guidance and interpretation.
