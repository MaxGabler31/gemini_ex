Company Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company currently focused on the discovery and development of innovative product candidates derived from our unique and proprietary, lipid-crystal nano-particle, or cochleate, delivery technology platform. Our proprietary cochleate delivery technology platform, licensed from Rutgers University on an exclusive worldwide basis, nano-encapsulates drugs and is designed to make these drugs orally bioavailable, well-tolerated and safe while providing intracellular delivery. We believe the ability of our drug delivery technology to efficiently deliver drugs intracellularly may result in the targeted and safe delivery of pharmaceuticals directly to the site of infection or inflammation as well as the potential to treat a variety of cell-based pathogens, diseases and conditions. We believe our cochleate technology provides us with a highly stable, safe, efficient and broadly applicable drug delivery platform, with particular utility in diseases and conditions in which the immune system plays a significant modulation role and where the immune system facilitates the active transport of our lipid crystal nano-particles throughout the body.
 
Currently, we are focused on leveraging our cochleate, delivery technology platform in developing our own products within the anti-infective space and on identifying strategic partners whose drug candidates and molecules, in combination with our delivery technology, present the greatest value and innovation while addressing significant markets of unmet medical need.


We believe initially focusing on the anti-infective market has distinct advantages for the development of products, including:
 

● | a current regulatory environment which provides small development and clinical stage companies incentives such as significant periods of regulatory marketing exclusivity and opportunities to reduce development cost and timeline to market for anti-infective drug candidates that fill specific needs; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | traditional high correlation between efficacy and safety data in preclinical animal models and the outcome of human clinical trials with anti-infective product candidates, particularly for systemic disease; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | attractive commercial opportunities for anti-infective products differentiated in safety profile, mode of action and oral bioavailability positioned against current therapies with significant side effects, or drug -drug interactions, and intravenous delivery resulting in lack of convenience, compliance and at a significant burden to the cost of healthcare. 

Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes, either ourselves or through a strategic partner, novel anti-infective medicines using our proprietary cochleate delivery platform technology. Key elements of our strategy include:

● | Rapidly advance our lead antifungal product candidate, MAT2203, through a focused and streamlined clinical development program to obtain regulatory approval in areas of demonstrated unmet medical need supported by significant regulatory exclusivity. We plan to leverage the current regulatory environment for anti-infectives that address specific needs, to expedite the development of MAT2203. We have completed two Phase 2 clinical trials with MAT2203 and recently met with the FDA to review our overall data package and further development plans for MAT2203. We are planning a Phase 2 adaptive design clinical trial with the goal of generating PK/PD, efficacy, and safety data necessary to support a limited use indication for the prevention of invasive fungal infections in ALL patients, an area where there currently exists no approved prevention alternatives. If approved for use in this indication, MAT2203 would be eligible for 12 years of product exclusivity afforded through FDA designation as a QIDP and Orphan drug product;

● | Invest in our cochleate lipid-crystal nanoparticle delivery platform. We believe that our unique and proprietary cochleate lipid-crystal delivery platform has broad potential applications across a wide spectrum of compounds and therapeutic areas and is differentiated from any other lipid nanoparticle delivery system available today. Important data has already been generated with our delivery system and other compounds and molecules including antivirals, vaccines (including the influenza vaccine), oligonucleotides (such as mRNA and siRNAs) and anti-inflammatory agents (such as NSAIDs). We intend to invest the resources necessary to better understand and characterize the superiority of our delivery platform and are in the process of evaluating several potential strategic collaborations to advance our platform technology in areas of innovative medicine. Furthermore, we expect to continue to establish important intellectual property related to this platform, its applications and development candidates. 
● | Develop and grow our ability to formulate and manufacture products utilizing our proprietary delivery platform technology. We have made significant investments in establishing our own cGMP facility in order to supply products for clinical development of our product candidates. With these facilities, we have also taken steps to improve the formulations for our product candidates which we believe could provide greater efficacy, safety and patient compliance. We plan to continue to invest in maintaining and potentially expanding our manufacturing capacity for cGMP production in preparation for commercial production in an effort to retain exclusive knowledge of the process and intellectual property associated with our platform delivery technology; 
● | Advance our lead anti-bacterial product candidate MAT2501, based on available resources, with a goal of improving the formulation of MAT2501 in order to broaden the therapeutic application and opportunity associated with the potentially first orally-available aminoglycoside supported by significant regulatory exclusivity. In May 2017 we completed and announced topline results from our first Phase 1 single escalating dose clinical trial of MAT2501 in healthy volunteers in which no serious adverse events were reported and where oral administration of MAT2501 at all tested doses yielded blood levels well below the safety levels recommended for injected amikacin. Prior to commencing our next clinical study with MAT2501 we plan to complete formulation enhancement and preclinical studies to optimize MAT2501 for success in the treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterium as well as other bacterial infections where there is significant unmet medical need due to increasing resistance to available therapies and lack of innovation.

Our Anti-Infective Product Candidates
 
MAT2203 and MAT2501
 
We have leveraged our platform cochleate delivery technology to develop two clinical-stage products that we believe have the potential to become best-in-class drugs. Our lead product candidate MAT2203 is an orally-administered cochleate formulation of a broad spectrum anti-fungal drug called amphotericin B. We are initially developing MAT2203 for the prevention of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) due to immunosuppressive therapy in patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). In 2017 and early 2018, we completed and announced data from two separate Phase 2 clinical trials involving MAT2203; and we are positioning this product and planning a Phase 2/3 adaptive design clinical trial in certain leukemia patients seeking a limited indication approval in patients with ALL, which is expected to commence in the first half of 2019.
 
Our second clinical stage product candidate is MAT2501, an orally administered, cochleate formulation of the broad spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic amikacin which may be used to treat different types of multidrug-resistant bacteria, including non-tuberculous mycobacterium infections (NTM), as well as various multidrug-resistant gram negative and intracellular bacterial infections. In May 2017, we completed and announced topline results from a Phase 1 single escalating dose clinical trial of MAT2501 in healthy volunteers in which no serious adverse events were reported and where oral administration of MAT2501 at all tested doses yielded blood levels that were well below the safety levels recommended for injected amikacin, supporting further development of MAT2501 for the treatment of NTM infections.
 
MAT2203
 
Product Profile
 
MAT2203 is an orally-administered, cochleate formulation of amphotericin B (a broad spectrum fungicidal agent). Little to no clinical resistance has been reported to date with amphotericin B as compared to the rapidly emerging drug resistance seen in other antifungal therapies. Currently, IV-only administered amphotericin B is the only broad spectrum fungicidal; however, it has significant treatment-limiting side effects, most notably nephrotoxicity. The ability to provide amphotericin B orally using our proprietary and novel oral formulation may offer a new and promising alternative for patients and doctors. In a clinical Phase 1 single-dose, double-blind, dose-escalating, pharmacokinetic study of 48 healthy volunteers, oral MAT2203 demonstrated a good safety and tolerability profile with no serious adverse events reported, without any observed nephrotoxicity. More recently, in our Phase 2 trial of MAT2203 conducted by the National Institutes of Health, three of three enrolled patients met their primary efficacy endpoint and two of these patients have been successfully taking MAT2203 for more than a year with no evidence of kidney or other toxicity frequently associated with the use of amphotericin B.
Antifungal Market Opportunity
 
The overall global antifungal market accounted for $10.7 billion in 2015 with estimated annual worldwide sales of prescription systemic antifungal drugs reaching approximately $4 billion. This includes therapies used as active treatment or prophylaxis (preventative) in the inpatient and outpatient setting, therapies used for the treatment of hospitalized patients and therapies used for the treatment of patients who are being discharged from the hospital. We estimate that, each year, there are over 1.5 million cases of invasive fungal infections caused by various species of Candida, Aspergillus and Cryptococcus, the three most common invasive fungal pathogens, globally. The estimated incidence in the U.S. for these conditions is approximately 46,000 for invasive candidiasis, 6,000 for invasive aspergillosis, and 3,000 for cryptococcal meningitis. The rapid progression of disease and high mortality rates (20% - 50%) associated with documented invasive fungal infections often result in antifungal therapy being administered in suspected (unconfirmed) cases or as a preventative measure in patients at high risk. Also, the increasingly widespread use of immune suppressive drugs as cancer chemotherapy or for organ transplantation or treatment of autoimmune disease has resulted in an increasing population of patients at risk for invasive fungal infections. Furthermore, the limited number of systemic antifungal drug classes, consisting of azoles, echinocandins and polyenes, and their extensive use, has led to increased numbers of infections with drug-resistant strains. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed fluconazole-resistant Candida as a serious threat requiring prompt and sustained action and has also identified a rise in echinocandin resistance, especially among Candida glabrata. In June 2016, the CDC issued an extraordinary alert for healthcare facilities and providers to be on the lookout for patients with Candida auris, a multidrug resistant strain with high mortality (approximately 60%). Almost half of C. auris isolates are multidrug resistant to two or more antifungal classes (large majority resistant to fluconazole, 40% resistant to echinocandins). We believe this underscores the urgent need for new agents with activity against resistant strains and that be administered with significant less toxicity and the potential to discharge patients earlier to reduce hospital stays and costs.

The following is a discussion of serious fungal infections and the limitations of the current treatments for each:
 

● | Invasive Candidiasis is a serious fungal infection that occurs in immunocompromised patients. Current treatment guidelines in the U.S. and in Europe recommend the use of echinocandins (the only glucan synthase inhibitor currently commercially available) as the initial first-line therapy for invasive candidiasis. The main limitation of the echinocandin class is that only IV administration is available, limiting the flexibility of stepping down to an oral therapy in the same treatment class. The ability to step down to an oral therapy is important because it allows patients to be discharged from the hospital. The only currently available option for oral step down therapy are the azoles (the only class orally bioavailable). The azoles have been associated with an increased frequency of resistant isolates, and risk of drug-drug interactions and toxicities; thus creating a gap in optimal treatment options for patients that could benefit from an orally administered effective antifungal agent. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Invasive Aspergillosis is a serious fungal infection that occurs in immunocompromised patients. Current treatment guidelines in the U.S. and in Europe recommend the use of azoles (itraconazole, voriconazole or isavuconazole) as the initial first-line therapy for invasive aspergillosis. The main limitation of the azole class is that it is associated with increased risk of drug-drug interactions and toxicities, thus creating a gap in optimal treatment options for patients that could benefit from an orally administered safe and effective antifungal agent. The sub-optimal toxicity profile of the azoles has a greater impact for invasive aspergillosis patients given that they typically receive antifungal therapy for long durations (up to four months). 
● | The incidence of hematologic malignancies has become a driver of the invasive fungal infection (IFI) rate in the U.S. According to estimates by the American Cancer Society in 2018, approximately 175,000 new hematologic malignancy cases occur every year, resulting in approximately 58,000 deaths. The percentage of patients with hematologic malignancies who develop IFI has increased dramatically in recent decades. This increase of the IFI rate is attributed to host defense impairment due to more intensive use of cytotoxic chemotherapies, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), ablative radiation therapy, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and new immunosuppressive agents. Candida species have been the main cause of IFI, but recent autopsy and epidemiological findings indicate that an increasing number of infections are being caused by molds. Most are attributed to Aspergillus species, and such infections have become a prime cause of death in patients with hematologic malignancies.

IFI in immunosuppressed patients is a source of significant mortality and represents an area of critical unmet medical need. The incidence of IFI in immunosuppressed patients is increasing and mortality rates remain high, despite advances in antifungal treatment. A new or improved broad-spectrum antifungal therapy with a favorable safety profile, fewer drug to drug interactions and a more convenient route of delivery is needed for the prevention of IFI in immunosuppressed patients.
 
Our Solution – MAT2203
 
Our lead anti-infective product candidate, MAT2203, is an application of our cochleate delivery technology to a broad spectrum anti-fungal drug called amphotericin B. Amphotericin B is an IV administered drug used as a last resort for treatment of systemic fungal infections resistant to triazoles and echinocandins, including resistant candidiasis, cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, and aspergillosis. To date, there have been little to no reports of clinically observed drug-resistance to amphotericin B, further bolstering the use of this compound as the most likely last resort treatment for fungal infections in the foreseeable future. However, the use of amphotericin B is relatively limited because it is currently only available as an IV-administered product and has documented history of severe toxicity (most notably nephrotoxicity). Encapsulating the amphotericin B drug with our cochleate delivery technology provides a potential opportunity for the drug to be taken orally with targeted delivery to infected cells, which we believe may have fewer side effects than the currently available IV-formulations of amphotericin B. Encochleation of amphotericin B changes the bio-distribution, resulting in a higher level of the drug at the site of infection and a lower level of circulating amphotericin B. By reducing the amount of circulating drug, cochleates may reduce overall toxicity. Importantly, drug concentrations will be high only in tissues due to the migratory nature of macrophages to inflammatory regions. We believe MAT2203 may offer improved safety and reduced toxicity and, as a result, we believe MAT2203 will be able to offer a categorically different formulation that delivers orally administered amphotericin B, directly to the target cell at the site of infection. A similar distribution pattern has been described for azithromycin where in vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated that azithromycin is taken up, transported and released at the sites of infection by phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. This then leads to rapid distribution into the tissue and high concentrations within cells which yields significantly higher azithromycin concentration in tissue than in plasma or serum.
 
We believe that MAT2203 has the potential to be a best-in-class therapy for both prophylaxis (preventive) and treatment of invasive fungal infections by offering the following key benefits.
 

- 6 -
-----


● | Potential to treat resistant pathogens. We believe that MAT2203 can be used to prevent and treat fungal infections caused by drug resistant fungi, including those resistant to existing azoles and echinocandins, due to amphotericin B’s fungicidal (i.e. killing the fungi) nature and potency against resistant strains and the ability of our cochleate drug delivery platform to provide higher and safer drug exposure early in the course of therapy. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Enabling prophylaxis regimens. Many patients cannot receive azole prophylactic therapy due to drug-drug interactions or poor tolerability, while the long-term preventative use (6-14 weeks) of IV echinocandins is impractical and expensive. Importantly, elevated doses of echinocandin therapy has been demonstrated to result in increased rapid resistance. Amphotericin B is known to have limited no drug-drug interactions. We therefore expect that our orally available MAT2203 could provide for better prophylactic therapy on an inpatient and outpatient basis, particularly for those patients with a hematologic malignancy, such as leukemia and in the case of ALL, the only approved preventative therapy for deadly invasive fungal infections. 
● | Shorter and less costly hospital stays and lower outpatient costs. By providing physicians and patients with access to an orally available, broad spectrum fungicidal agent in MAT2203, there is the potential to reduce hospital costs, which account for over 70% of the overall treatment cost of invasive candidiasis. 

 
The FDA has granted MAT2203 designations for Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, and Fast Track for the treatment of invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis and for the prevention of IFIs in patients on immunosuppressive therapy. We have also applied for Orphan Drug Designation for MAT2203. The orphan drug designation provides eligibility for seven years of market exclusivity in the United States upon FDA approval, a waiver from payment of user fees, an exemption from performing clinical studies in pediatric patients, and tax credits for the cost of the clinical research. The QIDP designation, provided under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act, offers certain incentives for the development of new antibacterial or antifungal drugs, including eligibility for Fast Track designation, priority review and, if approved by the FDA, eligibility for an additional five years of marketing exclusivity. Fast Track designation enables more frequent interactions with FDA to expedite drug development and review. Fast Track designation does not change the standards for approval and we can provide no assurances that we can maintain Fast Track designation for MAT2203 or that such designation will result in faster regulatory review. The seven-year period of marketing exclusivity provided through orphan designation, if granted, combined with an additional five years of marketing exclusivity provided by the QIDP designation positions MAT2203 with a potential for a total of 12 years of marketing exclusivity to be granted at the time of FDA approval.
 
Development History of MAT2203 and Initial Target Indication
 
MAT2203 was studied in animal model studies of various fungal infections including invasive candidiasis, aspergillosis and cryptococcal meningitis.
 
The data from animal studies for MAT2203, our cochleate lipid-crystal nano-particle formulation of amphotericin B, indicate a side-effect advantage over other amphotericin B formulations, which we believe is based on two phenomena:

● | The lipid-crystal nano-particle is a solid particle, and does not significantly “leak” its drug content while circulating. The particle releases its medication pay-load only when inside the target cells, and thus appears that the use of MAT2203 does not result in toxicities normally seen in the kidneys when using current formulations of amphotericin B. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Because of this targeted approach, we have been able to increase the therapeutic window on a mg/kg basis as compared to IV amphotericin B formulations. We have observed equivalent efficacy at lower doses as well as been able to use oral doses of up to 10x the highest tolerable IV dose in animal model studies. 


- 7 -
-----

 

An IND application for MAT2203 was filed with the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in late 2006. In a clinical Phase 1a single-dose, double-blind, dose-escalating, pharmacokinetic (PK) study of 48 healthy volunteers MAT2203 demonstrated a good safety and tolerability profile with no serious adverse events reported.
 
We are pursuing a first indication for the prevention of invasive fungal infections in patients with ALL because the risk for invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in patients being treated for ALL is high, with an associated high risk of lethality. Currently, there is no standard of care for preventing these high risk IFIs in ALL patients. The established treatment regimens for ALL are highly sensitive to liver-metabolized drug-drug interactions, causing serious concerns for drug-drug interaction induced side-effects. Amphotericin B is not liver metabolized and when incorporated in the lipid-crystal nano-particle structure of MAT2203, this otherwise toxic IV only compound can now be safely orally administered (providing patient convenience over ~12 weeks prophylactic treatment duration), without the typical kidney and liver toxicity associated with other Amphotericin B formulations.
 
Clinical Data and Clinical Development Plan for MAT2203 – Phase 2
 
NIH-Conducted Study


In early June 2017, we reported interim data from the NIH-Conducted Phase 2a Clinical Study of Orally-Administered MAT2203 for the Treatment of Chronic Refractory Mucocutaneous Candidiasis. At that time, two out of the two patients with long-standing azole resistant mucocutaneous candidiasis met the primary endpoint of the Phase 2a study, achieving ≥ 50% clinical response with treatment of MAT2203. Patient #01 achieved a 57% reduction in clinical symptoms after 8 weeks on therapy while patient #02 achieved an 85% reduction in such clinical symptoms after 6 weeks of treatment. MAT2203 was well tolerated with majority of adverse events observed being mild in severity and mostly unrelated to study drug. Importantly, for both patients renal and liver function parameters remained well within normal ranges during the core study as well as during the first 6-month extension of this study. In July 2017, the NIH/NIAID institutional review board approved continuation of treatment of patients in the study-extension for an additional 6 months, for total extension of up to one year.
 
In January 2018, the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) reported positive data from a third patient enrolled in this study. This third patient, with long-standing azole resistant mucocutaneous candidiasis, met the primary endpoint of the Phase 2a study in achieving ≥ 50% clinical response with treatment of MAT2203. MAT2203 was well tolerated with any adverse events observed being mild in severity and unrelated to study drug. With this third positive response, the study has met its statistical hurdle for success. The third patient in this study was diagnosed with a dual Candida albicans and C. glabrata infection with azole resistance. The predominant manifestation was esophageal candidiasis, which had been refractory to treatment for a prolonged period. Patient 3 achieved a reduction in clinical symptoms at an efficacious orally administered dosage of 800 mg MAT2203 per day, meeting the response criterium of ≥ 50% reduction in clinical symptoms. MAT2203 was generally well tolerated by Patient 3 and there were no signs of nephrotoxicity, hypokalemia or hepatoxicity (measured by ALT and AST). Indicators of kidney and liver toxicity remained within normal limits throughout the treatment period. For this patient, no underlying immunocompromising condition was diagnosed. Patients 1 and 2, both with an underlying hereditary immunodeficiency called Job’s Syndrome, also known as Autosomal Dominant Hyper IgE Syndrome (AD-HIES), enrolled earlier in this trial and achieved reduction in clinical symptoms of 57% (at 800mg/day) and 85% (at 400mg/day). The first two patients have enrolled in a long-term study extension and have shown no signs of kidney or liver toxicity over the approximately twelve months of being administered MAT2203. Furthermore, the clinical response to MAT2203 seen in these patients has been maintained and/or improved during the extension period in addition to patients reporting meaningful quality-of-life improvements. This third patient has also enrolled in the long-term study extension.
 
VVC Study
 
In late June 2017, we announced the topline data from our Phase 2 study in Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC) using MAT2203. In the context of our overall program for MAT2203 with the aim to develop our lead product for the prevention of invasive fungal infections in patients who are immunocompromised due to immunosuppressive therapy, our goal was, in addition to further establishing the safety and tolerability of MAT2203, to demonstrate efficacy of MAT2203 through a mechanism involving systemic absorption in a non-life threatening fungal infection. This study concept is consistent with early human efficacy studies in the development of other anti- fungal therapies. This Phase 2 study was not designed or powered to support an indication for the treatment of VVC and therefore supplant fluconazole as the standard of care. The key data generated from this study includes additional safety and tolerability data.

-----

 

In this VVC study, the primary endpoint of safety was met, and it was demonstrated that oral delivery of encochleated amphotericin B is safe and well tolerated without the renal and hepatic toxicities that can be seen with administration of intravenous amphotericin B. Drug-related treatment emergent adverse events in this study were mostly of mild and gastro-intestinal nature and were seen at a rate of 20%, 18% and 2% respectively for MAT2203 200mg, MAT2203 400mg, and fluconazole. Consistent with the safety observations in the NIH study, in this VVC study no drug-related effects on liver function were observed and kidney function parameters stayed within normal ranges during the entire study for all 91 patients treated with MAT2203 for 5 days.


Development Plan


In January 2018, we had a meeting with FDA at which the focus was our clinical development and toxicology plans for MAT2203 in Phase 2 and Phase 3 in support of an NDA submission for approval in prevention of invasive fungal infections in patients with ALL. We are planning on conducting a Phase 2 trial using an adaptive trial design which we believe will position MAT2203 for approval with a limited indication for prevention of invasive fungal infections in ALL patients. We are in the process of conducting animal efficacy, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies and dynamic pharmacokinetic/pharmcodynamic modeling to establish the optimal dosing for our adaptive pivotal trial. We believe that by optimizing the dose and implementing this streamlined development plan, we could decrease the time and cost of our overall development program for MAT2203. We expect to be in position to commence a pivotal Phase 2 adaptive-designed study in the first half of 2019. The first aspect of this pivotal Phase 2 trial will be an evaluation of the PK/PD and tolerability of MAT2203 in patients with either ALL or AML. The second part of this study will evolve to become an evaluation of PK/PD, efficacy and safety of MAT2203 versus placebo in ALL patients alone, where there is no standard of care. We believe this overall development program will position MAT2203 for an initial, limited use approval indication for prevention of invasive fungal infections in ALL patients by 2022. Based on limited utility of currently approved antifungal therapies for the prevention of IFI due to significant drug-drug interactions or lack of oral dosing mode, we believe that our orally administered MAT2203 has the potential to become a highly differentiated therapy in the antifungal field upon FDA approval in the prevention of invasive fungal infections in patients with ALL.
MAT2501 – Targeting Chronic and Acute Bacterial Infections 
 
Product Profile
 
MAT2501, an orally-administered, encochleated formulation of the broad spectrum IV-only aminoglycoside antibiotic agent amikacin, utilizes our proprietary, lipid-crystal, nanoparticle delivery technology. Amikacin is currently used to treat different types of chronic and acute bacterial infections, including Non-Tuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) infections and various multidrug-resistant gram negative bacterial infections. IV-administered amikacin is associated with side effects including nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity (potential permanent loss of hearing). MAT2501 is specifically designed to provide targeted delivery of the potent antibiotic amikacin while providing an improved safety and tolerability profile. In preclinical studies MAT2501 demonstrated efficacy after oral bioavailability in murine models of both pulmonary (lung) and disseminated NTM infections. In May 2017, we announced results from our Phase 1 clinical study of MAT2501 in healthy volunteers. The FDA designated MAT2501 as a QIDP and an Orphan Drug for the treatment of NTM infections. We intend to initially develop MAT2501 for the treatment of NTM infections and are also exploring the development of MAT2501 for the treatment of multi-drug resistant, gram negative bacterial infections. If approved, we believe MAT2501 would become the first orally bioavailable aminoglycoside and represent a significant improvement over existing therapies from a treatment and health economic perspective.

NTM Market Opportunity
 
Nontuberculous mycobacteria are naturally occurring organisms found in water, soil, plants and animals. NTM causes many serious and life-threatening diseases, including pulmonary disease, skin and soft tissue disease, joint infections and, in immunocompromised individuals, disseminated infection. The most common clinical manifestation of NTM disease is pulmonary, or lung, disease. NTM lung infection occurs when a person inhales the organism from their environment. While most people do not become ill, some individuals develop a slow, progressive and destructive disease when NTM infects the airways and lung tissue leading to inflammation in the respiratory system. Individuals susceptible to the infection often have an unknown defect in their lung structure or immune system, lung damage from a pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as emphysema and bronchiectasis, or cystic fibrosis, or an immune deficiency disorder, such as HIV or AIDS.
 
There are about 50,000 to 90,000 people with NTM pulmonary disease in the United States, with a much higher frequency in older adults, and these numbers appear to be increasing. However, NTM can affect any age group. Without treatment, the progressive lung infection caused by NTM results in severe cough, fatigue, and often weight loss. In some people NTM infections can become chronic and require ongoing treatment. Treatment may be difficult because NTM bacteria may be resistant to many common types of antibiotics. Severe NTM lung disease can have a significant impact on quality of life and can be life-threatening in a manner similar to tuberculosis, a condition caused by related Mycobacterium species. There are no products specifically indicated for the treatment of pulmonary NTM disease in the U.S., Europe or Canada. Current guideline-based approaches involve multi-drug regimens that may cause severe side effects and treatments can be as long as two years or more. Importantly, as many as 40% of patients with NTM lung disease are refractory to the established 3-drug guideline treatment regimen, leaving a very significant unmet medical need.
 
MAT2501 is specifically designed to provide targeted delivery of the potent antibiotic amikacin while providing an improved safety and tolerability profile, in order to allow for chronic dosing of this potent antibiotic agent. FDA guidance for developing medications for the treatment of patients with of NTM infections refractory to guideline therapy includes a treatment duration in the range of 12 to 18 months. The profile of MAT2501 was designed to allow for safe and tolerable use of amikacin during such long-term treatment.
 
In addition to the treatment of NTM, we are also exploring the development MAT2501 for the treatment of certain multi-drug resistant, gram negative bacterial infections. If approved, we believe MAT2501 would become the first orally bioavailable aminoglycoside and represent a significant improvement over existing therapies in an area of significant unmet medical need.
 
Development History for MAT2501
 
In preclinical studies MAT2501 demonstrated efficacy after oral administration in murine models of both pulmonary (lung) and disseminated NTM infections. MAT2501 also demonstrated efficacy in cell-based assays and studies in animals with both lung and disseminated Mycobacterium avium infections, the most prevalent organism causing NTM infections in humans. In May 2017, we announced additional positive efficacy results from the study of MAT2501 in an in vitro preclinical model of Mycobacterium abscessus. Mycobacterium abscessus, a species of multi-drug resistant nontuberculous mycobacteria, are emerging as an important global threat to individuals suffering from immunosuppression or with chronic disease, such as cystic fibrosis. Confirming these results using in vivo models will be an important step in the development of MAT2501 for the treatment of Mycobacterium abscessus. The positive results showing the efficacy of MAT2501 against Mycobacterium abscessus in an in vitro assay provide the required proof-of-concept (POC) validation needed to advance MAT2501 into further in vivo, preclinical animal studies. Planning and preparation for these preclinical POC animal studies are in progress and will be done concurrently with continued clinical development of MAT2501 for the treatment of NTM.
Clinical Development Plan for MAT2501 – Phase 1
 
We are currently developing MAT2501 for the treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infections. We believe the most significant unmet medical need in this field is in patients with NTM lung disease which is refractory to the 3-drug IDSA guideline regimen. Our primary development goal is to obtain an indication for the treatment of patients with NTM lung disease refractory to standard guideline therapy.

Although several companies are developing inhaled anti-infective therapies for this use, we believe a significant unmet medical need remains due to the side-effects and lack of longer-term tolerability of such inhaled therapies. We believe our oral delivery technology allows for a highly differentiated and more convenient administration mode for patients who cannot be cured with the currently established therapeutic approach. We have established proof of principle of our oral dosing regimen in several pre-clinical studies of Mycobacterium avium infections in murine models of disseminated and lung-biofilm infections, which have formed the basis of our IND filing and subsequent QIDP and Orphan Drug designations for treatment of NTM infection by US FDA.
 
We have been supported by NIH funding through a preclinical services contract HHSN272201000009l for in-vitro screening of the activity of MAT2501 against other Mycobacterium species, including Mycobacterum abscessus. M. abscessus a more rapidly growing organism which is spreading at a disproportional higher rate as compared to other Mycobacterium species, is an area of increasing medical concern. Mycobacterium abscessus is also becoming a significant problem in patients with cosmetic and orthopaedic surgery. Based on this successful in-vitro screening work, we recently announced continuation of this work in animal studies, with the aim to establish the efficacy of MAT2501 in a broad range of Mycobacterium species. We have also been awarded a research contract by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) to assess the efficacy of MAT2501 in cystic fibrosis animal models with lung infections caused by a range of Mycobacterium species. The rapid spread of Mycobacterum abscessus in cystic fibrosis patients is also a significant medical concern. We are collaborating with investigators from Colorado State University on preclinical infection models of multiple mycobacterium strains supported by NIH and CFF.
 
In 2017, we announced topline results from our Phase 1 study with MAT2501. This Phase 1 study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study primarily aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MAT2501 in healthy adult subjects. Secondary aims of the study included the effects of food on tolerability and pharmacokinetics. There were no serious adverse events reported in the study. Adverse events were mostly mild in severity and gastrointestinal (GI) in nature, as seen with previous cochleate Phase 1 studies. The incidence of such adverse events was significantly decreased when administered with food. Oral administration of MAT2501 at all three doses yielded blood levels that were well below the safety levels recommended for IV administered amikacin. The results of this study support the further development of MAT2501 for the treatment of NTM infections.
 
Next, we plan to initiate a multiple-ascending dose Phase 1 study to characterize the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MAT2501 over a more extended period in a dosing regimen that resembles the envisioned clinical use of the product. Upon future FDA meetings, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in patients with NTM lung disease refractory to guideline therapy. We also plan to evaluate opportunities or need to conduct human drug to drug interaction studies and studies in special patient populations, such as patients with cystic fibrosis or non-lung Mycobacterum abscessus infections. Based on limited success and utility of inhaled therapies in these uses, as well as the oral dosing mode of our product, we believe that MAT2501 has the potential to become a highly differentiated therapy for the treatment of NTM if approved by FDA.
 
Our Cochleate Platform Delivery Technology
 
Cochleate lipid-crystal nano-particles are composed of simple, naturally occurring materials: phosphatidylserine (PS) and calcium. They are stable and have a unique multilayered structure consisting of a large, continuous, solid, lipid bilayer sheet rolled up in a spiral or as stacked sheets, with no internal aqueous space (Figure 1). This unique structure provides protection from degradation for “encochleated” molecules. Components within the interior of the cochleate remain intact, even though the outer layers of the cochleate may be exposed to harsh environmental conditions or enzymes.

- 11 -

Figure 1 Cochleate Formulation
 

The structure is formed when a series of solid lipid sheets engulf drug molecules, a process referred to as “encochleation.” Encochleation, developed by Matinas and Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, involves combining calcium and soy-derived PS, two naturally occurring materials classified as GRAS (generally recognized as safe), through a stirring process to envelop the active pharmacological ingredient. The result is a nano-size encochleated drug formulation (Figure 2).
Figure 2 Formation of Cochleate
 


Cochleates have been shown to improve existing drugs by providing 1) cell targeted delivery; 2) reduced blood levels thereby reducing toxicity; and 3) oral delivery of drugs now only available intravenously. Cochleates work by encapsulating molecules of drugs in a solid, anhydrous, crystalline structure, protecting them as they pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where they cross the mucous membrane. Once the cochleates have crossed the mucosal barrier of the GI tract into the lymphatic system, they are picked up by particle scavenging cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. (Figure 3). Activated macrophages, with drug-cochleate inside, migrate to the site of infection or to the target organ and deliver amphotericin B.

Figure 3 Macrophage Uptake of Cochleates
 


Cells in the mononuclear phagocytic system are immune cells that have the capacity to engulf and destroy numerous potentially pathogenic materials and organisms within the body. These cells are found in almost every site of the body, save a few ‘immune privileged’ sites (e.g. eyes, fetus, and testes). Such cells help with non-specific (innate) immune defenses as well as help initiate specific (adaptive) immune responses, thus they play a critical role bridging the gap between innate and adaptive immune responses. Our core capabilities combine the use of lipids as active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and the use of lipids in “cochleate-shaped” lipid-crystal nano-particle drug delivery vehicles. Therapeutic applications of our proprietary delivery technology are focused on the delivery of several potent and highly efficacious anti-fungal and anti-bacterial agents which, unfortunately, are currently still associated with serious side effects, including irreversible toxic effects on kidney and hearing function. Our technology may allow for the safe and targeted delivery of these agents, which positions us to be at the forefront of dealing with these very serious problems.
 
Our cochleate delivery technology is currently being used to encapsulate potent anti-infective drugs in tiny lipid-crystals which are selectively picked up by cells in the mononuclear phagocytic system, such as macrophages, and transported to infected cells. These tiny lipid crystals are referred to as “cochleates.” Cochleates have a multilayer crystalline, spiral structure with no internal aqueous space. The structure is formed when a series of solid lipid sheets roll up and engulf drug molecules in between the sheets, a proprietary process referred to as “encochleation”. The result is a lipid-crystal encochleated drug formulation made up of nano-sized particles. We believe our cochleate delivery technology provides an effective delivery mechanism without chemically bonding or otherwise altering the drug. Because the medications are locked in the particles, we believe the exposure to sensitive organs will be reduced, potentially resulting in reduced toxic effects. In summary, we believe this unique technology offers (1) targeted delivery, (2) decreased toxic effects, and (3) oral formulation (even for IV-only medications).
 
Multi-organ Protection: The key innovation of our cochleate delivery technology is our ability to package medication inside lipid-crystal particles without leaking. Because of their crystal nature, these particles are truly solid and hold on tightly to their medication pay-load. This is where the cochleate delivery technology differs markedly from other lipid-based delivery technology, such as liposomal delivery. Liposomes are liquid delivery systems which typically leak some of their drug content into our circulatory systems, thus still exposing our vulnerable organs and tissues to potential toxic effects. Keeping potentially organ-toxic medications inside the lipid-crystal particles strongly differentiates our cochleate delivery technology from other drug delivery approaches.

Targeted Delivery: The size of our individual cochleate lipid-crystals is typically in the range of 50-500 nm. This is very small and by comparison close to the size of a large virus or a small bacteria. Our body produces several cell-types that are designed to remove viruses and bacteria from our system. These cell types, such as macrophages, are part of our immune system and “swallow” the bacteria and viruses they encounter in order to protect us from infections. Because of the size our lipid-crystal cochleate particles and the phospholipid surface structure (the cell membranes of bacteria are also made up from phospholipids), macrophages tend to absorb these cochleate particles very well.
 
Oral Formulation: Many drugs that are currently on the market are only effective in treating diseases when administered via IV. For example, many anti-infective drugs must be administered via IV in order to be effective. IV administration presents several challenges to care, such as risk of infection, patient discomfort from injections, and higher cost of care than anti-infective drugs that can be taken orally (IV delivery must be performed by a doctor or nurse, often within a very expensive hospital setting). Although several technologies have been used to attempt to convert IV drugs to orally delivered medications, success has been limited due to the difficulty in achieving adequate bioavailability (i.e., the amount of drug that is absorbed into the body) with oral formulation. We believe that the unique cochleate crystal-structure in our platform technology protects the drug from degradation when it passes through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and that its lipid surface features facilitate the particle to be absorbed into the blood stream. The potential application of our cochleate delivery technology for the delivery of injectable medications offers significant clinical and commercial value if successfully demonstrated in human clinical trials.
 
Our cochleate lipid-crystal nano-particle technology changes the delivery of medicines in a unique manner and alters the bio-distribution of these medications by targeting tissues and organs that are affected by infection and inflammation. Besides IV-only anti-infectives such as amphotericin B and amikacin, we have orally delivered in animal studies the influenza vaccine, siRNA, NSAIDs, other anti-infectives such as atovaquone, and many other compounds across multiple therapeutic areas, demonstrating the potential broad application of our technology. We have observed rapid local accumulation in infected tissues, which appear be the result of transport of our drug-loaded cochleates by macrophages and other immune-cells. For example, in a mouse model of invasive candidiasis, comparing orally administered MAT2203 to injected amphotericin B deoxycholate (original drug Fungizone), we observed amphotericin B levels above the minimal inhibitory concentration inside infected organs on day 1 with MAT2203 treatment while such levels were not reached with the injected original amphotericin-deoxycholate product until 3-4 days of treatment. Such kinetics have been seen before with other medications, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g. azithromycin). It appears from our data that the kinetics of cochleate delivery has similarities to the kinetics of macrolide antibiotics. We expect that additional pre-clinical and clinical work on the kinetics of our cochleate products will further elucidate the mechanism of cochleate delivery to the site of infection or inflammation.
 
Historical Development of Cochleate Delivery Technology
 
The cochleate delivery technology was originally developed by the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and Albany Medical College in collaboration with BioDelivery Sciences, Inc., a company founded in 1995 by Dr. Raphael Mannino, who joined our Scientific Advisory Board in connection with the Aquarius acquisition, and Dr. Susan Gould-Fogerite, and others. BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (NASDAQ: BDSI) acquired BioDelivery Sciences, Inc. in 2002 and Dr. Mannino and Dr. Gould-Fogerite joined BDSI’s management team. BDSI continued the development of the cochleate delivery technology pursuant to an exclusive license with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and Albany Medical College and application of such drug delivery technology to an array of established pharmaceutics, including an application of cochleate delivery technology to a broad spectrum anti-fungal drug called amphotericin B, which has developed into our MAT 2203 product candidate. BDSI filed an IND for this product at the end of 2006, performed several animal toxicology studies and performed a single dose Phase 1 study. In the animal studies conducted by BDSI, doses used in toxicology studies were shown to produce measureable tissue concentrations and efficacy against the fungal infections candidiasis and aspergillosis. In 2009, BDSI reported preliminary results from its Phase 1 study in humans, where BDSI indicated that plasma concentrations of amphotericin B were detected in the sample of patients tested suggesting oral absorption from the cochleate delivery system. Forty-eight healthy volunteers participated in the study, with sixteen recruited for each of three dose groups. In each dose group, twelve volunteers received a single dose of cochleate amphotericin B (MAT 2203) and four received a placebo. Amphotericin B plasma concentrations were measured over a period of fourteen days. The study identified doses that were well-tolerated with no meaningful changes in laboratory safety values including those associated with renal function. The preliminary pharmacokinetic evaluation, available in February 2009, revealed that plasma concentrations were comparable to those seen in prior animal toxicology studies using the same formulation. In previous animal studies conducted by BDSI in collaboration with PHRI, a microbiological research institute associated with Rutgers University, doses used in such studies were shown to produce measureable tissue concentrations and efficacy against the fungal infections candidiasis and aspergillosis. In 2009, BDSI focused its resources on its BEMA opioid delivery technology and the rights to the cochleated technology reverted back to Rutgers University. In 2012, Rutgers University spun out the cochleate technology into a new company named Aquarius Biotechnologies Inc., which we subsequently acquired in 2015 and later renamed as Matinas BioPharma Nanotechnologies Inc.

Additional Pipeline Opportunities
 
We believe our cochleate delivery technology can be used to reformulate a wide variety of molecules and drugs which, (i) require delivery technology to effectively protect molecules and drugs in the body and could benefit from efficient delivery and cellular uptake by target cells, and (ii) are currently only available in IV formulations or, (iii) otherwise experience significant toxicity-related adverse events. Leveraging our cochleate delivery technology, we believe we can develop a robust pipeline of product candidates, either internally or through robust strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotech companies. We have tested a range of pharmaceutical compounds reformulated by our cochleate delivery technology in proof-of-concept animal studies, including oligonucleotides (mRNA, siRNA, DNA plasmids), vaccines, anti-inflammatory agents, NSAIDs and atovaquone. By way of example, in 2016 we received a patent issuance related to cochleate compositions directed against expressions of proteins. The allowed patent claims cover our proprietary methods related to the composition and the formation of encochleated siRNA for potential use as therapy for regulating gene expression. We intend to pursue opportunities to develop products, either alone or in partnership with other pharmaceutical or biotech companies, related to this technology and this remains a key part of our strategy to maximize the value of this unique and disruptive lipid-crystal nanoparticle delivery technology.
Exclusive License Agreement with Rutgers University
 
Through our acquisition of Aquarius, we acquired a license from Rutgers University for the cochleate delivery technology. The Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement between Aquarius and Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey (successor in interest to the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey) provides for, among other things, (1) a license issue fee of $25,000 paid upon execution, (2) an increased equity interest in the company from 5% to 7.5% of Aquarius (prior to our acquisition of Aquarius in the Aquarius Merger), (3) royalties on a tiered basis between low single digits and the mid-single digits of net sales of products using such licensed technology, (4) a one-time sales milestone fee of $100,000 when and if sales of products using the licensed technology reach the specified sales threshold and (5) an annual license fee of initially $10,000, increasing to $50,000 over the term of the license agreement. We also agreed to assume the responsibility to pay required patent prosecution and maintenance fees covering the technology.
 
Unless otherwise terminated by either party, the term of the license, on a country by country basis, shall be the longer of 7-1/2 years from the date of first commercial sale of a product in a country using the licensed technology or until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent rights licensed under the agreement, whichever is longer. Rutgers has the right to terminate the license agreement if we have not commenced commercial sales of at least one product using the licensed technology within nine years of the effective date of the license agreement.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our cohcleate delivery technoloty platform, product candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. We will seek to protect our cohcleate delivery technoloty platform, our products and associated technologies for their manufacturing and development through a combination of patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how, FDA exclusivity and contractual restrictions on disclosure. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. Our success will significantly depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology and inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely heavily on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

Exclusively Licensed Intellectual Property Relating to Our Proprietary Cochleate Delivery Technology Platform and MAT2203 and MAT2501
 
The patents and patent applications that we exclusively license from Rutgers University provide patent protection for the proprietary chemistry technology used in our process to make cochleates and formulate the active pharmaceutical ingredients delivered inside this delivery technology, as in MAT2203 and MAT2501. Pursuant to our license agreement, we have acquired rights to a portfolio of 21 issued and foreign patents, including 13 patents issued within the last 3 years, which extends patent protection until at least 2033. In addition, we have more than 20 pending patent applications filed both in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, including 16 national phase applications filed within the past 2 years. We have chosen to file these patent applications in selected foreign markets that we consider important for our product candidates. These international markets generally include Europe, China, India, Brazil, Russia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia and Mexico. These pending patent applications can extend patent protection through at least 2033. The patent portfolio covering our cochleate delivery system covers a broad spectrum of technology, including amphotericin B cochleates, geodate cochleates, methods of delivering nutrients or biologically relevant molecules to a host using cochleates, cochleate vaccine compositions and protein-lipid vesicles, small interfering RNA cochleates, methods of enhancing the encochleation of hydrophilic molecules and cochleates made with low purity soy phosphatidylserine.
 
We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our proprietary technology platform are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 
We also plan to seek trademark protection in the United States and outside of the United States where available and when appropriate. We intend to use these registered marks in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development as well as our product candidates.
 
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Many of these companies have far greater human and financial resources and may have product candidates in more advanced stages of development and many will reach the market before our product candidates. Competitors may also develop products that are more effective, safer or less expensive or that have better tolerability or convenience. Although we believe that our proprietary cochleate delivery technology, experience and knowledge in our areas of focus provide us with competitive advantages, these potential competitors could reduce our commercial opportunities. For many of our product candidates, we anticipate facing competition from other products that are available on a generic basis and offered at low prices. Many of these generic products have been marketed by third parties for many years and are well accepted by physicians, patients and payers.
 
We believe that MAT2203, MAT2501 and any other development candidate we may pursue in the future using our proprietary cochleate drug delivery technology platform, paralleled with our scientific and development expertise in the field of drug delivery, provide us with competitive advantages over our peers. However, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, as well as from generic drug manufacturers, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.

MAT2203 will primarily compete with antifungal classes approved for the treatment of candidemia and mold infectionss, which include polyenes, azoles and echinocandins. The approved branded therapies for these indications include Cancidas (caspofungin, marketed by Merck & Co.), Eraxis (anidulafungin, marketed by Pfizer, Inc.), Mycamine (micafungin, marketed by Astellas Pharma US, Inc.), Diflucan (fluconazole, marketed by Pfizer, Inc.), Noxafil (posaconazole, marketed by Merck & Co.), Vfend (voriconazole, marketed by Pfizer, Inc.), Sporanox (itraconazole, marketed by Jansen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), Cresemba (isavuconazole, marketed by Astellas Pharma US, Inc.), Ambisome (liposomal amphothericin B, marketed by Astellas Pharma US, Inc.) Abelcet (lipid complex amphothericin B, marketed by Sigma Tau Phrmaceuticals Inc.) and amphothericin B deoxycholate (marketed by X-Gen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). There currently are and may be more generic versions of these products available at the time of MAT2203 market approval, which will create added competition. In addition to approved therapies, we expect that MAT2203 may compete with product candidates that we are aware of in clinical development by third parties, such as SCY-078 (being developed by Scynexis, Inc.), CD101 IV (being developed by Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.) and certain products being developed by Viamet Pharmaceuticals Holdings, LLC, Vical Incorporated and F2G, Ltd.
 
MAT2501 will compete with a number of drugs currently in development, including ALIS®, an inhaled version of amikacin being developed by Insmed Incorporated for the treatment of NTM; plazomycin, which is being developed by Achaogen, Inc; eravacycline, which is being developed by Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Brilacidin®, being developed as a broad spectrum anti-bacterial by Cellceutix Corporation, and Raptor Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which has recently announced it intends to pursue development of an inhaled version of the antibiotic levofloxacin for the treatment of NTM.
 
Manufacturing
 
We currently lease and operate in-house manufacturing capabilities for our product candidates, including MAT2203 and MAT2501. While sufficient to produce the clinical supplies of product necessary to conduct our ongoing clinical trials and potentially early commercialization of these products, we will need to expand our internal manufacturing capabilities in the future. If we are not able to retain our current manufacturing facilities and if we do not develop additional in-house manufacturing capability for cochleates needed for our MAT2203 and MAT2501 product candidates sufficient to produce product for commercialization of these products, we will need to develop relationships with third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates which is likely to be time consuming and expensive.
 
There are a number of potential third-party suppliers for amphotericin B and amikacin, the generic active pharmaceutical ingredients in our lead clinical stage product candidates – MAT2203 and MAT2501, respectively. Although to date we have not entered into formal supply agreements to secure sufficient supply of amphotericin B and amikacin to support our clinical programs for MAT2203 and MAT2501, we believe we will be able to secure supply of amphotericin B and amikacin to support our clinical programs for MAT2203 and MAT2501 from one or more third-party suppliers. As we move through development for each of our product candidates, we expect to enter into long term supply arrangements for these key active pharmaceutical ingredients.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We currently do not have any sales and marketing infrastructure. We plan to retain U.S. marketing and sales rights or co-promotion rights for our product candidates for which we receive marketing approvals, particularly in situations where it is possible to access the market through a focused, specialized sales force. For situations in which a large sales force is required to access the market, and with respect to markets outside the United States, we generally plan to commercialize our product candidates through collaborative arrangements with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
 
In the United States, FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities.
 
Our product candidates must be approved by FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, in the case of biologic product candidates, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
 

● | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with FDA’s good laboratory practice, or cGLP, regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
● | preparation and submission to FDA of an NDA or BLA; 
● | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
● | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA or BLA; and 
● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by FDA. 

Nonclinical Studies
 
Nonclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of nonclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including cGLP regulations. The results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to FDA as part of an IND.

- 18 -
------

 

Companies usually must complete some long-term nonclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
Human Clinical Trials in Support of a Regulatory Approval
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by FDA, unless before that time FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 
In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to FDA in support of an NDA or IND so long as the clinical trial is conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the clinical trial through an on-site inspection, if FDA deems it necessary.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 
Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease (e.g. cancer) or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
 
Phase 2: The drug is administered to larger number of trial participants, may be up to several hundred, who usually have the disease or condition that the experimental drug is intended to treat, to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 
Phase 3: These clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug. In Phase 3 clinical trials, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 

- 19 -
------

 

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 
Submission of an NDA to FDA
 
Regulatory approval for most new drug or biologic products is based on two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials that provide evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the nonclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual prescription drug program fees and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
 
FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after FDA’s receipt of the submission whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by FDA for various reasons, and for various time periods, including for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by FDA following the original submission.
 
Before approving an NDA, FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 
FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations
 
FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
 
Specifically, FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with FDA and FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by FDA if FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

Second, in 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Improvement Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as “breakthrough therapies.” A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 
Third, FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
 
Under Section 524 of the FDCA, FDA is authorized to award a priority review voucher to sponsors of certain tropical disease product applications that meet the criteria specified in the Act. A priority review voucher may be used by the sponsor who obtains it or it may be transferred to another sponsor who may use it to obtain priority review for a different application. Priority review vouchers can result in the acceleration of review and approval of a product candidate by up to four months. In order to be eligible for a tropical disease priority review voucher, the application must be: for a listed tropical disease; submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA or Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act after September 27, 2007; for a product that contains no active ingredient that has been approved in any other application under those statutory provisions; and must qualify for priority review. FDA has identified in guidance those product applications for the prevention or treatment of tropical diseases that may qualify for a priority review voucher.
 
Accelerated Approval Pathway
 
FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.
 

- 21 -
------

 

The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by FDA.
 
FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 
On the basis of FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
If FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. In addition, as a condition of approval, FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, which may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.
 
FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 

- 22 -
------

 

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Once an approval is granted, FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
● | refusal of FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

 
FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
 
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the nonclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD.
 
Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the drug. At the same time, FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.
 

- 23 -
------

 

Upon approval of an ANDA, FDA indicates whether the generic product is therapeutically equivalent to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutically equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in automatic substitution of the generic drug by the pharmacist without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
 
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be submitted to FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.
 
Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30 Month Stay
 
Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant submits its application to FDA, the applicant is required to certify to FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 

● | the required patent information has not been filed; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the listed patent has expired; 
● | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 
● | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 

 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, FDA and FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.

- 24 -
------

 

FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA.
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which FDA cannot approve another application.
 
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting a NDA. If the request is granted, FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product will be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
 
21st Century Cures Act
 
On December 13, 2016, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increased funding for FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and expand funding for the National Institutes of Health. The Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research. It also charges NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. In addition, the Cures Act includes provisions requiring FDA to assess and publish guidance on the use of novel clinical trial designs, the use of real world evidence in applications, the availability of summary level review for supplemental applications for certain indications, and the qualification of drug development tools. Because the Cures Act has only recently been enacted, its potential effect on our business remains unclear with the exception of a provision requiring that we post our policies on the availability of expanded access programs for individuals. Because these provisions allow FDA to spend several years developing these policies, the effect on us could be delayed.

- 25 -
------

 

With amendments to the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; and revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications.
 
Section 3042 of the Cures Act authorizes a new “Limited Population Pathway” to expedite approval of antimicrobial products intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections for which there are unmet medical needs. Drugs approved under this provision would be required to adhere to special labeling requirements, including a prominent “Limited Population” statement. Additionally, in recognition of increasing concerns about drug-resistant infections, the Act requires the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to compile a report on antimicrobial resistance by 2021, which would include a review of any effect of the new Limited Population Pathway on antibacterial or antifungal resistance. We will monitor these developments but cannot currently assess how this initiative may impact our business.
 
Other Health Care Regulations
 
Health Privacy Laws
 
We are subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., principal investigators involved in our clinical trials) ) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, (“HIPAA”). HIPAA generally requires that covered entities (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) obtain written authorizations from patients prior to disclosing protected health information of the patient (unless an exception to the authorization requirement applies). If authorization is required and the patient fails to execute an authorization or the authorization fails to contain all required provisions, then we may not be allowed access to and use of the patient’s information and our research efforts could be impaired or delayed. Furthermore, use of protected health information that is provided to us pursuant to a valid patient authorization is subject to the limits set forth in the authorization (e.g., for use in research and in submissions to regulatory authorities for product approvals). Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards, as well as the various penalties or failure to comply, directly applicable to “business associates”—independent contractors or agents of covered entities performing certain functions involving the creation or use of protected health information on behalf of a covered entity, or providing services to a covered entity. While we do not believe we are a “business associate” under HIPAA, regulatory agencies may disagree.
 
The collection and use of personal health data in the European Union, presently governed by the provisions of the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC), or the EU Directive, as implemented by the European Member States, will be replaced with the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Currently, the EU Directive establishes a regulatory framework designed to protect the security of personal data collected about residents of the EU and the movement of such personal data across the national borders of the EU Member States. The EU Directive would apply to clinical trial data we may collect about residents of the European Union. GDPR was adopted in 2016 and will become enforceable in the European Union Member States in May 2018. The GDPR will impose many new or additional requirements including, but not limited to, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the nature and scope of notifications provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and using third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. Failure to comply with the EU Directive and the GDPR, when effective, could subject us to regulatory sanctions, delays in clinical trials, criminal prosecution and/or civil fines or penalties. Additionally, GDPR creates a direct cause of action by individual data subjects. To comply with the new data protection rules imposed by the GDPR we may be required to use additional human and financial resources to come into and maintain compliance.

Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal prosecution, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.
 
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback statute and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
Affordable Care Act
 
In late March 2010, the Federal government enacted the comprehensive health care reform package, the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Among other provisions, the ACA imposes individual and employer health insurance requirements, provides certain insurance subsidies (e.g., premiums and cost sharing), mandates extensive insurance market reforms, creates new health insurance access points (e.g., State and federal-based health insurance exchanges), expands the Medicaid program, promotes research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures, and makes a number of changes to how products and services will be reimbursed by the Medicare program. Amendments to the Federal False Claims Act under the ACA have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” (whistleblower) lawsuits against companies, under which the whistleblower may be entitled to receive a percentage of any money paid to the government.
 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges and amendments to certain aspects of the ACA. There is continued uncertainty about the implementation of the ACA, including the potential for further amendments to the ACA and legal challenges to or efforts to repeal the ACA. If the ACA is repealed or further modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the ACA are delayed, such repeal, modification or delay may materially adversely impact our business, strategies, prospects, operating results or financial condition. We are unable to predict the full impact of any repeal, modification or delay in the implementation of the ACA on us at this time. Due to the substantial regulatory changes that will need to be implemented by CMS and others, and the numerous processes required to implement these reforms, we cannot predict which healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, the timing of any such reforms, or the effect such reforms or any other future legislation or regulation will have on our business.
 
Designation of and Exclusivity for Qualified Infectious Disease Products
 
In 2012, Congress passed legislation known as the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or GAIN Act. This legislation is designed to encourage the development of antibacterial and antifungal drug products that treat pathogens that cause serious and life-threatening infections. To that end, the law grants an additional five years of marketing exclusivity upon the approval of an NDA for a drug product designated by FDA as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP. Thus, for a QIDP, the periods of five year new chemical entity exclusivity, three year new clinical investigation exclusivity and seven year orphan drug exclusivity, would become 10 years, eight years, and 12 years, respectively.

- 27 -
------

 

A QIDP is defined in the GAIN Act to mean “an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by—(1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens;” or (2) certain “qualifying pathogens.” A “qualifying pathogen” is a pathogen that has the potential to pose a serious threat to public health (e.g., resistant gram positive pathogens, multi-drug resistant gram negative bacteria, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and Clostridium difficile) and that is included in a list established and maintained by FDA. A drug sponsor may request FDA to designate its product as a QIDP any time before the submission of an NDA. FDA must make a QIDP determination within 60 days of the designation request. A product designated as a QIDP will be granted priority review by FDA and can qualify for “fast track” status.
 
The additional five years of market exclusivity under the GAIN Act for drug products designated by FDA as QIDPs applies only to a drug that is first approved on or after July 9, 2012. Additionally, the five-year exclusivity extension does not apply to: a supplement to an application under Section 505(b) of the FDCA for any QIDP for which an extension is in effect or has expired; a subsequent application submitted with respect to a product approved by FDA for a change that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength; or a product that does not meet the definition of a QIDP under Section 505(g) based upon its approved uses.
 
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a NDA, plus the time between the submission date of a NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with FDA.
 
Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.

To obtain marketing approval of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
 
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
 
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 
The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
 
If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.
 
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.

In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
 
Healthcare Law and Regulation
 
Healthcare providers, physicians and third party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

● | the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
● | the HIPPA imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
● | HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
● | the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 
● | the federal transparency requirements under the ACA requires manufacturers of drugs to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests and the reported information will be made publicly available on a searchable website; and 
● | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers.

Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Employees
 
As of March 2, 2018, we had 15 full-time employees.
 
Research and Development
 
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we spent approximately $9.0 million, $3.9 million and $5.3, respectively, on research and development activities. These expenses include cash and non-cash expenses relating to the development of our clinical and pre-clinical programs, including our anti-infective product candidates, MAT2203 and MAT2501 as well as support and enhancement of our drug delivery technology.
Corporate and Available Information
 
We were incorporated in Delaware under the name Matinas BioPharma Holdings, Inc. in May 2013. We have two operating subsidiaries: Matinas BioPharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Matinas BioPharma Nanotechnologies Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly known as Aquarius Biotechnologies Inc.). Nereus BioPharma LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (and Matinas BioPharma’s predecessor) was formed on August 12, 2011. On February 29, 2012, Nereus BioPharma LLC converted from a limited liability company to a corporation and changed its name to Matinas BioPharma, Inc. In July 2013, Matinas BioPharma, Inc. entered into entered into a merger agreement (the “2013 Merger Agreement”) with Matinas Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary, or Merger Sub. Pursuant to the terms of the 2013 Merger Agreement, as a condition of and contemporaneously with the initial closing of the 2013 Private Placement, Merger Sub merged (the “2013 Merger”) with and into Matinas BioPharma and Matinas BioPharma became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. After consummation of the Merger transaction, the management of Matinas BioPharma became the management of Holdings and the board representatives consisted of four former Board members of Matinas BioPharma and Mr. Adam Stern as the Aegis Capital Corp. nominee. Because Holdings was formed solely to effect the 2013 Merger and the 2013 Private Placement, with no operations, and assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents, we accounted for the 2013 Merger as a reverse acquisition. The legal acquirer Matinas BioPharma becomes the successor entity, and its historical results became the historical results for Holdings (the legal acquirer and the registrant). On January 29, 2015, we acquired Aquarius Biotechnologies Inc. which was subsequently renamed Matinas BioPharma Nanotechnologies, Inc.
