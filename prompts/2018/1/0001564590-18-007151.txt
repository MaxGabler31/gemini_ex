Overview
 We are a precision medicine company using molecular diagnostics and informatics to help combat infectious disease. We are developing molecular information products and services for global healthcare settings, helping to guide clinicians with more rapid and actionable information about life threatening infections, improve patient outcomes, and decrease the spread of infections caused by multidrug-resistant microorganisms, or MDROs. Our proprietary DNA tests and informatics address the rising threat of antibiotic resistance by helping physicians and other healthcare providers optimize care decisions for patients with acute infections.
 Our molecular diagnostics and informatics offerings combine our Acuitas® DNA tests and Acuitas Lighthouse® informatics platform for use with our proprietary, curated MDRO knowledgebase. We are working to deliver our products and services, some in development, to a global network of customers and partners.

 We have established a number of collaborative arrangements to support execution of our business strategy as we work to address the more than $2 billion potential market for precision medicine MDRO solutions. Our relationship with Merck & Co., Inc. includes investment from Merck Global Health Innovation Fund, or MGHIF, and a research collaboration with Merck Sharp & Dohme, or MSD, to provide access to MSD’s 250,000 clinical isolate SMART bacterial surveillance archive. In December 2017, we entered into a subcontractor agreement with ILÚM Health Solutions, LLC, an entity created by Merck’s Healthcare Services and Solutions  division, whereby ILÚM Health Solutions will provide services to the Company in the performance of the Company’s CDC contract to deploy ILÚM’s commercially-available cloud- and mobile-based software platform for infectious disease management in up to three medical sites in Colombia with the aim of improving antibiotic use in resource-limited settings. 
 In June 2017, we entered into a global supply agreement to provide customer access to Thermo Fisher Scientific’s products to support the commercialization of our Acuitas Rapid Test and Acuitas Lighthouse Software products in development to combat MDROs. We have worked closely with Intermountain Healthcare, or IHC, a leading integrated health system, to complete a comprehensive retrospective study to evaluate the burden and costs of antibiotic resistance at IHC. We are working to expand these established relationships and to enter into additional collaborative arrangements in the future.
 We believe more rapid genetic identification methods will reduce morbidity from MDROs, reduce healthcare costs through reduced length of stay, and assist in the identification of targeted antibiotic therapy. Current conventional microbiology, largely unchanged in 50 years, requires one to two days for growth and phenotypic analysis and often leads to the use of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy in the early stages of infection.
 We are developing a new high resolution AMR Gene Panel designed to determine pathogen levels in clinical specimens and the key drug resistance gene profiles of Gram-negative organisms. Following completion of our research and development efforts and receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals, we anticipate the AMR Gene Panel will be used in the clinical setting to provide pathogen and antibiotic resistance gene information to aid in decision-making for patients with complicated urinary tract infections, or cUTI, lower respiratory tract infections, and blood stream infections.

Lead Rapid Diagnostic and Acuitas Lighthouse Software
 Our lead product in development is the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 for patients at risk for cUTI. The AMR Gene Panel u5.47 is a direct test that will be able to be performed in under three hours to identify five pathogens associated with urinary tract infections and their levels and 47 genes associated with antibiotic resistance. We anticipate that the Acuitas Lighthouse Software will be used to provide additional interpretation of test results including probability of resistance for fourteen antibiotics commonly used to treat cUTI. Approximately 10,000 bacterial isolates from the Merck SMART surveillance network and other sources have been tested and added to the Acuitas Lighthouse Knowledgebase to support development and use of the Acuitas Lighthouse Software antibiotic resistance prediction decision-making algorithms. Preliminary performance data for E. coli and K. pneumonia in our Acuitas Lighthouse Software algorithms was presented at the ASM Microbe meeting in June 2017. Accuracy of prediction ranged from 77% to 96%. These data and additional data from our research combined with the anticipated results from the AMR Gene Panel u5.47 support the potential for the Acuitas Lighthouse Software to provide actionable antibiotic resistance prediction information directly from clinical specimens in under three hours. The figure below describes the potential workflow and anticipated results from our new testing approach.
Current Diagnostic Tests and Informatics Offerings
 Our suite of DNA-based products and products in development are intended to provide actionable, precise diagnostic information supported by the proprietary genomic Acuitas Lighthouse Knowledgebase to facilitate data interpretation. The Acuitas DNA tests use multiplex PCR to help provide reliable and accurate detection of drug resistance. The QuickFISH tests are powered by PNA technology and provide rapid pathogen identification, typically in less than 30 minutes from a positive blood culture result. The Acuitas MDRO Gene Test is used for determining if acute care patients are colonized with MDROs. Positive samples are confirmed using microbiological methods and the Acuitas Resistome Test for high resolution genotyping. Test results are maintained in the Acuitas Lighthouse data warehouse for subsequent interpretation by physicians and healthcare providers.
 Our Strategy
 We are using our current product and service offerings, and will use our products in development to build and commercialize a comprehensive precision medicine solution for combatting infectious disease with a focus on developing diagnostic tests for rapid pathogen identification and genetic profiling, antibiotic resistance analysis and advanced informatics to store and analyze MDRO and other infectious disease data for hospitals, out-patient settings and other healthcare providers.
 The two core components of our strategy are development and commercialization of rapid diagnostic tests and leveraging our Acuitas Lighthouse information services into new markets and channels.
  
• | Rapid diagnostics – We are developing OpGen-branded Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests for use on the Thermo Fisher Scientific Applied Biosystems™ QuantStudio™ 5 Real-Time PCR System. The first of these new tests will be for management of patients with cUTI. We anticipate developing tests for additional clinical indications such as lower respiratory tract infections and for new antibiotic decision- making applications. The second rapid diagnostics growth driver will be through strategic partner relationships where we will work to expand channel access for our proprietary DNA tests through development and subsequent use of these tests, utilizing the Acuitas Lighthouse Software on established rapid in vitro diagnostic testing platforms.

Molecular Information Business
 We are working to build a unique and highly proprietary molecular information business. Our approach combines FDA-cleared and CE-marked rapid diagnostics and CLIA lab-based MDRO surveillance tests with our Acuitas Lighthouse Software. We are developing an integrated solution based on a genomic knowledgebase of drug-resistant pathogens. Our approach involves sourcing thousands of pathogens from hospitals worldwide and completing genomic analysis including DNA sequencing and drug susceptibility testing of each individual pathogen. These data are combined along with hospital patient data and other information in our Acuitas Lighthouse Knowledgebase. We anticipate using this information and insights we derive from it to help power our rapid diagnostic products, healthcare management solutions and new applications to support pharmaceutical companies.

Market Overview
 
Antibiotic Resistance – An Urgent Global Issue
 We believe that antimicrobial resistance is an urgent global healthcare issue. MDROs have been prioritized as an urgent national and global threat by the CDC, the executive branch of the federal government and the WHO. In September 2014, The White House issued a National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria. This strategy calls for the strengthening of surveillance efforts to combat resistance, the development and use of innovative diagnostic tests for identification and characterization of resistant bacteria and antibiotic stewardship and development.
 The CDC estimates that in the United States more than two million people are sickened every year with antibiotic-resistant infections, with at least 23,000 dying as a result. Antibiotic- resistant infections add considerable but often avoidable costs to the U.S. healthcare system. In most cases, these infections require prolonged and/or costlier treatments, extended hospital stays, additional doctor visits and healthcare facilities use, and result in greater disability and death compared with infections that are treatable with antibiotics. Estimates for the total economic cost to the U.S. economy are difficult to calculate but have been estimated to be as high as $20 billion in excess direct healthcare costs annually. As described in a December 2014 report issued by the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance commissioned by the U.K. Prime Minister, titled “Antimicrobial Resistance: Tackling a Crisis for the Health and Wealth of Nations,” 300 million people are expected to die prematurely because of drug resistance over the next 35 years, which could result in $60 to $100 trillion worth of lost economic output if the problem of antimicrobial drug resistance is not resolved.
 Over the last decade multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, frequently referred to as Superbugs, have been implicated in severe HAIs, and their occurrence has increased steadily. For example, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or K. pneumoniae, is responsible for roughly 15% of Gram-negative infections in hospital intensive care units. Infections caused by KPC strains have few treatment options and are associated with a mortality rate upwards of 50%.
 Exacerbating the problems associated with the emergence of these highly resistant KPC strains is their propensity to cause outbreaks in healthcare institutions. These pathogens persist both in the flora of hospitalized patients and in the hospital environment, and they have the capacity to silently colonize patients or hospital personnel by establishing residence in the gastrointestinal tract without causing any signs of infection. Individuals can be silently colonized or become asymptomatic carriers for long periods of time, with detection of these carriers often proving difficult. These silent carriers act as reservoirs for continued transmission, which makes subsequent spread difficult to control and outbreaks difficult to stop. In addition, KPC strains can survive for several hours on the hands of hospital personnel, which likely facilitates the spread of organisms from patient to patient. Effective control of KPC outbreaks requires a detailed understanding of how transmission occurs, but current technologies do not allow healthcare providers to routinely perform these investigations on a timely basis.
 The lack of currently available treatment options and scarcity of new treatment options in development are compounding the emerging Superbug problem. It has been close to 30 years since a new class of antibiotics was developed and successfully introduced. As a result, we believe that rapid, accurate identification of the pathogen and its genetic make-up, screening, infection control and antibiotic stewardship have become one of the most powerful weapons in the fight to contain this threat.
 Based on industry analyses, we believe the global HAI market is a $2 billion dollar market with the molecular diagnostic segment representing a fast growing segment of such market with multiple high acuity patients and significant infectious sites, including urinary tract infections, surgical site infections, pneumonia, bloodstream infections.
 Products
 Our lead product are the Acuitas® AMR Gene Panel u5.47 and the Acuitas Lighthouse Software.

Acuitas AMR Gene Panel and Acuitas Lighthouse Software 
 The Acuitas® AMR Gene Panel u5.47 is a qualitative and semi-quantitative nucleic acid-based in vitro diagnostic test that is capable of simultaneous detection and identification of multiple bacterial nucleic acids and select genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance in urine specimens or bacterial colonies isolated from urine. The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of specific agents of urinary tract infections, or UTI, for patients at risk of complicated urinary tract infection. The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 employs automated deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, extraction on the Qiagen® EZ1® Advanced XL and multiplex real-time PCR on the Applied Biosystems™ QuantStudio 5™ PCR System. The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 RUO test detects 47 gene targets which span 600 subtypes and convey resistance to 9 classes of antibiotics directly from urine and isolated colonies.  Gene families detected include: KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP, OXA, CTXM-1, CTXM-9, CMY, MCR, and resistance genes to fluoroquinolone antibiotics. From urine specimens, the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 RUO will semi-quantitatively detect the most common bacterial causes of cUTI (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis, E. faecalis). While the test is currently designed to detect only 5 bacterial species, this test will detect resistance genes in other organisms if present without providing species identification. Test results are provided in under three hours, compared with traditional microbiology methods, which can take two to three days. The figure below describes the workflow for the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 test and the Acuitas Lighthouse Software.
 
The Acuitas Lighthouse Software manages and evaluates data that identify the most common microbial causes of cUTI and key genetic determinants of antibiotic drug resistance, based on the amplification data of gene targets extracted from urine specimens. Through analysis of this data, the Acuitas Lighthouse Software can identify five bacterial species and predict resistance to up to fourteen  different antibiotics from across nine  antibiotic classes including: Aminoglycosides, Carbapenems, Cephalosporins, Fluoroquinolones, Polymyxins, Penicillins, Sulfonamides, Trimethoprim and Vancomycin. The Acuitas Lighthouse Software consists of the Acuitas Lighthouse Portal, a web application; the Acuitas Lighthouse Prediction Engine, data analysis software; and draws from the Lighthouse Knowledgebase, a relational database management system; and minor supporting software components. All components of this Acuitas Lighthouse Software are securely hosted in a cloud-hosted, web-based application. The input to Acuitas Lighthouse Software is a data file generated by processing the results from the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 test through the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 Gene Analysis Software. This input file indicates which gene targets were detected by the assay and is loaded into the Acuitas Lighthouse Software via an interface of the Acuitas Lighthouse Portal, accessed by the user through a web browser. The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 Gene Analysis Software results are retained by the Acuitas Lighthouse Knowledgebase and are sent to the Acuitas Lighthouse Prediction Engine for analysis. The Acuitas Lighthouse Prediction Engine contains software implementations of data models that were derived using a training panel of thousands of bacterial isolates with detailed genotypic and phenotypic characterizations, all stored within the Acuitas Lighthouse Knowledgebase. These models, each specific to one (1) microbial species and antibiotic drug pairing, are used to make predictions of antibiotic resistance by analyzing the loaded input data. The results from the Acuitas Lighthouse Prediction Engine indicate whether there is evidence of resistance detected through the 
 10


presence of specific genes, and if there is known intrinsic resistance to certain drugs. These final results are reported to the user via a Prediction Report and the Resistance Dashboard interface in the Acuitas Lighthouse Portal; both displays present the Acuitas Lighthouse Prediction Engine output in combination with selected input data and metadata, as well as the semi-quantitative counts of gene copies / mL for urine specimens. Development of the Acuitas Lighthouse Software and the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 was the result of a comprehensive, multi-year development effort to help address urgent clinical needs for improved rapid antibiotic decision-making capabilities.

 Other Acuitas Products
 Our high resolution DNA tests are marketed under the Acuitas trade name. We have developed Acuitas DNA tests, such as the Acuitas MDRO Gene Test, for use in our CLIA laboratory, 

• | Our Acuitas MDRO Gene Test, launched in 2014, is, to our knowledge, the first CLIA lab-based test able to provide information regarding the presence of ten MDRO resistance genes from one patient specimen. The ten drug-resistant genes identified by our Acuitas MDRO Gene Test are associated with CRE, ESBL and VRE organisms, and are gastrointestinal organisms frequently associated with antibiotic-resistant infections. The test results can be used by healthcare providers to identify patients colonized with organisms expressing the drug-resistant genes or who are actively infected.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our Acuitas CR Elite Test, launched in 2014, adds the ability for the healthcare provider to order a microbiology culture screen to be performed from the same specimen sent for our Acuitas MDRO Gene Test, thereby providing additional information about the organism(s) associated with an active infection, as well as an antibiotic susceptibility profile for such organism(s).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our Acuitas Resistome Test, launched in the second quarter of 2015, is a more comprehensive MDRO molecular test which detects 49 genes covering over 900 subtypes associated with antibiotic resistance. The test includes additional resistance genes for carbapenemases, ESBLs and AmpC genes, in replacement of the Vancomycin resistant genes found in the Acuitas MDRO Gene Test. We use Acuitas Resistome Test results for Acuitas Lighthouse profiling of specimens collected in hospitals and clinical isolates from infected patients. Information from our Acuitas Resistome Test provides additional gene detection information to supplement our Acuitas MDRO Gene Test.

 Acuitas Resistome Test results can be used in conjunction with the Acuitas CR Elite Test to provide high resolution Acuitas Lighthouse profiles. Our goal is to provide DNA test-based Acuitas Lighthouse profiles, within 24 hours of sample receipt, and, using the Acuitas CR Elite Test to supplement our Acuitas Lighthouse profiles, with biologically derived, phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility data within 48 hours. We anticipate improving the accuracy, over time, of our Acuitas Resistome Test by performing DNA sequence analysis of microbial isolates characterized within our Acuitas Lighthouse Knowledgebase. We believe our menu of genotypic and phenotypic tests along with our Acuitas Lighthouse informatics platform, will enable better surveillance and epidemiology, improved infection control practices, improved antibiotic stewardship and individualized patient care, as well as help to facilitate outbreak detection and response in healthcare settings.

Acuitas Lighthouse
 Our Acuitas Lighthouse informatics platform enables proactive MDRO management to prevent in-hospital transmission events and to help improve patient outcomes. Using our Acuitas Lighthouse informatics, launched in December 2015, we offer trend analysis of patient specific data, data specific to individual hospital facilities and health systems, which can be accessed safely and confidentially by healthcare providers. Our Acuitas Lighthouse’s dynamic profiling incorporates identity, phenotype and MDRO gene presence and assigns unique microbe identifiers, or Acuitas Lighthouse profiles, based on MDRO gene composition, and antibiotic susceptibility, or AST, data. We believe our Acuitas Lighthouse profiling will provide a comprehensive diagnostic tracking tool for MDRO infections in the hospital setting. It is based on our CLIA- and HIPAA-compliant LIMS database system. We have developed a web-based portal to allow our customers access to LIMS-based lab reports and Acuitas Lighthouse data reports.
Research and Development
 
For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our research and development expenses were $6.9 million and $8.6 million, respectively. We intend to continue to invest in the development of additional Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests and our Acuitas Lighthouse informatics platform, and to support commercial sales of our QuickFISH rapid identification tests. Our current focus is on completing the development of the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 and our other product offerings to provide actionable, precise diagnostics powered by our Acuitas Lighthouse Software for rapid diagnostics of pathogens, determination of the appropriate antibiotics to treat the infection and accumulation of actionable surveillance data to provide information useful for monitoring and controlling outbreaks and promoting antibiotic stewardship.
 Our ongoing and anticipated research and development efforts include:
  
• | development of the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests for additional indications, and clinical trial work to support a 510(k) application for commercial launch of the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel 5u.47;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continued investments in our Acuitas Lighthouse informatics platform, focused on (i) data warehouse and portal for MDRO data and (ii) antibiotic analysis;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanding our clinical decision support capabilities by completing the work under the CDC contract to develop smartphone-based clinical decision support solutions for antimicrobial stewardship and infection control in low- and middle-income countries;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | working with pharmaceutical companies to add new or recently FDA approved antibiotics to the Acuitas Lighthouse Software
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | further development of our Acuitas MDRO Gene Test, Acuitas Resistome Test and Acuitas Whole Genome Sequence Analysis; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | converting our CLIA lab-based products to IVD kits that can be sold, upon receipt of FDA clearance and other approvals, directly to our customers and to other clinical reference laboratories.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During 2018 we anticipate finalizing the regulatory approach for commercializing the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 and the Acuitas Lighthouse Software. We believe that separate FDA 510(k) regulatory submissions will be required for both of these products. The objective is to complete clinical trials and analytical validation work to support FDA submissions during the fourth quarter of 2018. We anticipate the clinical trial will involve 4-5 clinical sites and the testing of approximately 5,000 clinical samples and bacterial isolates. The final scope of the clinical trial will be finalized following pre-submission meetings with the FDA. 
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We currently sell and market our products and services directly in the United States through a dedicated sales and marketing support team. Internationally, we sell our products through a network of distributors in 11 countries. We operate a subsidiary in Denmark that provides support for our European customers and to distributors in other parts of the world. We anticipate expanding our commercial organization in conjunction with the anticipated FDA clearance to commercialize our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 and Acuitas Lighthouse Software products. During 2018 our strategy to build demand for our products following receipt of such regulatory clearance includes completing clinical verification studies, sales of the AMR Gene Panel for Research Use Only, and in conjunction with such FDA clearance entering into channel partner co-marketing and distribution agreements.
 
12


We are generating data to support the commercialization of our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 and Acuitas Lighthouse Software products through a structured clinical verification program including  academic medical centers and clinical collaborators. In March 2018 we announced the first of these agreements with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Participants in our clinical verification program will potentially participate in our FDA clinical trials. Results from these activities will support publications and peer to peer medical communications.
 
In the first quarter of 2018, we introduced the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 for infection control purposes and pharmaceutical surveillance research as a Research Use Only test for cUTI. The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 will be available while the Company completes clinical trials and regulatory submissions to support FDA clearance to commercialize such products for broader clinical use. We anticipate that customers who use the products as RUO tests for infection control and clinical research will serve as a potential installed base for the FDA cleared product in 2019. Our rapid pathogen identification FISH products are used by nearly 100 customers in the US and internationally. Many of these customers are potential customers for our FDA-cleared Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 test. We are working to expand our market reach by entering into strategic co-marketing relationships with larger diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies and by expanding our network of distributors globally.
 We operate in one segment. Substantially all of our operations are in the United States. Total revenues from customers for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $3.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively. Net loss for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $15.4 million and $19.2 million, respectively. Total assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $6.6 million and $9.0 million, respectively. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenue earned under the CDC contract represented 11% of total revenues. No individual customer represented in excess of 10% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
Competition
 
We believe we are currently the only company developing a molecular information business focused on leading a transformation in microbiology and infectious disease through precision medicine products and services that combine genomic data and informatics. Our approach combines proprietary DNA tests developed in our CLIA laboratory, FDA-cleared and CE-marked rapid diagnostics, and our Acuitas Lighthouse informatics and data warehouse offerings. Our competitors include rapid diagnostic testing and traditional microbiology companies, commercial laboratories, information technology companies, and hospital laboratories who may internally develop testing capabilities. Principal competitive factors in our target market include: organizational size, scale, and breadth of product offerings; rapidity of test results; quality and strength of clinical and analytical validation data and confidence in diagnostic results; cost effectiveness; ease of use; and regulatory approval status.
 Our principal competition comes from traditional methods used by healthcare providers to diagnose and screen for MDROs and from other molecular diagnostic companies creating screening and diagnostic products such as Cepheid, Becton-Dickinson, bioMérieux, Accelerate Diagnostics, T2 Biosystems, GenMark, Curetis and Nanosphere. We believe our focus on identifying antibiotic-resistant genes, rather than primarily organisms, the genes and associated diseases included in our gene tests, and our Acuitas Lighthouse informatics offerings distinguish us from such competitors.
 We also face competition from commercial laboratories, such as ARUP Laboratories, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and EuroFins, which have strong infrastructure to support the commercialization of diagnostic laboratory services.
 Competitors may develop their own versions of our product offerings in countries where we do not have patents or where our intellectual property rights are not recognized.
 Many of our potential competitors have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, research and development and selling and marketing capabilities than we do. Others may develop products with prices lower than ours that could be viewed by hospitals, physicians and payers as functionally equivalent to our products and services, or offer products and services at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower our list prices and affect our ability to achieve profitability. If we are unable to change clinical practice in a meaningful way or compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance and sales of our products, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability and could cause our stock price to decline.

Laboratory Operations 
 
Our laboratory operations are headquartered at our CLIA-certified laboratory in Gaithersburg, Maryland, where we perform all Acuitas MDRO tests. Samples are transported to the laboratory by FedEx or by courier. Once received, samples are assessed for acceptability, accessioned into our LIMS, prepared for processing and analyzed with traditional microbiology culture methods or using molecular testing instrumentation. Laboratory test data is housed in a proprietary LIMS database that is CLIA and HIPAA compliant. Customers access CLIA laboratory test results through individual PDF test reports and through our Acuitas Lighthouse informatics. Our laboratory also performs testing for research and development, quality control, and for both the creation and ongoing maintenance of our Acuitas Lighthouse data warehouse.
 We believe we have sufficient laboratory capacity to perform Acuitas testing for at least the next 24 months.
 Manufacturing
 
During 2017, we manufactured our  FDA-cleared and CE-marked QuickFISH and PNA FISH products in our Woburn, Massachusetts facility. We are currently in the process of transferring these manufacturing operations to our Gaithersburg, Maryland facility. 
 Manufacturing of our FDA-cleared products is performed under the current Good Manufacturing Practices – Quality System Regulation as required by the FDA for the manufacture of IVD labeled products. These regulations carefully control the manufacture, testing and release of IVD products as well as raw material receipt and control. We also have ongoing postmarket surveillance and vigilance responsibilities under FDA regulations, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the FDA’s requirements, including primarily the quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on FDA’s Form 483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. Our Woburn, Massachusetts facility was inspected by the FDA in 2015. Following such inspection, the FDA issued a report of its findings and observations, typically referred to as “Form 483 observations,” primarily related to our quality systems and testing policies and documentation. We have responded to all inspection observations within the required timeframe and have worked with the FDA’s Office of Compliance to satisfy all identified deficiencies.
 Seasonality of Business
 We do not believe our business is subject to seasonality. However, our business can be subject to and affected by the business practices of our business partners. To the extent that the availability of inventory or materials from or development practices of our partners is seasonal, our sales may be subject to fluctuations quarter to quarter or year over year.
Quality Assurance
 Our quality assurance function oversees the quality of our laboratory and our FDA-cleared and CE-marked diagnostic products as well as the quality systems used in research and development, client services, billing operations and sales and marketing. We have established a quality assurance system across our entire business, including implementation and maintenance, document control, supplier qualification, corrective or preventive actions, oversight, and employee training processes. We monitor and seek to improve our quality over time in compliance with all applicable regulations.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
We procure PCR amplification reagents and the QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System from Thermo Fisher Scientific. DNA purification reagents and the EZ1 DNA Purification System are procured from Qiagen, NV. We procure reagents, equipment, chips and other materials we use to perform our Acuitas MDRO Gene Test from sole suppliers such as Fluidigm Corporation. We purchase the PNA probes, glass slides and specialty consumables for our QuickFISH products from third party manufacturers who have long lead times and who manufacture several of these products for us on a sole source basis. We also purchase our collection kits from sole-source suppliers. Some of these items are unique to these suppliers and vendors. While we have developed alternative sourcing strategies for these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain whether these strategies will be effective or whether alternative sources will be available when we need them. If these suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials we need to perform our Acuitas MDRO Gene Test or manufacture our QuickFISH products, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications, or if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, our business would be negatively affected.
 14


Payments and Reimbursement
 
Our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel, the Acuitas Lighthouse Software, MDRO test products, and our QuickFISH tests are, and other future products and services will be, sold to hospitals and public health organizations as products and on a fee-for-service basis. When hospital and health system clients purchase our QuickFISH tests we bill them directly for the purchase of test kits and consumables. Hospitals that purchase MDRO services from our CLIA laboratory are billed on a per test basis. In the future, we envision selling our Acuitas Lighthouse Software to health systems, hospitals and long-term care facilities under capitated, flat-rate contracts. We believe that hospitals will recoup costs of our products and services by obtaining reimbursement from the government or private insurance companies for in-bed occupancies, which traditionally includes all testing required for admitted patients. When our tests are used prior to hospital admission, hospitals, clinical laboratories, and other healthcare provider customers that purchase our products may bill various third-party payers to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with diagnostic tests, including the cost of the purchase of our products.
Intellectual Property
 
In order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. To that end, in order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. To that end, we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contracts, such as confidentiality, invention assignment and licensing agreements. We also rely upon trade secret laws to protect unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation. In addition, we have what we consider to be reasonable security measures in place to maintain confidentiality. Our intellectual property strategy is intended to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had total ownership rights to 35 patents, including 19 pending United States non-provisional patent applications, and 16 issued United States patents. More specifically, as of December 31, 2017, related to our FISH products, we had ownership rights to 11 patents, including 3 pending United States non-provisional patent applications, and 8 issued United States patents. These issued patents began to expire in November 2024 and will be fully expired by March 2032. As of December 31, 2017, related to our Acuitas products, we had ownership rights to 4 patents, including 4 pending United States non-provisional patent applications and no issued United States patents. As of December 31, 2017, related to our other products, we had ownership rights to 20 patents, including 12 pending United States non-provisional patent applications, and 8 issued United States patents related to our other products. These issued patents began to expire in June 2026 and will be fully expired by May 2032. A majority of our issued and exclusively licensed FISH patents expired over the last five years. The remaining 14 exclusively licensed United States FISH patents expire between 2018 and 2023.
 We intend to file additional patent applications in the United States and abroad to strengthen our intellectual property rights; however, our patent applications (including the patent applications listed above) may not result in issued patents in a timely fashion or at all, and we cannot assure investors that any patents that have issued or might issue will protect our technology.
 We require all employees and technical consultants working for us to execute confidentiality agreements, which provide that all confidential information received by them during the course of the employment, consulting or business relationship be kept confidential, except in specified circumstances. Our agreements with our research employees provide that all inventions, discoveries and other types of intellectual property, whether or not patentable or copyrightable, conceived by the individual while he or she is employed by us are assigned to us. We cannot provide any assurance, however, that employees and consultants will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy aspects of our technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
 Regulation
 The following is a summary of the regulations materially affecting our business and operations.
 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988
 
Congress passed CLIA in 1988, which provided CMS authority over all laboratory testing, except research that is performed on humans in the United States. The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group, under the Center for Medicaid and State Operations, has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA program.
 The CLIA program is designed to establish quality laboratory testing by ensuring the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. Under CLIA, a laboratory is a facility that does laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans and used to provide information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or impairment of, or assessment of health. Under the CLIA program, 
 15


laboratories must be certified by the government, satisfy governmental quality and personnel standards, undergo proficiency testing, be subject to inspections and pay fees.
 As a clinical reference laboratory, we are required to hold certain Federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. Under CLIA, we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory examinations we perform and to comply with standards covering personnel, facilities administration, quality systems and proficiency testing.
 We have a current Certificate of Compliance under CLIA and a Medical Laboratory Permit from the State of Maryland to perform clinical testing at our Gaithersburg, Maryland laboratory. To renew our CLIA certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards. The regulatory and compliance standards applicable to the testing we perform may change over time, and any such changes could have a material effect on our business. Our current CLIA certificate expires on October 1, 2019, and our Medical Laboratory Permit expires on June 30, 2018.
 If our clinical laboratory is out of compliance with CLIA requirements, we may be subject to sanctions such as suspension, limitation or revocation of our CLIA certificate, as well as a directed plan of correction, state on-site monitoring, civil money penalties, civil injunctive suit or criminal penalties. We must maintain CLIA compliance and certification in order to perform clinical laboratory tests and report patient test results. If we were to be found out of compliance with CLIA requirements and subjected to sanction, our business could be harmed.
 Federal Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests and Research-Use-Only Products
 
Clinical laboratory tests, like our Acuitas MDRO Gene Test, are regulated under CLIA, as well as by applicable state laws. Historically, most laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, were not subject to FDA regulations applicable to medical devices, although reagents, instruments, software or components provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs may be subject to regulation. The FDA defines the term “laboratory developed test” as an IVD test that is intended for clinical use and designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. We believe that our Acuitas MDRO test products are LDTs. Currently, the FDA exercises enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs such that it does not enforce provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act applicable to IVD devices. In July 2014, due to the increased proliferation of LDTs for complex diagnostic testing, and concerns with several high-risk LDTs related to lack of evidentiary support for claims, erroneous results and falsification of data, the FDA notified Congress that it would issue guidance that, when finalized, would adopt a risk-based framework that would increase FDA oversight of LDTs. As part of this developing framework, the FDA issued draft guidance in October 2014, informing manufacturers of LDTs of its intent to collect information from laboratories regarding their current LDTs and newly developed LDTs through a notification process. In November 2016, the FDA announced that a final LDT Policy guidance would not be issued to allow for further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach, to give FDA’s congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution to LDT regulation. The FDA further elaborated in January 2017 through a discussion paper the agency’s intended framework for potential regulation while also confirming that the FDA intends to continue to exercise enforcement discretion over LDTs at this time.
 Some products are for RUO or for investigational use only, or IUO. RUO and IUO products are not intended for human clinical use and must be properly labeled in accordance with FDA guidance. Claims for RUOs and IUOs related to safety, effectiveness, or clinical utility or that are intended for human diagnostic or prognostic use are prohibited. In November 2013, the FDA issued guidance titled “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only – Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.” This guidance sets forth the requirements to utilize such designations, labeling requirements and acceptable distribution practices, among other requirements.
 Mere placement of an RUO or IUO label on an IVD product does not render the device exempt from otherwise applicable clearance, approval or other requirements. The FDA may determine that the device is intended for use in clinical diagnosis based on other evidence, including how the device is marketed.
 We cannot predict the potential effect the FDA’s current and forthcoming guidance on LDTs and IUOs/RUOs will have on our product offerings or materials used to perform our diagnostic services. While we qualify all materials used in our diagnostic services according to CLIA regulations, we cannot be certain that the FDA might not promulgate rules or issue guidance documents that could affect our ability to purchase materials necessary for the performance of our diagnostic services. Should any of the reagents obtained by us from vendors and used in conducting our diagnostic services be affected by future regulatory actions, our business could be adversely affected by those actions, including increasing the cost of service or delaying, limiting or prohibiting the purchase of reagents necessary to perform the service.
 16


We cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation, including premarket review, will not be required in the future for our surveillance and diagnostic services, whether through additional guidance or regulations issued by the FDA, new enforcement policies adopted by the FDA or new legislation enacted by Congress. On November 17, 2015, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce held one such hearing entitled “Examining the Regulation of Diagnostic Tests and Laboratory Operations.” We expect that new legislative proposals will be introduced from time to time. It is possible that legislation could be enacted into law or regulations or guidance could be issued by the FDA which may result in new or increased regulatory requirements for us to continue to offer our diagnostic services or to develop and introduce new services.
 FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
 
The FDA also has broad authority over the regulation of medical devices marketed for sale in the United States. The FDA regulates the research, clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, promotion, distribution and production of medical devices. The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets.
 Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes: Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are placed into either Class 1 or Class 2.
 Class 1 devices are deemed to pose the lowest risk to the patient. Accordingly, Class 1 devices are subject to the lowest degree of regulatory scrutiny and need only comply with the FDA’s General Controls. The General Controls include compliance with the registration, listing, adverse event reporting requirements, and applicable portions of the QSR as well as the general misbranding and adulteration prohibitions. Unless specifically exempted in the regulations, general controls require a company that intends to market a Class 1 device, like us, to gain clearance for marketing through the 510(k) process. Many Class 1 devices, however, are exempt from 510(k) clearance because the level of risk is low.
 Class 2 devices are considered higher risk devices than Class 1 devices. Class 2 devices are subject to General Controls as well as additional Special Controls. Special Controls may include labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards, and post market surveillance. Generally companies that intend to market Class 2 devices, like us, must comply with applicable regulations and submit a 510(k) premarket submission for review to receive clearance to list and market their devices. The 510(k) must establish substantial equivalence to a predicate device. Some Class 2 devices are exempt from filing a 510(k) but in some instances, Class 2 devices may be required to file a Premarket Approval, or PMA, application.
 Class 3 devices are deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, and require a PMA before commercialization.
 All medical device manufacturers must register their establishments with the FDA; such registrations require the payment of user fees. In addition, both 510(k) premarket submissions and PMA applications are subject to the payment of user fees, paid at the time of submission for FDA review. At this time our CLIA lab in Maryland is not required to register and list with the FDA; however, the Medical Device User Fee Act IV, or MFUFA IV, negotiations currently taking place between the FDA and medical device manufacturers include discussions regarding user fees for clinical laboratories running LDTs. This new fee would be in addition to the user fees required to operate a clinical laboratory.
 The FDA has issued a regulation outlining specific requirements for “specimen transport and storage containers.” “Specimen transport and storage containers” are medical devices if “intended to contain biological specimens, body waste, or body exudate during storage and transport” so that the specimen can be used effectively for diagnostic examination. Since medical devices are subject to registration and listing requirements, the reporting of corrections and removals, and responsible for medical device reporting requirements, if the FDA were to determine that our sample collection container is a medical device, the manufacturer would be required to register and list with the FDA for us to use the container for diagnostic purposes. The specimen collection device would be exempt from premarket review, and from Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements except for recordkeeping and complaint handling requirements, so long as no sterility claims are made, but the manufacturer would still be required to comply with applicable regulations.
 17


510(k) Clearance Pathway
 
If required to obtain 510(k) clearance for our future products or conversion of our Acuitas MDRO test products to diagnostic kits, such tests would be classified as medical devices and we would have to submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications. FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months. On average the review time is approximately six months, but it can take significantly longer than twelve months in some instances, as the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a new 510(k) notice, or a premarket approval, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. We have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements to products that we believe do not require new 510(k) clearances, but we cannot guarantee that the future enhancements, should they occur, will be exempt from new 510(k) clearances.
 Premarket Approval Pathway
 
A PMA application must be submitted if a device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA application process is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, analytical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing, statutory preapproval inspections, and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
 After a PMA application is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the “accepted application,” although, generally, review of the application can take between one and three years, but it may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The preapproval inspections conducted by the FDA include an evaluation of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR, as well as inspections of the clinical trial sites by the Bioresearch Monitoring group to evaluate compliance with good clinical practice and human subject protections. New premarket approval applications or premarket approval application supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. Significant changes to an approved PMA require a 180-day supplement, whereas less substantive changes may utilize a 30-day notice, or the 135-day supplement. Premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. None of our products are currently approved under a premarket approval.
 Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are usually required to support non-exempt Class 1 and Class 2 510(k) premarket submissions. Clinical trials may also be required to support certain marketing claims. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to file an investigational device exemption, or IDE application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to conducting the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as analytical, animal and laboratory testing results, manufacturing information, and an Investigational Review Board, or IRB approved protocol showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA prior to initiation of enrollment of human subjects. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the investigational device exemption application is approved by the FDA. If the clinical trial design is deemed to be “non-significant risk,” the clinical trial may eligible for the “abbreviated” IDE requirements; in some instances IVD clinical trials may be exempt from the more burdensome IDE requirements if certain labeling requirements are met. All clinical trials conducted to support a premarket submission must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations and Federal and state regulations concerning human subject protection, including informed consent, oversight by an IRB and healthcare privacy requirements. A clinical trial may be suspended by the FDA or the IRB review board at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the study. Even if a study is completed, the results of our clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of our product. Similarly, in Europe the clinical study must be approved by the local ethics committee and in some cases, including studies of high-risk devices, by the Ministry of Health in the applicable country.

21st Century Cures Act
 The 21st Century Cures Act contains several sections specific to antimicrobial innovation and antibiotic stewardship, and other provisions related to medical device innovations.  The Company believes that implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act may have a positive impact on the Company’s businesses through facilitating innovation and/or reducing the regulatory burden imposed on medical device manufacturers, especially those involved in antimicrobial susceptibility testing.  The Company cannot predict how and when these initiatives under the Act will be implemented at the federal or state level in which we may do business, or the effect any future regulation will have on us.
 Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
 Numerous regulatory requirements apply to our products classified as devices would continue to apply. These include:
  
• | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the development and manufacturing process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 OpGen’s Woburn, Massachusetts facility is currently registered as an establishment with the FDA. If the LDTs performed in OpGen’s CLIA-certified lab were deemed medical devices by the FDA, then we and any third-party manufacturers of such devices would need to register with the FDA as medical device manufacturers and obtain all necessary state permits or licenses to operate our business. We and any third-party manufacturers would be subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with quality system regulation and other regulations. Our Woburn, Massachusetts facility was inspected by the FDA in 2015. Following such inspection, the FDA issued a report of its findings and observations, typically referred to as “Form 483 observations,” primarily related to our quality systems and testing policies and documentation. We have responded to all inspection observations within the required time frame and are working with the FDA’s Office of Compliance to satisfy the identified deficiencies.
 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, which might include any of the following sanctions: (1) untitled letters, Form 483 observations, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; (2) unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; (3) customer notifications for repair, replacement and refunds; (4) recall, detention or seizure of our products; (5) operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; (6) refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or modified products; (7) operating restrictions; (8) withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; (9) refusal to grant export approval for our products; or (10) criminal prosecution.

After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: all of the relevant elements of the QSR, labeling regulations, restrictions on promotion and advertising, the medical device reporting (which requires the manufacturer to report to the FDA if its device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulations (which requires manufacturers to report certain recalls and field actions to the FDA), and other post-market requirements.
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 
Under HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by healthcare providers, such as us, and by certain vendors of ours, also known as our business associates. The regulations include limitations on the use and disclosure of protected health information and impose notification requirements in the event of a breach of protected health information. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties.
 We have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with these regulations. The requirements under these regulations may change periodically and could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially more costly than under current requirements.
 In addition to Federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality of health information that are applicable to our business. If our business expands internationally, we would be subject to compliance with other laws regarding confidentiality of health information and privacy.
 New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well. We have taken steps to comply with health information privacy requirements to which we are aware that we are subject. However, we can provide no assurance that we are or will remain in compliance with diverse privacy requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.
 Federal and State Physician Self-referral Prohibitions
 As a clinical laboratory, and manufacturer and seller of diagnostic tests, we are subject to the Federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, and to similar restrictions under the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law. Together, these restrictions generally prohibit us from billing a patient or any governmental or private payor for any clinical laboratory services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician’s immediate family, has an investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition.
 Both the Stark Law and the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law contain an exception for compensation paid to a physician for personal services rendered by the physician. We have compensation arrangements with a number of physicians for personal services, such as clinical advisory board services, speaking engagements and other consulting activities. We have structured these arrangements with terms intended to comply with the requirements of the personal services exception to the Stark Law and the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law.
 However, we cannot be certain that regulators would find these arrangements to be in compliance with the Stark Law, the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law, or similar state laws. We would be required to refund any payments we receive pursuant to a referral prohibited by these laws to the patient, the payor or the Medicare program, as applicable.
 
Sanctions for a violation of the Stark Law include the following:
 
 
• | denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | possible exclusion from Federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibition.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
20


These prohibitions apply regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. No finding of intent to violate the Stark Law is required for a violation. In addition, knowing violations of the Stark Law may also serve as the basis for liability under the Federal False Claims Act, which prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. Government.
 
Further, if we submit claims in violation of the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law, we can be held liable to the payer for any reimbursement received for the services by us. Finally, other states have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply that differ from those imposed by Federal and Maryland law. While we have attempted to comply with the Stark Law and the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law, it is possible that some of our financial arrangements with physicians could be subject to regulatory scrutiny at some point in the future, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be found to be in compliance with these laws following any such regulatory review.
 Federal and State Anti-Kickback Laws
 
The Federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Law makes it a felony for a person or entity, including a laboratory, to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any Federal healthcare program. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Law may result in imprisonment for up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 in the case of individuals and $500,000 in the case of organizations. Convictions under the Anti-Kickback Law result in mandatory exclusion from Federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. In addition, HHS has the authority to impose civil assessments and fines and to exclude healthcare providers and others engaged in prohibited activities from Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal healthcare programs. Actions which violate the Anti-Kickback Law also incur liability under the Federal False Claims Act.
 Although the Anti-Kickback Law applies only to Federal healthcare programs, a number of states, including Maryland, have passed statutes substantially similar to the Anti-Kickback Law pursuant to which similar types of prohibitions are made applicable to all other health plans and third-party payers. Violations of Maryland’s anti-kickback law are punishable by tiered criminal penalties based on the crime with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and fines of up to $200,000, or both. Civil penalties include three times the amount of any overpayment made in violation of the statute.
 Federal and state law enforcement authorities scrutinize arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to induce patient care referrals or induce the purchase or prescribing of particular products or services. The law enforcement authorities, the courts and Congress have also demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and actual or potential referral sources. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-Kickback Law, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases.
 In addition to statutory exceptions to the Anti-Kickback Law, regulations provide for a number of safe harbors. If an arrangement meets the provisions of a safe harbor, it is deemed not to violate the Anti-Kickback Law. An arrangement must fully comply with each element of an applicable safe harbor in order to qualify for protection. There are no regulatory safe harbors to the Maryland anti-kickback law.
 Among the safe harbors that may be relevant to us is the discount safe harbor. The discount safe harbor potentially applies to discounts provided by providers and suppliers, including laboratories, to physicians or institutions. If the terms of the discount safe harbor are met, the discounts will not be considered prohibited remuneration under the Anti-Kickback Law. Maryland does not have a discount safe harbor.
 The personal services safe harbor to the Anti-Kickback Law provides that remuneration paid to a referral source for personal services will not violate the Anti-Kickback Law provided all of the elements of that safe harbor are met. One element is that if the agreement is intended to provide for the services of the physician on a periodic, sporadic or part-time basis, rather than on a full-time basis for the term of the agreement, the agreement must specify exactly the schedule of such intervals, their precise length, and the exact charge for such intervals.
 Our personal services arrangements with some physicians may not meet the specific requirement of this safe harbor that the agreement specify exactly the schedule of the intervals of time to be spent on the services because the nature of the services, such as speaking engagements, does not lend itself to exact scheduling and therefore meeting this element of the personal services safe harbor is impractical. Failure to meet the terms of the safe harbor does not render an arrangement illegal. Rather, the government may evaluate such arrangements on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all facts and circumstances.
 21


While we believe that we are in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Law and the Maryland anti-kickback law, there can be no assurance that our relationships with physicians, academic institutions and other customers will not be subject to investigation or challenge under such laws. If imposed for any reason, sanctions under the Anti-Kickback Law and the Maryland anti-kickback law could have a negative effect on our business.
 Other Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
In addition to the requirements discussed above, several other healthcare fraud and abuse laws could have an effect on our business. For example, provisions of the Social Security Act permit Medicare and Medicaid to exclude an entity that charges the Federal healthcare programs substantially in excess of its usual charges for its services. The terms “usual charge” and “substantially in excess” are ambiguous and subject to varying interpretations.
 Further, the Federal False Claims Act prohibits a person from knowingly submitting a claim, making a false record or statement in order to secure payment or retaining an overpayment by the Federal government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the Federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud, also known as qui tam lawsuits. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. It is not uncommon for qui tam lawsuits to be filed by employees, competitors or consultants.
 Finally, the Social Security Act includes its own provisions that prohibit the filing of false claims or submitting false statements in order to obtain payment. Violation of these provisions may result in fines, imprisonment or both, and possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid programs. Maryland has an analogous state false claims act applicable to state health plans and programs, as do many other states.
 Maryland Laboratory Licensing
 
Maryland requires that any site that performs clinical laboratory testing located in the state of Maryland, with limited exceptions, must be licensed by the state, in addition to meeting Federal CLIA requirements. As such, our laboratory in Gaithersburg, Maryland holds a current Maryland license and is subject to on-site surveys by Maryland’s Office of Health Care Quality. Our license was renewed in 2016 and will expire in June 2018.
Other States’ Laboratory Licensing
 In addition to Maryland, other states including California, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia, require licensing of out-of-state laboratories under certain circumstances. We have obtained licenses to receive specimens from Pennsylvania, Florida, and New York. We intend to obtain licenses from additional states and jurisdictions where we believe we are required to be licensed, and believe we are in compliance with applicable licensing laws. 
 From time to time, we may become aware of other states that require out-of-state laboratories to obtain licensure in order to accept specimens from the state, and it is possible that other states do have such requirements or will have such requirements in the future. If we identify any other state with such requirements or if we are contacted by any other state advising us of such requirements, we intend to comply with such requirements.
 
International Regulation
 
Sales of diagnostic tests like our Acuitas MDRO test products outside the United States would be subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries, we would need to obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. OpGen’s Woburn, Massachusetts facility is currently ISO 13485 certified; the facility passed an inspection by our Notified Body in January 2017. While such certification is not required to distribute products internationally, the ISO 13485 certification implies that we are in compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements to distribute our medical devices internationally. OpGen currently distributes products in the European Union through its Denmark office. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ significantly. If we elect to, or are required to, seek clearance of or approval for any of our products from the FDA, we may be able to commercialize such products with shorter lead time in international markets, but would need to establish international operations in order to do so.
 22


Environmental Matters
 Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) which subject us to a variety of Federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of these regulations provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others’, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or new regulations will affect our business, operations or the cost of compliance.
