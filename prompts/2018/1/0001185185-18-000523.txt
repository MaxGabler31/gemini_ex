ITEM 1. Business
Our History
 
We (or the “Company”) were initially formed in June 1979 as Alpha Solarco Inc., a Colorado corporation. From June 1979 through February 2003, we were either inactive or involved in discontinued business ventures. We changed our name to Fiber Application Systems Technology, Ltd in February 2003. In January 2004, we changed our state of incorporation by merging into Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. (IVFH), a Florida corporation formed for that purpose. As a result of the merger, we changed our name to that of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. In January 2004, we also acquired Food Innovations, Inc. (“FII” or “Food Innovations”), a Florida corporation, for 500,000 shares of our common stock.
 
On May 18, 2012, the Company executed a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Artisan Specialty Foods, Inc., an Illinois corporation (“Artisan”), from its owner, Mr. David Vohaska.  The purchase price was $1.2 million, with up to another $300,000 (with a fair value of $131,000) payable in the event certain financial milestones are met over the next one or two years. Those milestones have been met. 
 
 On November 2, 2012, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Haley Acquisition”) with The Haley Group, LLC whereby we acquired all existing assets of The Haley Group, LLC and its customers. The Haley Acquisition was valued at a total cost of $119,645.  On June 30, 2014, pursuant to a purchase agreement, the Company purchased 100% of the membership interest of Organic Food Brokers, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“OFB”), for $300,000, 100,000 4 year options at a price of $1.46 per share, and up to an additional $225,000 in earn-outs if certain milestones are met. Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of January 1, 2017 the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Oasis Sales Corp. (“Oasis”), purchased substantially all of the assets of Oasis Sales and Marketing, L.L.C. for $300,000 cash;  a $200,000 structured equity instrument   which can be paid in cash or shares of the Company stock at the Company’s option, anytime under certain conditions, or is automatically payable via the issuance of 200,000 shares if the Company’s shares close above $1.00 for ten consecutive days; a $100,000 note;  and up to an additional $400,000 in earn-outs over two years if certain milestones are met.  The Agreement also contains claw-back provisions if certain revenue conditions are not met.
 
On August 15, 2014, pursuant to a merger agreement (the “Fresh Diet Merger Agreement”), the Company acquired The Fresh Diet, Inc. (“The Fresh Diet” or “FD”) through a reverse triangular merger as the registrant created a subsidiary corporation (FD Acquisition Corp) that merged with and into FD with FD being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase price consisted of 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $14,000,000. The majority of FD’s current liabilities consisted of approximately $3.8 million of deferred revenues and approximately $2.1 million in short term commercial loans and there was additional ordinary course of business expenses such as trade payables, payroll and sales taxes which vary from month to month. In addition, it had some long-term obligations the bulk of which consisted of interest free loans from FD’s former shareholders in the amount of approximately $2.2 million which were not due for three years. Effective February 23, 2016, the Company closed a transaction to sell 90% of its ownership in FD to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD who was appointed Interim CEO of FD on February 9, 2016.  The consideration to the Company consisted primarily of a restructuring of our loans, which includes the ability to convert to additional amounts of FD under certain circumstances. There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations.
 
Effective January 24, 2018, pursuant to an asset acquisition agreement (the “iGourmet Asset Acquisition Agreement”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, Innovative Gourmet LLC, acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of iGourmet LLC and iGourmet NY LLC, privately-held New York limited liability companies located in West Pittston, Pennsylvania  and engaged in the sale, marketing, and distribution of specialty food and specialty food items through www.igourmet.com, online marketplaces, additional  direct-to-consumer platforms, distribution to foodservice, retail stores and other wholesale accounts, pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement.

Overall, our business activities are focused around the distribution or the enabling of distribution of high quality, unique specialty food and food related products ranging from specialty foodservice products to Consumer Packaged Goods (“CPG”) products through a variety of sales channels.   Since its incorporation, the Company primarily through FII’s relationship with the producers, growers, and makers of thousands of unique specialty foodservice products and through its relationship with US Foods, Inc.  (“U.S. Foods” or “USF”), has been in the business of providing premium restaurants, within 24 – 72 hours, with the freshest origin-specific perishable, and healthcare products shipped directly from our network of vendors and from our warehouses. Our customers include restaurants, hotels, country clubs, national chain accounts, casinos, hospitals and catering houses.

GFG is focused on expanding the Company’s program offerings to additional customers.  In our business model, we receive orders from our customers and then work closely with our suppliers and our warehouse facilities to have the orders fulfilled.  In order to maintain freshness and quality, we carefully select our suppliers based upon, among other factors, their quality, uniqueness, reliability and access to overnight courier services.

 Customer Service and Logistics
 
Our “live” chef-driven customer service department is available by telephone Monday through Thursday, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Florida time. The customer service department is made up of a team of  chefs and culinary experts, including a team of culinary trained chefs,  who are full-time employees of the Company, and who are experienced in all aspects of perishable and specialty products. By employing chefs and culinary experts to handle customer service, we are able to provide our customers with extensive information about our products, including:

● | Flavor profile and eating qualities 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------
● | Recipe and usage ideas 
● | Origin, seasonality, and availability 
● | Cross utilization ideas and complementary uses of products

 
Our logistics team manages the shipping and delivery process of every package to ensure timely delivery of products to our customers. The logistics manager receives shipping information on all products ordered, and packages are monitored from origin to delivery. In the event that delivery service is interrupted, our logistics department begins the process of expediting the package to its destination or potentially reshipping the package with a goal of 100% customer satisfaction for our customers. Our logistics manager works directly with our suppliers on an ongoing basis, to ensure that the appropriate packaging and shipping specifications are in place at all times.
 
Relationship with U.S. Foods
 
We have historically sold the majority of our products, $29,854,522 and $25,434,695  for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively (72% of total sales in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016) through a distributor relationship between FII and Next Day Gourmet, L.P., a subsidiary of U.S. Foods, a leading broadline distributor. On January 26, 2015 we executed a contract between Food Innovations, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and U.S. Foods.  The term of the Agreement is from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 and provides for a limited number of automatic annual renewals thereafter if no party gives the other 30 days’ notice of its intent not to renew. Based on the terms, the Agreement was extended through December 31, 2018. Effective January 1, 2018 the Agreement was further amended to remove the cap on renewals, and provide for an unlimited number of additional 12-month terms unless either party notifies the other in writing, 30 days prior to the end date, of its intent not to renew.
 
Growth Strategy
 
While the U.S. economic recovery remains fragile, there appears to be much for the specialty food industry to celebrate. Amidst efforts to increase overall efficiency and success, the specialty food industry has experienced general growth in sales through manufacture, retail, and distribution.  According to the State of the Specialty Food Industry report completed by the Specialty Food Association and Mintel in 2017, specialty food sales hit $127 billion in the U.S. in 2016 with a 15% percent growth in dollar sales and a 13.1 percent increase in unit sales since 2014.  For our continued growth within the specialty foodservice industry and the consumer and chef specialty food industry, we value and strive for a high level of personal customer service, premium quality products, new product introduction and innovation, and continued expansion of our marketing activities with new and existing customers in both the specialty foodservice space and the consumer specialty food space.
 
We anticipate attempting to grow our current specialty foodservice business both through increased sales of existing products to our existing foodservice customers, the introduction of new products to our foodservice customers, increasing our foodservice customer base, and through further entry into markets such as the  consumer market and other markets through a variety of potential sales channels, and sales partnerships and directly online including leveraging the recently acquired assets of iGourmet LLC toward further expansion of our sales and distribution channels.
 
In addition to attempting to grow our current business, we believe that there are lateral opportunities in the food industry. We may consider the possibility of acquiring a specialty food manufacturer, or specialty food distributor at some future point in time. We anticipate that, given our current cash flow levels, any acquisition could potentially involve the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or third party financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms. No acquisition will be consummated without thorough due diligence. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify and successfully conclude negotiations with any potential target.

 General economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food-prepared-away-from-home and, in turn, can impact our customers and our sales. We believe the current general economic conditions, including pressure on consumer disposable income, may contribute to a slow or declining growth in the overall broadline foodservice market but toward growth in the specialty foodservice and specialty CPG market.  We intend to continue our efforts to expand our market share and grow earnings by focusing on sales growth, margin management, expansion of distribution channels, productivity gains and supply chain management, and product and service differentiation.
Competition
 
While we face intense competition in the marketing of our products and services, it is our belief that there is no other single company in the United States that offers such a broad range of customer service oriented, quality, chef driven products and specialty gourmet products, for delivery from same day to 72 hours.  Our primary competition in both areas is from local purveyors that supply a limited local market and have a limited range of products and from the other specialty gourmet distributors, and from the national, regional or local expansion of specialty and non-specialty food distributers. In addition , many purveyors are well established, have reputations for success in the development and marketing of these types of products and services and have significantly greater financial, marketing, distribution, personnel and other resources. These financial and other capabilities permit such companies to implement extensive advertising and promotional campaigns, both generally and in response to efforts by additional competitors such as us, to enter into new markets and introduce new products and services.
Insurance
 
We maintain a general liability insurance policy with a per occurrence limit of $1,000,000 and aggregate policy covering $2,000,000 of liability and non-owned automobile personal injury coverage with a limit of $1,000,000. The Company also carried an Umbrella policy of up to $10,000,000 which covers all entities except Artisan; Artisan carries a separate Umbrella policy of up to $5,000,000. Such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential claims against us and additional insurance may not be available in the future at a reasonable price.
Government Regulation
 
Various federal and state laws currently exist, and more are sure to be adopted, regulating the delivery of fresh food products. We require all third-party vendors to certify that they maintain at least $3,000,000 liability insurance coverage and compliance with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP), an FDA- and USDA-mandated food safety program, or a similar standard. Any changes in the government regulation of delivering of fresh food products that hinders our current ability and/or cost to deliver fresh products, could adversely impact our net revenues and gross margins and, therefore, our profitability and cash flows could also be adversely affected.
Employees
 
We currently employ 58 full-time employees, including 6 chefs and 2 executive officers. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. None of our employees are represented by a union.

Transactions with a major customer and related economic dependence information is set forth (1) following our discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources, (2) Under the heading Major Customer in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, (3) in Business – Relationship with U.S. Foods, (4) as the second item under Risk Factors.
