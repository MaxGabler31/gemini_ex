Item 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
Newgioco Group, Inc. ("Newgioco Group" or "the Company") was incorporated in the state of Delaware on August 26, 1998 as Pender International Inc. On September 30, 2005, the Company changed its name to Empire Global Corp., and on July 20, 2016 changed its name to Newgioco Group, Inc.
 
The Company maintains its principal executive offices headquartered in Toronto, Canada with wholly owned subsidiaries in Italy and Austria.
 
Our subsidiaries include: Multigioco Srl (“Multigioco”) which was acquired on August 15, 2014, Rifa Srl (“Rifa”) which was acquired on January 1, 2015, as well as Ulisse Gmbh (“Ulisse”) and Odissea Betriebsinformatik Beratung Gmbh (“Odissea”) which were both acquired on July 1, 2016.
 
Newgioco Group is now a vertically integrated company which owns and operates an innovative Betting Platform Software (“BPS”) and offering a complete suite of online and offline leisure gaming services including a variety of lottery and casino gaming, as well as sports betting products through a distribution network of retail betting locations situated throughout Italy. The Company intends to grow through acquisitions and organic development of its distribution network in Italy in addition to exploring new opportunities in regulated gaming markets internationally.
 
Operations are carried out under an online gaming license regulated by the Agenzia Delle Dogane e dei Monopoli (“ADM”), formerly known as the “AAMS” (Amministrazione Autonoma Monopoli dei Stato), in Italy. The Company's revenue streams, through our subsidiaries Multigioco, Rifa and Ulisse consist of wagering and gaming income from online through the internet and land-based (or "offline") in neighborhood betting shops situated throughout Italy. The product offering includes a variety of online and offline lottery and casino gaming, as well as sports betting and online poker. Our internet based sports bet wagers are processed by our Odissea subsidiary betting platform while all other online products such as casino, poker, card games, and lotto are processed through the Microgame betting platform. Land-based sports bet wagers, horse racing and virtual sports are processed through the SNAITECH betting platform. The Company's revenue stream through our subsidiary Odissea consists of providing BOS services to third party operators on a business-to-business basis.
 
On December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 800 web-based betting shops, approximately 180 land-based betting shops operating under its license. Please refer to the "Distribution Method for Products or Services" section for a detailed description of web-based and land-based betting shops.
 
History
 
On August 15, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 100% ownership in Multigioco, a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Italy and is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Multigioco was granted its ADM Comunitaria GAD (Online Gaming) license on July 4, 2012. As a result of the acquisition of Multigioco, our principal business became a licensed leisure gaming operator offering web-based and land-based sports betting, lottery and gaming products for our customers.
 
Multigioco was organized under the laws of the Republic of Italy on November 4, 2010. It was formed by the founder of Newgioco Srl (a company incorporated in Italy), Beniamino Gianfelici and Doriana Gianfelici, the father-in-law and spouse respectively of our President, Alessandro Marcelli, with Newgioco Srl holding a 66% interest and Doriana Gianfelici holding a 34% interest in Multigioco, respectively.
 
Newgioco Srl is an Italian gaming company which is 50% owned by Laura Tabacco, an Italian citizen, and 50% owned by Beniamino Gianfelici who, along with his daughter, owned 100% of Multigioco prior to its acquisition by the Company.
 
Pursuant to the agreement to acquire Multigioco, the shareholders of Multigioco had the option to repurchase the shares issued, in whole or in part, no later than 90 days from the closing of the agreement. On October 31, 2014, the Company paid EUR 490,000 (approximately U.S. $620,700) to reacquire 49% (or 980,000) of the shares issued to acquire Multigioco. The parties have informally agreed to extend the option indefinitely.

On January 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Rifa through Multigioco and purchased offline gaming assets from Newgioco Srl, which included a Bersani license along with 3 corner rights to operate under Multigioco and Rifa purchased 1 agency right from Newgioco Srl to operate under Rifa's Monti license. Pursuant to the agreement, Rifa assumed the lease on the agency premises and also acquired the equipment assets within the agency. On June 1, 2015, the Company opened its second agency location in Rome under Rifa.
 
On July 1, 2016, we completed the acquisitions of Ulisse Gmbh, an Austrian gaming company, increasing the land-based footprint of the Company by 107 agency locations in Italy as well as Odissea Betriebsinformatik Beratung Gmbh, an Austrian gaming technology company, acquiring a proprietary BPS and making the Company a fully integrated gaming operator.
 
Pursuant to the agreements to acquire Ulisse and Odissea, upon completion of the Italian license auction and upon certification of the BPS by the Italian gaming regulator, respectively, the sellers of Ulisse and Odissea may sell back to the Company 50% of the shares of common stock of the Company received as consideration for the purchase price or 1,665,600 shares and 4,386,100 shares respectively at a fixed price of U.S. $0.50 per share.
 
During the period covered by this report, the Company acquired approximately 60 additional CED agency locations. Our subsidiaries now own a proprietary BPS, an online GAD license with approximately 800 web-based shops (Punti Virtuali di Ricarica), a Bersani license #4070 with 7 corner (Punto Sportivo) rights, as well as a Monti license #4583 with 2 agency (Negozio Sportivo) rights and 165 CED agency locations.
 
OUR STRATEGY
 
Our growth plan is to expand our business both in absolute and in relative terms.
 
Absolute growth will be achieved by organic development of our current target audience within our operating territories by conducting a tactical business analysis and establishing standard operating procedures and implementing a marketing strategy we refer to as our "Rebranding Blueprint" related to target marketing as outlined below. We believe that relative growth will be achieved through a consolidation architecture as we accumulate market share through the expansion of our land-based location rights and acquisitions of competing operators interested in our innovative BPS.
 
Conduct a tactical business process analysis
 
We intend to conduct a thorough review of the Italian gaming business plan, which may reveal opportunities to improve profitability through a broad range of business process models and strategies as well as techniques to trade, transfer or dispose of unproductive shops, high cost locations, low margin products and venues which may carry more risk than reward or acquire or combine additional licenses while terminating or selling others that are deemed unproductive, low margin, high risk or expensive.
 
Our strategy is to bring operators in the fragmented Italian gaming market under the ownership of our company and provide professional management and additional resources and services as described below, and seek to capitalize on the license tender auction known in Italy as the “Bando di Gara” for land-based license renewal that is expected to occur within the 24 months following the date of this report. By doing so, we believe that we can continue to improve on our services, develop our competitive advantage and build a national brand for gaming, wagering and entertainment.
 
Establish Standard Operating Procedures ("SOP's") and best practices
 
After acquiring a certain group of target gaming operators, we intend to continue their businesses as before while implementing SOP's. The purpose of these SOP's is higher, more transparent control over operations. Consolidating several companies under our control will provide an opportunity to implement operating efficiencies that cannot be achieved by smaller independent operators. We expect to save costs in regulatory compliance, marketing, management, accounting, human resource, and legal services. Creating a standardized control system will be a major cost savings measure as Newgioco Group grows, and is therefore considered an essential part of the Company's strategy.
 
Implement our Newgioco Rebranding Blueprint with operators acquired through consolidation
 
In addition to continuing existing business practices of the operators, implementing SOP's and best practices as described above, we also intend to augment the services provided by our operators by implementing our Newgioco Rebranding Blueprint with a view to achieving critical mass such that we can implement in-house administration of technology through our own BPS.
 
5


Our Newgioco Rebranding Blueprint contemplates target marketing of specific verticals within our existing client base as well as anticipated new clients assumed through acquisitions and clients that are currently patrons of competitors or of operators that may cease operations.
 
Consolidation Architecture
 
If the acquisition of a target operator involves a transfer of assets, it is likely that not all, if any, licenses or permits or other authorizations will be allowed to be transferred to a new entity along with the assets. Some of the operators we are evaluating maintain one or more licenses. It is also possible that our license may be leveraged, sold or transferred in a transaction for another license or licenses offering benefits that might fit a revised or remodeled business plan in the future. Although these concepts may be considered as part of our business development, we cannot provide any assurance that any such transaction will occur.
 
When considering the acquisition of a target operator, the license associated with the location rights (either a Monti or Bersani license described elsewhere in this report) dictates the method of acquisition. Certain conditions apply to a proposed sale and transfer of the specific license according to the legislative decrees associated with each Monti and Bersani licenses. In the case of Bersani licenses, any existing licensee or qualified acquirer (meaning a person or entity approved by the ADM) may acquire a Bersani license from the previous holder by simply transferring the license from the seller to the buyer. However, Monti licenses cannot be bifurcated from the corporate entity which was initially granted the Monti license unless the buyer is currently a Monti licensed legal entity or person. Instead, the acquirer, if not currently a Monti licensed entity, must acquire the licensed corporate entity, which may or may not have existing gaming location rights or business activity.
 
Addition of other services and facilities
 
In addition to complementing gaming offerings originally provided by our acquired operators with our Newgioco branding, we intend to add new products and services with the assistance of gaming specialists, software providers and market research professionals. Additional revenues can be realized by establishing facilities such as marketing centers and kiosks.

We have exceeded our guidance over the past 24 months and currently service approximately 50,000 active client accounts and estimate that our base will increase to over 100,000 in 2 years based on projections supplied by both organic growth and acquisition of existing businesses. These clients range in age from 18 through 79 and are a mix of 70% male/30% female. In addition, we separate our revenue source to (a) sports betting, (b) casino and card game betting and (c) poker players. Our in-house ad-hoc analysis finds that sports betting is more popular among our customer base. In addition, sports betting is our most profitable revenue stream yielding the highest percentage of our Gross Gaming Revenue ("GGR") at 51% of revenues, which is representative of industry metrics when measured by completed seasons on a year over year basis.
 
Our internal analysis also shows different gaming patterns emerge from our male and female patrons. Male players prefer sports-bets, while about 10% of them also explore casino and poker. Alternatively, female players prefer casino and bingo while only 1% try our other game offerings like poker, sports-bets or lotteries.
 
Sports-Bet: We currently have an average of 5,500 players per month (about 22% of our total gaming accounts) that place at least 3 bets per week, for a total of 12 bets per month per player. The total number of monthly bets on our license averages between 160,000 and 180,000 tickets. The average of the amount played per ticket is EUR 7.6 (approximately U.S. $9) such that each player that places 12 bet-spends EUR 76.8 (approximately U.S. $86) per month.
 
Casino: We have an average of 900 unique players participating in casino games (generally about 2.5% of all gaming accounts and 8.6% of the sports-bet players), with approximately 26% of players playing on our mobile platform. Each casino player generates coin-in revenue of EUR 3,000 (approximately U.S. $3,389) per month which represents a profit of EUR 94 (approximately U.S. $106) per player per month. The profit of $106 is also the metric used to measure our casino performance in "spending" of a casino player.
 
Poker: We have an average of 1,080 unique players participating in poker games through our website (about 3% of all gaming account and 9.8% of the sports-bet players) per month. Each poker player generates coin-in revenue of EUR 2,896 (approximately U.S. $3,271) per month which represents a profit of EUR 103 (approximately U.S. $116) per player per month. We also use the profit metric of EUR 103 (approximately U.S. $116) to measure our casino performance in "spending" of a poker player.
 
Most of our patrons are located throughout Italy including Sardinia with the highest concentrations in larger centers such as Rome and Naples.
 
We expect that the individual patrons from the operators we acquire will continue to utilize our services. The operators we are now evaluating or attempting to acquire have existing revenues from individuals who frequent their establishments and venues. In addition to this base of customers, we plan to pursue additional licenses, contracts and relationships with institutions, both in the private and public sectors that will attract and secure new bettors that use the services of competitors.
 
Gaming Product Offerings
 
Our land-based locations generally offer only sports betting, virtual sports betting, horse racing and physical slots, while our website and shops offer a full suite of gaming products which include:

- | Sports Betting: Considered the largest and most well-known industry segment offering both pre-live and live in-game betting opportunities for a wide variety of sports.

Distribution Methods for Products or Services
 
In Italy, gaming products and services are offered through any of three distribution methods: agencies, corners, or websites. Regardless of the distribution method, licensed operators in Italy must be connected to the ADM network using an intermediary betting software platform such as Microgame S.p.A ("Microgame") or our own Odissea BPS. Only a single license is required to operate a website based gaming service, which Multigioco owns, while each offline agency and corner must have a separate license right assigned to each location.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company used a combination of all three distribution methods as described in greater detail below. The Company’s reach is currently approximately 50,000 online user accounts, 800 web café, and 180 land-based locations. We expect to continue growing our distribution as we develop our business in Italy through additional acquisitions. The following describes the three distribution methods in Italy:
 

1. | Negozio Sportivo ("NS"; "agency" or "arcade") (translated as Sporting Store): An agency is an arcade location that is a gaming specific venue meeting strict regulatory standards. An agency must have 70% of its square-footage dedicated specifically to gaming space in addition to having a cash cage, thereby creating an 'arcade' like facility for the primary purpose of gaming and gaming related revenues.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Punto Sportivo ("PS" or corner) (translated as Sporting Point): A corner is distinguished from an agency insofar as the principal business situated at the location is primarily other than gaming (such as a coffee shop or bakery) with a terminal connected to the ADM network. The primary purpose of the facility is not gaming, and it only sections a small 'corner' for extra cash flow in exchange for a fee and/or commission. Specifically, a maximum of 30% of floor space of a corner location can be dedicated to gaming.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Punti Virtuali di Recarica ("PVR"; web-based betting shops "shops"; "web cafe" or "websites") (translated as Virtual Reload Points): A web shop is a physical location where a single or multiple computers are connected to the web and directed to our website. Customers can access our website through the computers set up at the web shop and may also make cash deposits that are credited electronically to their online gaming accounts (i.e. virtual account reloading).
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Websites
 
The Company’s corporate website is www.newgiocogroup.com where general corporate information about us can be found as well as links to our Company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as information on our stock at OTC Markets, LLC. In addition, the Company provides information for investors including corporate governance policies and recent press releases.
 
Multigioco's main gaming website www.newgioco.it currently operates under a third party Service Provider Agreement with Microgame to develop and host our website layout, design and functionality. Microgame provides and operates all aspects of the Newgioco online gaming website including: servers, routers, software development (for the Newgioco branded website operations), sportsbook trading, telephone betting, licensing, website hosting, payment solutions, security, and the first line of gaming related customer support needs.
 
Information about our Betting Platform Software can be found on Odissea’s website at www.odissea.at which provides general information and the services provided by Odissea as well as contact information.
 
Multigioco’s client-facing websites
 
Multigioco websites are tailored for the Italian gaming market. The Company maintains a web-based platform directly under the branded website newgioco.it (the main "channel") serving players and shops respectively. There are some variations in website style because Multigioco offers different services through distinctive marketing campaigns:
 

- | newgioco.it is mainly devoted to shops (locations), such that marketing for this brand is dedicated to webshop campaigns, branding, and proposals or marketing for prospective operators to become a "Newgioco Shop";
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | originalbet.it, timetobet.it, clubgames.it, mixbet.it, imperialbet.it, quibet.it and lovingbet.it (agent web skins) are dedicated to the end-user (players), by focusing on campaigns and gaming offerings directed at players, such as welcome bonuses, rake back for poker players, etc.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The websites are only published in the Italian language. Multigioco may include additional languages if it is determined that such services are commercially viable and if we agree to pay the related development fees. We do not have any immediate plans to expand our website to include additional languages at present.
 
8


The ADM requires that all websites are owned only by the license holder. We own our branded website url www.newgioco.it in accordance with our ADM licensing requirements and either directly operate the websites or alternatively contract the websites to third party agents or promoters operating under the web skin urls www.original bet.it, timetobet.it, clubgames.it, mixbet.it, imperialbet.it, quibet.it (see Note a) and www.lovingbet.it (see Note b).
 
Note (a): A Landing page refers to a webpage that is generally owned by a promoter (which can also be referred to as a betting shop) which redirects their marketing (social network, friends or other forms of marketing) to this webpage. Apart from a few advertisements, the landing page links patrons to sign-up or register directly on the newgioco.it main page except that a promotional code is tied to the link, such that the web promoter can funnel his marketing through a subnet. In the Italian market, the entire subnet (a subnet is a logical grouping of connected network devices. Nodes on a subnet tend to be located in close physical proximity to each other such as on a LAN) must be connected to the ADM network.
 
Note (b): A White-label page is a complete gaming website (similar to the main website of the licenser (in our case Multigioco)) but with the interface and logo of the promoter (such as LovingBet). The promoter earns fees according to the turnover generated through their website.
 
In relation to the third party or rented websites, the promoter ("partner", "shop" or "agent") is responsible for marketing strategies, administration and costs. The promoter may utilize special promotions, draws and incentives to drive players to their website to increase gaming turnover or visits. Generally, these promoters operate in areas that are remote or distant from our central operations based in Rome, therefore, some promotions may be local events in the jurisdiction surrounding the "home base" of the promoter. The relationship with local shops and players from the promoter region remains directly with the promoter since there could be regional nuances that attract their clientele to our gaming offerings. However, the gaming business belongs to the underlying licensor or, in our case, Multigioco and is included in our overall financial results as gaming turnover.
 
The Promoter does not have any direct access to Multigioco client gaming accounts and is therefore not legally responsible or liable for maintaining gaming account balances. As a result, the licensor is legally responsible for compliance and client gaming account control, and is also legally required to ensure that all payouts due to players are credited to each players' gaming account and are available to players within 7 working days of the completion of the play.
 
Please refer to the section entitled CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed August 19, 2014 for additional information on our Service Provider Agreement with Microgame, White-label Services Agreements and landing pages.
 
While the www.newgioco.it website offers wagering in many categories outside of sports, we intend to capture a larger share of the Italian market by focusing on the Serie A, B, and C soccer, online poker, online casino and slots, skill games, virtual sports as well as Italian horse racing.
 
Otherwise, the Company offers a sufficiently diverse product and service offerings through our websites and intends to focus on creating in-house cost savings and synergies by undertaking strategic acquisitions and following a strict internal development plan.
 
Employees
 
Our current CEO provides day-to-day operations and management services at the Company's head office. Management expects to use consultants, attorneys, and accountants as necessary, and does not anticipate a need to engage any full-time employees in our head office so long as it is seeking and evaluating business opportunities.
 
On March 29, 2018, Multigioco employed 10 full time and 5 part time employees at its head office and approximately 20 outside commissioned sales agents that service our remote shops and venues in the field, while Odissea employed 14 full time staff, and Ulisse employed 10 full time staff.
 
Research and Development
 
Neither the Company, nor its subsidiaries, engage in research and development activities.

FACTORS AFFECTING OUR MARKET
 
Government Regulations - General
 
The following information is presented with the understanding that we have now acquired gaming operators in Italy with an online license expiring in 2021 and a land-based license prolonged until the completion of the license renewal auction, and therefore our business is subject to the regulations described below. For this discussion, when we mention "our operators" or "our facilities" or operators or facilities that we "own", it is in reference to operators or facilities that we have acquired and may acquire in the course of our business in the future, assuming that we are able to acquire any additional operators at all.
 
Under Criminal Law in Italy, all gambling is illegal regardless of where it is organized. However, the law recognizes there is a difference with games of chance and games where the outcome depends on the player's skills. Sports-betting, lotteries and some other activities fall into the category of legal and regulated gaming activities, under which our business operations fall.
 
In Italy, the ADM (the State Agency of Customs and Monopolies) is granted the power to issue licenses and regulate gaming activities.
 
Beginning in 1992, some forms of gaming activities were deregulated by government decree under certain conditions to avoid potentially negative social effects associated with the industry. In 2006, beginning with a series of licenses colloquially termed as "Bersani" Licenses which is expected to renew under license tender in 2018, the ADM implemented certain amendments with a view to liberalize the market such as:
 

- | Legalization of real-money skill games and betting exchanges or 'books';
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Opening of the Italian gaming market to operators from EU and EFTA countries (on condition they meet certain requirements); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Initiating a new license tender process intended to curb the network of offline betting establishments and also provided a possibility for online gaming operators to offer their services on a legal basis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
New milestones were reached by Italian legislation in 2006 which regulated the use of the internet as a direct gaming distribution channel in Italy. The Finance Act 2007, which legalized card games in the form of tournaments with stakes equal only to tournament entry fees, and also the "Comunitaria" decree in February 2011, which regulated cash poker games and online casino games also amended laws introduced in the previous Bersani version of the decree. Licenses issued pursuant to this new decree will expire in 2021 and renew under a new tender notice procedures.
 
See the section captioned "Risk Factors" for additional information and risks we face as operators in the regulated gaming industry.
 
Permits, Authorizations and Licenses
 
Italy maintains a federal legislated policy aimed at enhancing gaming through rigid regulations designed to protect its economic interest and comply with the law as well as to certify operators to protect so-called consumer-gamers. In Italy, there are currently two main categories of licenses (offline and online) in circulation, issued or awarded by the ADM in three series:

- | Series 1 first issued by legal decree in 1992, renewed in 2009 under the Abruzzo decree and are colloquially branded as "Monti" licenses that expired in 2016 and is currently due for renewal;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Finance Act decree of 2007 (FA7) series which were awarded by tender in 2006 and are colloquially branded as "Bersani" Licenses that expired in 2016 and is currently due for renewal; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | New series GAD (Gioco a Distanza) issued by application process under the Comunitaria decree in 2010 and expire in 2021.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Each series of license has a 10 year renewal term.
 
Monti and Bersani licenses provide both NS and PS offline (agencies and corners) as well as GAD online (web-based) distribution authorizations. Offline Monti licenses and Bersani licenses are subject to and expected to be consolidated under a new decree at renewal auction which is now due, while both the Monti and Bersani GAD licenses are expected to be consolidated under a renewal tender to match up with the limited number of Comunitaria Series GAD licenses expiring in 2021.
 
10


In 2011, Multigioco applied for a New Series GAD license under the regulatory changes requiring a tender notice process. The ADM granted Multigioco a new GAD license, and on July 4, 2012 gave the final authorization for Multigioco websites.
 
The ADM licenses provide Multigioco the right to:
 

- | offer only those gaming offerings that ADM authorizes for deployment in Italy (the “Territory”);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | enter into licensing, joint venture and acquisition agreements with shops and private enterprises as concessionaires that provide various local services such as convenience stores, bars, cafes, and restaurants in Italy;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | establish web cafe`s as permitted by the regulations enforced by the ADM regional office within the Territory; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | take such steps that are deemed necessary to develop the business of regulated gaming in the Territory.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our online license is subject to the laws of the Republic of Italy with an initial term expiring on June 15, 2021 and is renewable through the tender notice process.
 
Foreign Financial Considerations
 
Our gaming income is subject to income taxes based upon the laws of Italy which may also fluctuate if economic conditions in Italy remain uncertain.
 
For the Company’s financial reporting, our subsidiaries assets and liabilities, whose functional currency is the Euro, are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates. Income and expense items are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. The adjustments resulting from translating the Company's financial statements are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of Stockholders' Equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in net earnings based on differences between foreign exchange rates on the transaction date and settlement date. Fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates may have an adverse effect on our overall results.
Major Software Vendors
 
The following sets out a short list of various gaming software providers and a brief description:
 
Microgame S.p.A. provides a betting platforms to third-party operators in Italy and is a joint venture partner of Caesars Entertainment in the World Series of Poker.
 
Playtech Plc is a gaming software development company founded in 1999. The company provides software for online casinos, online poker rooms, online bingo games, online sports betting, scratch games, mobile gaming, live dealer games and fixed-odds arcade games online. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.
 
Amaya Inc. provides technology-based solutions, products, and services for global gaming and interactive entertainment industries worldwide. It operates through two segments, Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Business (B2B).
 
Competition
 
Overall competition in the online gaming industry is moderate with various sectors and operators competing for customers in various geographic markets. These include ‘land based’ online casinos, poker rooms, sports/race books, bingo, skill games, lottery, betting exchanges as well as internet or web only based operators. The global reach of the internet in concert with the plentiful supply of varying games means obstacles to switching venues for the consumer are virtually non-existent which increases competition. Differing regulations worldwide make it harder to expand and the easing of regulations in some markets have led to consolidation by monopoly entities which weakens competition while the opening of new markets allow for more operators to enter the marketplace to balance the competition somewhat.
 
11


We compete with a number of private and publicly traded companies that provide land-based and/or online gaming. In addition to known current competitors, traditional land based casino operators and other entities, many of which have significant financial resources, and occupy entrenched positions in the market and name-brand recognition, may provide Internet gaming services in the future, and thus become our competitors.
 
Particularly, our subsidiaries face direct competition in Italy from established online gaming sites like GTECH (Lottomatica), William Hill, 365sport, bwin, and many others. However, the Company has several advantages at its side, primarily local brand recognition, services that are tailored to calcio (soccer) enthusiasts. Most notably, Multigioco invests significant resources to calcio-focused marketing; fan engagement, live-streaming of calcio games; employ industry leading software; and is actively considering potential Italian celebrity partners.
 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry that create certain barriers to entry into the Italian market include but are not limited to: reputation, technology, financial stability and resources, proven track record of successful operations, critical mass and liquidity (particularly relating to online poker), regulatory compliance, independent oversight and transparency of business practices. While these barriers will limit those able to enter or compete effectively in the Italian market, it is also likely that new laws and regulations of governmental authority will be established in the future that will also offer barriers to new competitors.
 
Increased competition from current and future competitors may materially and adversely affect our business, revenues, operating results and financial condition.
