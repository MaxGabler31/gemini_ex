Item 1. BUSINESS
General
 Smith Micro develops software to simplify and enhance the mobile experience, providing solutions to leading wireless service providers, device manufacturers, and wireless users around the world. From optimizing wireless networks to uncovering customer experience insights, and from providing visual access to wireless voicemail to ensuring family safety, our solutions enrich connected lifestyles while creating new opportunities to engage consumers via smartphones. We also provide a services platform for the Internet of Things (“IoT”) that enables comprehensive device management and firmware over-the-air (“FOTA”) updates for various types of connected devices. In addition, Smith Micro’s portfolio includes a wide range of products for creating, sharing, and monetizing rich content, such as visual messaging and 2D/3D graphics applications. With this as a focus, it is Smith Micro’s mission to help our customers thrive in a connected world.
 For more than three decades, Smith Micro has developed deep expertise in embedded software for mobile devices, policy-based management platforms, and highly-scalable client and server applications. Tier 1 mobile network operators, cable providers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”)/device manufacturers, and enterprise businesses across a wide range of industries use our software to capitalize on the growth of connected consumers, mobile apps, vehicle telematics, and smart cities. 
 In general, we help our customers:
  
• | Provide valuable digital lifestyle services, such as family location services, parental controls, and device security, to mobile consumers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Manage mobile devices over-the-air for maximum performance, efficiency, reliability and cost-effectiveness;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide easy visual access to wirelessly delivered voicemail messages, while also providing easy conversion of voice messages to text messages;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimize wireless networks, reduce operational costs, and deliver “best-connected” user experiences;

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Design and create 2D and 3D digital illustrations, animation and figure design with easy-to-use, professional-grade graphics software.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We continue to innovate and evolve our business to take advantage of industry trends and opportunities in emerging markets, such as digital lifestyle services and online safety, “Big Data” analytics, automotive telematics, and the industrial IoT. The key to our longevity, however, is not simply technological innovation, but a never-ending focus on customer value.
 During fiscal year 2017, we made several important steps toward profitability. We completed a major restructuring of our business to bring expenses in-line with current revenues, decreasing expenses by approximately $3.5 million per quarter. Our new Chief Financial Officer, Timothy C. Huffmyer, brought an extensive background of financial planning and analysis, public-company experience in the technology sector, as well as mergers and acquisition experience to Smith Micro’s management team. Smith Micro ended 2017 on a strong note with the launch of its flagship product, SafePath® Family, with Sprint, the first Tier 1, U.S.-based mobile network operator (“MNO”) to roll out the service.
 In addition to these milestones, we also closed two private funding rounds in fiscal year 2017. These stock-based transactions helped the Company to reduce debt, increase stockholder equity, and increase funds available for working capital purposes. 
 The Company was incorporated in California in November 1983, and reincorporated in Delaware in June 1995. Our principal executive offices are located at 51 Columbia, Aliso Viejo, California 92656. Our telephone number is (949) 362-5800. Our website address is www.smithmicro.com, and we make our filings with the U.S. Securities and

 Business Segments
 Our business is focused on two industry segments: Wireless and Graphics. We do not separately allocate operating expenses, nor do we allocate specific assets to these segments. Therefore, segment information reported includes only revenues. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information related to our business segments and geographical information.
Wireless Segment
 The wireless industry continues to undergo rapid change on all fronts, from the ubiquity of Wi-Fi and cellular networks, to the vast array of connected devices, mobile applications, and digital content consumed by users who want information, high-speed wireless connectivity, and entertainment anytime, anywhere. While most of us think about being “connected” in terms of computers, tablets and smartphones, the IoT is creating a world where almost anything can be connected to the wireless internet. Wearable devices such as smartwatches, fitness trackers and GPS locators are now commonplace, enabling people and pets to be connected to the “Internet of Everything” as well. These devices have created an entire ecosystem of over-the-top (“OTT”) apps, while expanding how communication service providers can provide value to mobile consumers.
 In addition, pervasive connectivity has changed the way businesses operate on small and grand scales.  For example, Wi-Fi hotspots are being deployed by neighborhood bookstores and coffee houses to keep customers on premise longer, as well as by large sports arenas to deliver real-time video feeds via social networks and online broadcasts.  Retailers are now spending more than 50% of their advertising budgets on mobile media, and targeting for those advertisements is driven by “Big Data” initiatives that collect consumer information from virtually every online or mobile interaction.
 Although there are numerous business opportunities associated with pervasive connectivity, there are also many challenges, including:
  
• | The average age by which most children use smartphones and other connected devices continues to decrease. As such, parents and guardians must be proactive in managing and combating digital lifestyle problems such as excess screen time, cyberbullying, and online safety;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Complexity, congestion, and spectrum scarcity plague wireless networks, making it difficult and expensive to satisfy the demand for mobile services by consumers and businesses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As IoT use cases continue to proliferate and scale, management complexity, security and interoperability must be addressed efficiently and correctly;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MNOs are being marginalized by messaging applications, and face growing competitive pressure from cable/multiple service operators (“MSO”) and others deploying Wi-Fi networks to attract mobile users;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enterprises face increasing pressure to mobilize workforces, operations, and customer engagement, but lack the expertise and technologies needed to leverage mobile securely and cost-effectively;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumers, frustrated by slow, congested mobile networks and inconsistent device/app behavior, seek simpler network access and more personalized mobile experiences, while simultaneously demanding faster, cheaper, and more secure wireless services.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Graphics Segment
 Smith Micro’s graphics group develops a variety of software, including graphic design and animation, and compression and PC/Mac utilities, for consumers, professional artists, and educators. These products are available through direct sales on Smith Micro websites (smithmicro.com, mysmithmicro.com and contentparadise.com), as well as through affiliate websites, resellers, and retail outlets.
 The Company’s graphics portfolio includes Poser®, a professional solution for 3D Figure Design and Animation; Moho® (formerly Anime Studio®), a complete solution for 2D animation; and MotionArtist®, an easy-to-use tool that enables amateur and professional artists to bring comics to life with animated panels, text and word balloons.

Our reseller agreement with Japanese software developer Celsys, which permitted us to market, license and provide support for the English-language version of Clip Studio® Paint (formerly Manga Studio), terminated in the fourth quarter of 2017. As such, Clip Studio Paint was phased out of our product portfolio in 2017.

Key Revenue Contributors
 Revenues attributable to Sprint and their respective affiliates in the Wireless business segment accounted for 61%, 63%, and 65% of the Company’s total revenues for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Revenues attributable to FastSpring in the Graphics business segment accounted for 14%, 14%, and 11% of the Company’s total revenues for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The loss of any of our major customers or decisions by a significant customer to substantially reduce purchases from us for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Customer Service and Technical Support
 We provide technical support and customer service through our online knowledge base, email, and live chat. OEM customers generally provide their own primary customer support functions and rely on us for support to their technical support personnel.
Product Development
 The software industry, particularly the wireless market, is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in technology and user needs. We work closely with industry groups and customers, both current and potential, to help us anticipate changes in technology and determine future customer needs. Software functionality depends upon the capabilities of the hardware. Accordingly, we maintain engineering relationships with various hardware manufacturers and we develop our software in tandem with their product development. Our engineering relationships with manufacturers, as well as with our major customers, are central to our product development efforts. We remain focused on the development and expansion of our technology, particularly in the wireless space. Research and development expenditures amounted to $9.0 million, $15.9 million, and $13.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Manufacturing
 We utilize manufacturing capabilities for our Graphics physical products. Our product development group produces a product master for each product that is then duplicated and packaged into products by the manufacturing organization. All product components are purchased by our personnel in our Aliso Viejo, California facility. Our manufacturing is subcontracted to outside vendors and includes the replication of CD-ROMs and the printing of documentation materials. Assembly of the final package is completed by our Aliso Viejo, California facility.
Competition
 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. These conditions create new opportunities for Smith Micro, as well as for our competitors, and we expect new competitors to continue to enter the market. We not only compete with other software vendors for new customer contracts, we also compete to acquire technology and qualified personnel.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the mobile software market include domain expertise, product features, usability, quality, price, customer service, and effective sales and marketing efforts. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors, there can be no assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. We also believe that the market for our software products has been and will continue to be characterized by significant price competition. A material reduction in the price we obtain for our products would negatively affect our profitability.

Many of our existing and potential customers have the resources to develop products that compete directly with our products. As such, these customers may opt to discontinue the purchase of our products in the future. With this as background, our future performance is substantially dependent upon the extent to which existing customers elect to purchase software from us rather than designing and developing their own software.
 Proprietary Rights and Licenses
 
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, foreign intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. We have United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. We will continue to apply for such protections in the future as we deem necessary to protect our intellectual property. We seek to avoid unauthorized use and disclosure of our proprietary intellectual property by requiring employees and third parties with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code.
 
Our wireless customers license our products through software license agreements or access our offerings through software as a service (“SaaS”) agreements, and our graphics products are subject to “click-through” end user license agreements. Our license agreements contain restrictions on reverse engineering, duplication, disclosure, and transfer, and our SaaS agreements contain restrictions on access and use.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or take effective steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 161 employees within the following departments: 103 in engineering, 28 in sales and marketing, 12 in operations and customer support, and 18 in management and administration. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relationships with our employees are good.
