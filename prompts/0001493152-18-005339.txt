ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
 
History of the Business
 
We were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 25, 2008 under the name Loran Connection Corp. We were formed to provide a variety of services in the area of individual and group tourism and business support in Ukraine. We subsequently filed a resale registration statement with the SEC on May 28, 2009, which was declared effective on October 28, 2009. On January 25, 2012, we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation to, among other things, change our name to “PetroTerra Corp.” and effect a thirty-two-for-one reverse split. We changed our name to reflect a proposed change in our business operations. On October 2, 2013, in connection with a change of control in the management of the Company, the Company began business operations in the oil and gas sector. On December 18, 2013, we filed a certificate of change to effect a one-for-two reverse stock split of our authorized and our outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock. On July 1, 2015, we filed a certificate of change to effect a one-for-two and one half reverse stock split of our authorized and our outstanding shares of common stock. Since January 2016, as a result of the decline in the oil and gas markets, we generated minimal sales revenue and our operations were subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise.
 
On November 22, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effect a reverse stock split of its outstanding and authorized shares of common stock at a ratio of 1 for 30 (the “Reverse Stock Split”). Upon the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock was to be decreased from approximately 28,323,588 to 944,120 shares, all with a par value of $0.001. However, although it was filed with and processed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the prior management of the Company did not follow through and obtain ultimate approval of the Reverse Stock Split by FINRA. Therefore, the Reverse Stock Split never became effective.
 
Reverse Merger
 
On March 30, 2017 (the “Closing Date”), our company and Save on Transport entered into a Share Exchange Agreement dated as of the same date (the “Share Exchange Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, Save on Transport became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours on the Closing Date (the “Reverse Merger”). In the Reverse Merger, we purchased all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Save on Transport from Steven Yariv, and in exchange, we issued 114,202,944 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), to Steven Yariv, and Steven Yariv was appointed Chief Executive Officer and elected as the Chairman of our Board of Directors.
 
As a result of the Reverse Merger, we are the holding company for our wholly-owned subsidiary, Save on Transport. Save on Transport was formed under the laws of the state of Florida in July 2016. Save on Transport operates as an automobile shipping company that provides transportation, brokerage, and logistics services relating to vehicle shipping.
 
In connection with the Reverse Merger, Steven Yariv was appointed Chief Executive Officer and elected as the Chairman of our Board of Directors.
 
Our principal executive offices are located in the United States at 2833 Exchange Court, West Palm Beach, Florida 33409, and our telephone number is (561) 801-9188.

Our Current Business Plan
 
Save on Transport is a Florida based non-asset provider of integrated transportation management solutions. We provide brokerage and logistics services such as transportation scheduling, routing and other value added services related to the transportation of automobiles and other freight, which involve the use of independent contractor-owned trucks and equipment. We do not own the trucks or other equipment used to transport freight. Instead we utilize our relationships with subcontracted transportation providers – typically independent contract motor carriers. However, we utilize carrier services of an affiliate entity for transportation services within Florida. We make a profit on the difference between what we charge our customers for the services we provide and what we pay to the transportation providers to transport our customers’ freight. Our success depends in large part on our ability to hire and train talented salespeople and deploy them under exceptional leaders, develop sophisticated information technology, and build relationships with the carriers in our network so that we can purchase the optimal transportation solutions for our customers. Currently, all of our revenues are derived from domestic shipments.
Our Strategy and Competitive Strengths
 
Our growth strategy focuses on developing a full suite of automobile transportation brokerage and logistics solutions for our customers. Our service offerings consist of non-asset based transportation supply chain management, logistics and brokerage solutions. We facilitate cost-effective vehicle shipping for customers for a variety of reasons including:

● | Household moves; 
--+-----------------------------------------
● | Seasonal moves; 
● | Military moves; 
● | College moves; 
● | Company relocation; 
● | Internet automobile purchases; 
● | Classic car and collector shows; and 
● | Transportation for car dealerships. 



Save on Transport differentiates itself from the competition and grows its business by sustaining a high level of customer service, offering expedited and time-definite services, while providing competitive pricing.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies in the United States. Such regulations impact us directly and indirectly by regulating third-party transportation providers we use to transport freight for our customers.
Regulation affecting Motor Carriers, Owner Operators and Transportation Brokers.
 
In the United States, our third-party providers that operate as motor carriers have licenses to operate as motor carriers from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). The third-party motor carriers we engage in the United States must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug- and alcohol-testing, hours-of-service, records retention, vehicle inspection, driver qualification and minimum insurance requirements. Weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to government regulations. Other agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Food and Drug Administration, the California Air Resources Board, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), also regulate our third-party motor carriers and independent contractor drivers. The third-party carriers we use are also subject to a variety of vehicle registration and licensing requirements of the state or other local jurisdictions in which they operate.

In 2010, the FMCSA introduced the Compliance Safety Accountability program (“CSA”), which uses a Safety Management System (“SMS”) to rank motor carriers on seven categories of safety-related data, known as Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories, or “BASICs,” which data, it is anticipated, will eventually be used for determining a carrier’s DOT safety rating under revisions to existing Safety Fitness Determination (“SFD”) regulations. In December 2015, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (“FAST Act”) was signed into law, which requires the FMCSA to review the CSA program to ensure that it provides the most reliable analysis possible. During this review period, the FAST Act requires the FMCSA to remove a property carrier’s CSA scores from public view. The FMCSA has since announced an SFD Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) that would revamp the current three-tier federal rating system for federally regulated commercial motor carriers.
 
Although the CSA scores are not currently publicly available, this development is likely to be temporary. As a result, once the program has been revamped, our network of third-party transportation providers may could be ranked poorly as compared to competitors, and the safety ratings of their motor carrier operations could be adversely impacted. A reduction in safety and fitness ratings may result in difficulty attracting and retaining qualified independent contractors and could cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with more favorable CSA scores, which would adversely affect our results of operations.
 
Classification of Independent Contractors.
 
Tax and other federal and state regulatory authorities as well as private litigants continue to assert that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. Federal legislators have introduced legislation in the past to make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements for employers of independent contractors and to heighten the penalties of employers who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees’ overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice. Federal legislators also sought to expand the Fair Labor Standards Act to cover “non-employees” who perform labor or services for businesses, even if the “non-employees” are properly classified as independent contractors; require taxpayers to provide written notice to workers based upon their classification as either an “employee” or a “non-employee”; and impose penalties and fines for violations of the notice requirements or “employee” or “non-employee” misclassifications. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers’ compensation and income taxes, and a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with this initiative. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. If our independent contractor drivers are determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under some or all of the following: federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.
Other Regulations.
 
We are subject to a variety of other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption statutes. Further, the transportation industry is subject to possible other regulatory and legislative changes (such as the possibility of more stringent environmental, climate change and/or safety/security regulations) that may affect the economics of the freight shipping industry by requiring changes in operating practices or changing the demand for motor carrier services or the cost of providing transportation logistics services.

Employees
 
As of the date of this filing, Save on Transport has seven (7) full-time employees. PetroTerra Corp. has no full-time employees.
 
Marketing and Significant Customers
 
Our customers are primarily different and distinct individuals and dealerships introduced through referral sources. Our business serves the North American market, with a total concentration in the United States.
 
To best serve our customers, we will need to hire and maintain a significant staff of sales representatives and related support personnel. Our sales strategy is twofold: we seek to establish long-term relationships with new accounts and to increase the amount of business generated from our existing customer base. We believe that these attributes are competitive advantages in the transportation and logistics industry.
 
Information Systems
 
We utilize two main cloud based information systems: jTracker for taking customer orders and Central Dispatch for posting orders for carrier communications.
 
Competition
 
The transportation and logistics industry is highly competitive, with thousands of companies competing in the domestic and international markets. Our competitors include local, regional, national and international companies with the same services that our business provides. Due in part to the fragmented nature of the industry, our business units must strive daily to retain existing business relationships and forge new relationships.
 
We compete on service, reliability and price. Some competitors have larger customer bases, significantly more resources and more experience than we do. The health of the transportation and logistics industry will continue to be a function of domestic and global economic growth.
 
Seasonality
 
Generally, our revenues do not exhibit a significant seasonal pattern; however, revenue is affected by adverse weather conditions, holidays and the number of business days that occur during a given period because revenue is directly related to the available work days of our third party shipping providers.
Properties
 
Our principal executive offices are located in the United States at 2833 Exchange Court, Suite A, West Palm Beach, Florida 33409, comprised of 400 square feet of office space. The company executed a sublease agreement with an affiliate for office space for a one-year term. The sublease commenced on August 1, 2016 at a rate of $300 a month. The sublease was extended on August 1, 2017 and terminated on December 14, 2017, at which point the Company signed a new one-year term lease with the third-party landlord directly for the entire space previously occupied by the affiliate. The monthly rent under the renewed lease is $1,600 plus maintenance charges and taxes.
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. We are not currently a party to any legal proceeding that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.
 
How to Obtain our SEC Filings
 
We file annual, quarterly, and special reports, proxy statements, and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Reports, proxy statements and other information filed with the SEC can be inspected and copied at the public reference facilities of the SEC at 100 F Street N.E., Washington, DC 20549. Such material may also be accessed electronically by means of the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of:
 PetroTerra Corp.
 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PetroTerra Corp. and Subsidiary (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017 and for the period from July 12, 2016 (inception) to December 31, 2016 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017 and for the period from July 12, 2016 (inception) to December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Going Concern
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has a net loss and cash used in operations of $744,805 and $152,185 respectively in 2017 and has a working capital deficit, accumulated deficit and stockholders’ deficit of $775,137, $744,779 and $775,137, respectively at December 31, 2017. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s Plan in regards to these matters is also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
 
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
 
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The transaction is being accounted for as a reverse merger between a private company and an inactive public company in which Save On, the private company, is considered to be the acquirer of Petroterra Corp. since the sole shareholder of Save On obtained approximately 80% voting control and management and board control. Accordingly, the reverse merger is accounted for as a recapitalization of Save On in which the assets and liabilities of both companies, on the transaction date, are recorded at their historical book values, the equity of Save On is retroactively restated to give effect to the exchange of the Save On shares for Petroterra Corp. shares, the historical activity of the combined entity is that of Save On and the activity of Petroterra Corp. is recorded only from the date of the transaction.
 
Note 2 – Going Concern
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company is in an early stage and the net loss and cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $744,805 and $152,185, respectively. The company had a working capital deficit, accumulated deficit and stockholders’ deficit of $775,137, $744,779, and $775,137 as of December 31, 2017, respectively, and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. It is management’s opinion that these matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance date of this report. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon increasing revenues both organically, with increased marketing efforts, and potential acquisition targets, which would be accretive to the Company. Additional capital may be required for the Company to meet its revenue growth plans. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recovery of recorded assets or classification of liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Note 3 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

PETROTERRA CORP.
 Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements
 December 31, 2017 and 2016
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of Petroterra Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Save On. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with US-GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates and periodically adjusts its estimates and assumptions, based on historical experience, the impact of the current economic environment, and other key factors. Volatile energy markets, as well as changes in consumer spending have increased the inherent uncertainty in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Significant estimates included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes include the valuation of accounts receivable, valuation of intangible assets, the valuation of derivative instruments and valuation of deferred tax assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not have any cash equivalents. The Company’s cash balance does not exceed federal insured limits.
Accounts Receivable
 
Accounts receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms. The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessment of past due balances and economic conditions. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible. Management identifies a delinquent customer based upon the delinquent payment status of an outstanding invoice, generally greater than 30 days past due date. The delinquent account designation does not trigger an accounting transaction until such time the account is deemed uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by examining the reserve history and any outstanding invoices that are over 30 days past due as of the end of the reporting period. Accounts are deemed uncollectible on a case-by-case basis, at management’s discretion based upon an examination of the communication with the delinquent customer and payment history. Typically, accounts are only escalated to “uncollectible” status after multiple attempts at collection have proven unsuccessful.
Revenue Recognition and Cost of Revenue
 
The Company recognizes operating revenues and the related direct costs of such revenue which includes carrier fees and dispatch costs as of the date the freight is delivered by the carrier. Customer payments received prior to delivery are recorded as a deferred revenue liability and related carrier fees if paid prior to delivery are recorded as a deferred expense asset. In accordance with ASC Topic 605-45, Principal Agent Considerations, the Company recognizes revenue on a gross basis.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are minimal due to the collection history and due to the nature of the Company’s client base. The Company limits its credit risk with respect to cash by maintaining cash balances with high-quality financial institutions. At times, the Company’s cash may exceed U.S. Federally insured limits, and as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not have cash and cash equivalents on deposit that exceeded the federally insured limit.
Advertising
 
The Company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expenses as incurred. The Company incurred $109,667 and $0 in advertising costs during the year ended December 31, 2017 and for the period from July 12, 2016 (inception) to December 31, 2016, respectively.

PETROTERRA CORP.
 Notes To The Consolidated Financial Statements
 December 31, 2017 and 2016
 
Intangible Assets
 
The Company’s intangible assets are recorded at cost and amortized over the expected useful life.
 
In November 2017 the Company acquired a Motor Carrier number (MC) and a Department of Transportation number (DOT) from a third party for $36,500. The Company reviews its intangible assets for impairment annually and determined that the carrying value was not recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. An impairment was recorded for the entire amount as of December 31, 2017.
 
Long-Lived Assets
 
Our company reviews its property and equipment and any identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The test for impairment is required to be performed by management at least annually. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted operating cash flow expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
 
Income Taxes
 
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as well as differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
 
The Company does not recognize a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions unless it concludes that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, the Company recognizes a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in the management’s judgment, is greater than 50% likely to be realized. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in “Income tax expense” in the income statement.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments
 
The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported as charges or credits to income.
 
For option-based simple derivative financial instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Upon conversion of a note where the embedded conversion option has been bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative liability, the Company records the shares at fair value, relieves all related notes, derivatives and debt discounts and recognizes a net gain or loss on debt extinguishment.
 

F-8
---

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s promissory note obligations approximate fair value, as the terms of these notes are consistent with terms available in the market for instruments with similar risk.
 
We account for our derivative financial instruments, consisting of certain conversion options embedded in our convertible instruments, at fair value using level 3 inputs. We determine the fair value of these derivative liabilities using the Black-Scholes option pricing model when appropriate, and in certain circumstances using binomial lattice models or other accepted valuation practices.
 
When determining the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, we are required to use various estimates and unobservable inputs, including, among other things, expected terms of the instruments, expected volatility of our stock price, expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate. Changes in any of the assumptions related to the unobservable inputs identified above may change the fair value of the instrument. Increases in expected term, anticipated volatility and expected dividends generally result in increases in fair value, while decreases in the unobservable inputs generally result in decreases in fair value.
 
Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share
 
The Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC-260, “Earnings per Share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential shares of common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive. Dilutive securities as of December 31, 2017 include convertible notes which were convertible into approximately 84,835,079 common shares as of December 31, 2017 and Series A convertible preferred stock which were convertible into 51,380,552 common shares as of December 31, 2017.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, which supersedes existing accounting standards for revenue recognition and creates a single framework. Additional updates to Topic 606 issued by the FASB in 2015 and 2016 include the following:
 
● ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of the new guidance such that the new provisions will now be required for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
 
● ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations, which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations (reporting revenue gross versus net).
 
● ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which clarifies the implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations and classifying licensing arrangements.
 
● ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which clarifies the implementation guidance in a number of other areas.
 
The underlying principle is to use a five-step analysis of transactions to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The standard permits the use of either a retrospective or modified retrospective application. ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-12 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method for annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2018. The Company has aggregated and reviewed its contracts that are within the scope of ASC 606. Based on its evaluation, the Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASC 606 will have a material impact on its balance sheet or related consolidated statements of earnings, equity or cash flows. Accordingly, the Company will continue to recognize revenue at the time services are delivered.
 
In July 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480); Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, (Part II) Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception. For public business entities, the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. For all other entities, the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The amendments in Part II of this Update do not require any transition guidance because those amendments do not have an accounting effect. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
 
There are currently no other accounting standards that have been issued but not yet adopted that we believe will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption.

Note 7 – Convertible Promissory Notes Payable
 
Convertible promissory notes at December 31, 2017 are as follows:
 

 | 2017 | 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------+--------
Red Diamond Partners, LLC, net of derivative debt discount of $118,370 | $ | 151,630
RDW Capital, LLC., net of original issuance discount of $104,137 and derivative debt discount of $14,877 | | 120,986
Convertible promissory notes payable, net | $ | 272,616

 
We evaluated the convertible promissory notes transactions in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and determined that the conversion feature of the convertible promissory notes were not afforded the exemption for conventional convertible instruments due to their respective variable conversion rate and price protection provision. The Company recorded a derivative liability which is adjusted at each reporting period to its fair value (See Note 9).
 
RDW Capital, LLC.
 
On March 30, 2017, we assumed a convertible note payable to RDW Capital, LLC which was dated February 16, 2017. The $4,000 note payable bears interest at 12% per annum. The note matures on August 16, 2017 and is secured by the share reservation of 300% of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon a conversion. The note is convertible into shares of common stock at a price equal to a variable conversion price of fifty percent (50%) of the volume-weighted averages for the ten (10) days preceding the date of conversion and contains price protection on the conversion rate. On August 10, 2017, the principal of $4,000, accrued interest of $225 and prepayment fees of $634 were paid.
 
On March 30, 2017, we assumed a convertible note payable to RDW Capital, LLC which was dated March 15, 2017. The $2,464 note payable bears interest at 12% per annum. The note matures on September 15, 2017 and is secured by the share reservation of 300% of the number of shares of common stock issuable upon a conversion. The note is convertible into shares of common stock at a price equal to a variable conversion price of fifty percent (50%) of the volume-weighted averages for the ten (10) days preceding the date of conversion and contains price protection on the conversion rate. On August 10, 2017, the principal of $2,464, accrued interest of $116 and prepayment fees of $387 were paid.
 
The payoffs of the above two convertible notes resulted in a gain on debt extinguishment of $10,169 related to the two bifurcated derivatives. The prepayment fees of $1,021 were included as interest expense.

Red Diamond Partners LLC
 
On April 25, 2017, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with RedDiamond Partners LLC (“RedDiamond”) pursuant to which the Company would issue to RedDiamond Convertible Promissory Notes in an aggregate principal amount of up to $355,000, which includes a purchase price of $350,000 and transaction costs of $5,000. On April 25, 2017, the Company received the initial Tranche of $95,000, which is a loan amount of $100,000, net of the $5,000 fee, recorded as convertible note payable. The initial Tranche matures on April 25, 2018 and each tranche will mature 1 year after the date of such funding. The second Tranche was received on June 2, 2017 for $85,000 and the third Tranche for $85,000 was received on August 8, 2017 upon filing of the Registration Statement. The fourth Tranche will be for $85,000 and was to occur ninety (90) days after the First Closing, however, as of the date of this filing, the fourth tranche has not yet been received. The Purchaser shall not be required to fund any Tranche subsequent to the first Tranche if there is an event of default as described in the promissory notes. The RedDiamond Notes bear interest at a rate of 12% per annum and are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at RedDiamond’s option at 65% of the lowest VWAP for the previous ten trading days preceding the conversion.
 
In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Promissory Note above, the Company determined that the terms of the Convertible Promissory Note included a down-round provision under which the conversion price could be affected by future equity offerings undertaken by the Company.
 
Accordingly, under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic No. 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in an Entity’s Own Stock”, the embedded conversion option contained in the convertible instruments were accounted for as derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and shall be adjusted to fair value through earnings at each reporting date. The fair value of the embedded conversion option derivatives were determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. On the initial measurement dates of tranches received prior to December 31, 2017, the fair value of the embedded conversion option derivatives of $376,841 was recorded as derivative liabilities and was allocated as a debt discount up to the net proceeds of the Convertible Promissory Notes of $265,000 with the remainder of $111,841 charged as initial derivative expense.
 
On the three initial measurement dates, the fair value of the derivative liabilities was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following assumptions: dividend rate 0%, expected term 1.0 year, expected volatility ranging from 319% to 526%, risk-free interest rate ranging from 1.09% to 1.24%.
 
The balance of the note payable as of December 31, 2017 amounted to $151,630 comprised of principal balance of $270,000, net of debt discount relating to the bifurcated derivative of $118,370.

RDW Capital, LLC.
 
On June 30, 2017, the Company issued RDW Capital, LLC a senior convertible note in the aggregate principal amount of $240,000, for an aggregate purchase price of $30,000 of which $15,000 had been recorded as advance from lender as of March 31, 2017 and the remaining $15,000 received on June 30, 2017. The principal due under the Note accrues interest at a rate of 12% per annum. All principal and accrued interest under the Note is due six months following the issue date of the Note, and is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, at a conversion price equal to fifty (50%) of the lowest volume-weighted average price for the previous ten trading days immediately preceding the conversion. The Note includes anti-dilution protection, including a down-round provision under which the conversion price could be affected by future equity offerings undertaken by the Company, as well as customary events of default, including non-payment of the principal or accrued interest due on the Note. Upon an event of default, all obligations under the Note will become immediately due and payable and the Company will be required to make certain payments to the Lender.
 
Accordingly, under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic No. 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in an Entity’s Own Stock”, the embedded conversion option contained in the convertible instruments were accounted for as derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and shall be adjusted to fair value through earnings at each reporting date. The fair value of the embedded conversion option derivatives were determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. On the initial measurement date, the fair value of the embedded conversion option derivatives of $527,477 was recorded as derivative liabilities and was allocated as a debt discount up to the net proceeds of the Convertible Promissory Notes of $30,000 with the remainder of $497,477 charged as initial derivative expense.
 
On June 30, 2017, initial measurement date, the fair value of the derivative liabilities was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following assumptions: dividend rate 0%, expected term 1.0 year, expected volatility of 404%, risk-free interest rate of 1.24%.
 
The balance as of December 31, 2017 amounted to $120,986, comprised of principal balance of $240,000, and net of Original Issue Discount (OID) of $104,137 and debt discount relating to the bifurcated derivative of $14,877.
 
On December 31, 2017 the Company failed to make its required maturity date payment of principal and interest.  In accordance with the note, the Company entered into default on January 3, 2018 which increased the interest rate to 2% per month.  As of the date of this report the lender has not exercised any of its remedies provided for in the note.  One of the remedies the lender may request is an immediate repayment of the loan at 125% of the principal balance, which would result in the recording of $60,000 penalty expense and the related liability.  
 
Note 8 – Commitments and Contingencies
 
Related Party – Lease
 
The Company executed a sublease agreement with an affiliate for office space for a one-year term. The sublease commenced on August 1, 2016 at a rate of $300 per month. The sublease was extended on August 1, 2017 and terminated on December 14, 2017, at which point the Company signed a new one-year term lease with the third-party landlord directly for the entire space previously occupied by the affiliate. The monthly rent under the renewed lease is $1,600 plus maintenance charges and taxes.
 
Common stock ownership
 
As a result of the Company’s non-effectiveness of the 1 for 30 reverse stock-split, which was previously represented to have been effective prior to the March 30, 2017 reverse merger, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer’s post reverse merger common stock ownership percentage has been reduced from approximately 99% to approximately 80%. The Company and the Chief Executive Officer are exploring remedies, which may include capital stock or other consideration, to correct this situation.
 
Other
 
From time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operation in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2017, there were no pending or threatened lawsuits that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on results of our operations.

Note 9– Stockholders’ Equity
 
Preferred
 
The preferred stock is designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. Each share of preferred stock has a par value of $.001 and a stated value of $1.00. Dividends are payable at the rate per share of 7% per annum cumulative based on the stated value. The Series A preferred shares have no voting rights, except as required by law. Each share of preferred stock is convertible based on the stated value at a conversion price of $.0833 at the option of the holder; provided, however, if a triggering event occurs, as defined in the document, the conversion price shall thereafter be reduced, and only reduced, to equal forty percent of the lowest VWAP during the thirty consecutive trading day period prior to the conversion date. The beneficial ownership limitation attached to conversion is 4.99%, which can be decreased or increased, upon not less than 61 days notice to the Company, but in no event exceeding 19.99% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of common stock upon conversion of the preferred stock. After 36 months the Company has the right to redeem all, but not less than all, of the outstanding preferred shares in cash at a price equal to 130% of the stated value plus any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon. Undeclared cumulative preferred stock dividends were approximately $280,000 as of December 31, 2017.
Recapitalization
 
On March 30, 2017, the Company closed the Share Exchange Agreement between Save-On and Petroterra Corp. and is deemed to have issued 4,000,000 Series A convertible preferred shares and 28,323,588 common shares to the original shareholders of Petroterra Corp. The Company acquired assets of $10,000 and assumed liabilities of $48,458.

NOTE 10 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
Disclosures about fair value of financial instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value information, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, where it is practicable to estimate that value. As of December 31, 2017, the amounts reported for cash, accrued interest and other expenses, notes payables, and derivative liability approximate the fair value because of their short maturities.
 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). These tiers include:
 

● | Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and 
● | Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 

 
We measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows at December 31, 2017:
 

 | Total | | (Level 1) | | | (Level 2) | | (Level 3) 
---------------------------------------------+-------+---+---------------+---+---+---------------+---+--------------

Total liabilities measured at fair value | $ | - | | $ | - | | $ | - | $ | 601,615

 
The following is a reconciliation of the derivative liability for which Level 3 inputs were used in determining the approximate fair value:

Note 11– Related Party Transactions
 
The Company executed a sublease agreement with an affiliate for office space for a one-year term. The sublease commenced on August 1, 2016 at a rate of $300 per month. The sublease was extended on August 1, 2017 and terminated on December 14, 2017, at which point the Company signed a new one-year term lease with the third party landlord directly for the entire space previously occupied by the affiliate. Rent expense to the affiliate was $3,300 in the year ended December 31, 2017 and $1,500 from July 12, 2016 (inception) through December 31, 2016.
 
The Company utilized the affiliate as one of the carriers, providing auto transportation, in the normal course of business. The carrier fees incurred to the affiliate were $13,350 for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
During 2017 certain revenue and related costs initially recorded by the Company were deemed as affiliate revenue and related costs and were therefore reversed. This was caused by either customers who had not yet approved the Company as a vendor or remittances which were made to the affiliate directly. Such remittances were then remitted from the affiliate back to the Company. The outcome resulted in a net due to affiliate of $23,551 as of December 31, 2017.
 
The Company utilized various ancillary services of the affiliate including software and certain technology without any charge by the affiliate.
 
The Company also utilized certain employees of the affiliate in 2017 without any charge by the affiliate. As a result the Company did not incur any labor charges for the period January 1, 2017 through December 15, 2017, except the salary of the Chief Executive Officer.

A reconciliation of the statutory US Federal income tax rate to the company’s effective income tax rate is as follows:
 

 | December 31, 2017 | | | December 31, 2016 
------------------------------+-----------------------+--------+----+----------------------
Federal tax | | 34.00 | % | | -
State tax | | 3.65 | % | | 
Permanent items | | (31.55 | )% | |

On December 22, 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was signed into law. Pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin No 118, a reasonable estimate of the specific income tax effects for the TCJA can be determined and the Company is reporting these provisional amounts. Accordingly, the company may revise these estimates in the upcoming year.
 
The TCJA reduces the corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. All deferred income tax assets and liabilities, including NOL’s have been measured using the new rate under the TCJA and are reflected in the valuation of these assets as of December 31, 2017.
 
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between amounts recorded for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for tax purposes. The major components of deferred tax assets are net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $30,600.
 
At December 31, 2017 a net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward for federal income tax purposes is $120,600. The Federal NOL’s will begin to expire in 2037.
 
The tax years ended December 31, 2014 through 2017 are considered to be open under statute and therefore may be subject to examination by the IRS.
