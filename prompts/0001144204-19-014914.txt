ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Bio-En Holdings Corp. (formerly Olivia Inc.) is a Delaware corporation, incorporated on August 2, 2011. The Company initially intended to participate in the bio-fuel technology industry. The Company held a license agreement for a portfolio of patents including Gravity Pressure Vessels and supporting appurtenances (“Licensed Technology”).


The Company planned to design and execute agreements to build, operate and maintain a bio-mass to energy facility on the Island of Malta, utilizing the Licensed Technology (“Facility”). 
 
The Company was not successful in obtaining the full funding required to establish the Facility. The Company is no longer seeking to exploit the Licensed Technology and/or pursuing the establishment of the Facility.
 
As a result of discontinuing its prior operations relating to the proposed building of the Facility and exploitation of the Licensed Technology, the Company became a shell company. As discussed below, the Company’s current business plan is to seek and identify a privately-held operating company desiring to become a publicly held company by combining with the Company through a reverse merger or acquisition type transaction. Private companies wishing to have their securities publicly traded may seek to merge or effect an exchange transaction with a shell company that is reporting and eligible for quotation on the over-the-counter market. As a result of the merger or exchange transaction, the stockholders of the private company will hold a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the shell company. Typically, the directors and officers of the private company become the directors and officers of the shell company. Often the name of the private company becomes the name of the shell company.
 
Although the Company has not yet determined what private company, business or assets to acquire, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer is involved in several business ventures and may ask the board to consider acquiring one or more of such business ventures. Alternatively, the Company may seek to acquire a private company, business or assets from an unrelated third party.
 

Our Corporate History and Background 
 
The Company, through its merger (“Merger”) with Bio-En Corp (“BEC”), entered into the development stage and devoted substantially all of its efforts to the development of its business plan, whereby Company intended to participate in the waste to bio-fuel technology industry. The Company intended to plan, design, and execute agreements to build, operate and maintain a bio-mass to energy operation at the Facility, the same contingent on sufficient capital funding. The Company’s fiscal year-end is December 31.

New Opportunities
 
With the inability to raise the necessary funds we have been forced to reevaluate our business plans. As such, our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through starting up a new business or a combination with an existing business. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. Furthermore, we will consider both businesses and opportunities that are under the control of our chief executive officer, Baruch Adika, and also businesses and opportunities that are under the control of unrelated third parties.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities has and will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our officers and directors. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In our efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider the following kinds of factors:
 

· | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by us or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The cost of participation by us as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other relevant factors.
--+------------------------

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, we will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.

Form of Acquisition
 
The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of us and the potential candidates, and our relative negotiating strength with such candidates. It is likely that we will require its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of our common stock or other securities. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called "tax free" reorganization under Section 368(a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business will own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other "tax free" provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would, in such circumstances, retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were our stockholders prior to such transaction.
 
Our present stockholders may not be left with control of a majority of our voting shares following the formation of a new business or an acquisition. As part of such a transaction, all or a majority of our directors and officers may resign and new directors may be appointed.
 
In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon determination of the Company’s Board of Directors (“Board”), without any vote or approval by stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving us, it may be necessary to call a stockholders' meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, we will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision were made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to us of the related costs incurred.
 
Our chief executive officer, Baruch Adika, is involved in several different business ventures and may propose to the Company that it acquire the assets or entities that own one or more of these ventures although no such proposal has been made and Mr. Adika may determine not to make any such proposal and, instead we may seek to acquire a private company, assets or business from an unrelated third party. Other than as discussed above, none of our officers or our directors have yet had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may affect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.
 
We anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital that we will have and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of being a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.
 
Employees
 
We presently have no employees apart from our management.  We have several consultants who currently provide services to us. Some of them are compensated for their services through the issuance of Company shares, which may result in further dilution to our stockholders.  We may hire additional employees, consultants, and recruit senior executive members as officers and directors, as needed, which persons/entities may be instrumental in forming a new business or we may acquire another business with a full management team already on board.
