Our principal customers include end users of our products in their manufacturing, refining and power generation processes, large engineering companies that build installations for companies in such industries, and the original equipment manufacturers who combine our products with their equipment prior to its sale to end users.  
 
Our products are sold by a team of sales engineers we employ directly as well as by independent sales representatives located worldwide.  There may be short periods of time, a fiscal year for example, where one customer may make up greater than 10% of our business.  No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of our business in 2018.  However, if this occurs in multiple years, it is usually not the same customer or project over such a multi-year period.
 
Due to our diversification efforts, our business that supports the U.S. Navy and commercial nuclear market has increased, resulting in greater domestic sales.  Over a business cycle, our domestic sales will generally range between 50% and 75% of total sales.  The mix of domestic and international sales can vary from year to year.  
 
A breakdown of our net sales by geographic area and product class for our fiscal years ended March 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, which we refer to as "fiscal 2018," "fiscal 2017" and "fiscal 2016", respectively, is contained in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and such breakdown is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference. Our backlog at March 31, 2018 was $117,946 compared with $82,590 at March 31, 2017. 
 Our Strengths
 
Our core strengths include:
  
• | We have a value-enhancing sales and development platform. We believe our customer-facing platform of sales, project estimating and application engineering are competitive advantages. We have tools and capabilities to iterate quickly and comprehensively as customers evaluate how best to integrate our equipment into their facilities. We find that our early and deep involvement adds significant value to the process and is an important competitive differentiator in the long sales cycle industries we serve. We believe customers need our engineering and fabrication expertise early in the project life cycle to understand how best to specify our equipment. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are renowned for our strong capabilities to handle complex, custom orders. The orders we receive are extremely complex and the order management platforms in our businesses provide a second competitive differentiator for our company. Typically there is intense interaction between our project management teams and the end user or its engineering firm as product design and quality requirements are finalized after an order is placed. We have built strong capabilities which we believe allows us to successfully execute high quality, engineered-to-order and build-to-spec process-critical equipment. In our markets, order administration, risk management, cost containment, quality and engineering documentation are as important as the equipment itself. The supplier selection process begins with assessing whether a supplier can manage all aspects of an order. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We maintain a responsive, flexible production environment. We believe the operations platform in our businesses is adept at handling low volume, high mix orders that are highly customized fabrications. We also believe that our production environment is much different from a highly engineered standard products business. While certain equipment in a product group may look similar, there are often subtle differences which are required to deliver the desired specification. Also, during production it is not uncommon for customer-driven engineering changes to occur that alter the configuration of what had been initially released into production. The markets that we serve demand this flexible operating model. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We provide robust after-the-sale technical support. Our engineering and service personnel go to customer sites to audit the performance of our equipment, provide operator training and troubleshoot performance issues. Technical service after a sale is important to our customer as we believe their focus is always on leveraging our equipment to maximize its capabilities. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have a highly trained workforce. We maintain a long-tenured, highly skilled and extremely flexible workforce. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | We have a strong balance sheet. We maintain significant cash and investments on hand, and no bank debt, which we believe provides us with the flexibility to pursue our business strategy, including growth by acquisition.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have a high-quality credit facility. Our credit facilities provide us with a $30,000 borrowing capacity that is expandable at our option to provide us with up to a total of $55,000 in borrowing capacity. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
