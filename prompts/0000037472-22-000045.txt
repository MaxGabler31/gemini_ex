Item 1.  Business
General

Flexsteel Industries, Inc., and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) is one of the largest manufacturers, importers, and marketers of residential furniture products in the United States. Product offerings include a wide variety of furniture such as sofas, loveseats, chairs, reclining rocking chairs, swivel rockers, sofa beds, convertible bedding units, occasional tables, desks, dining tables and chairs, kitchen storage, bedroom furniture, and outdoor furniture. A featured component in most of the upholstered furniture is a unique steel drop-in seat spring from which the name “Flexsteel” is derived. The Company distributes its products throughout the United States through its e-commerce channel and direct sales force.

The Company operates in one reportable segment, furniture products. The Company’s furniture products business involves the distribution of manufactured and imported products consisting of a broad line of furniture for the residential market. In fiscal 2020, the Company substantially completed its exit from the Commercial Office and custom design Hospitality product lines which served contract markets. During fiscal 2021, the Company substantially completed its restructuring activities related to the exit of its Vehicle Seating and the remainder of its Hospitality product lines, which also served contract markets. Set forth below is information for the past three fiscal years showing the Company’s net sales attributable to each of the areas of application:

Manufacturing and Offshore Sourcing

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company operated manufacturing facilities located in Dublin, Georgia, and Juarez, Mexico. These ongoing manufacturing operations are integral to the Company’s product offerings and distribution strategy by offering smaller and more frequent product runs of a wider product selection. The Company identifies and eliminates manufacturing inefficiencies and adjusts manufacturing schedules on a daily basis to meet customer requirements. The Company has established relationships with key suppliers to ensure prompt delivery of quality component parts. The Company’s production includes the use of selected component parts sourced offshore to enhance value in the marketplace.




The Company integrates manufactured products with finished products acquired from offshore suppliers who can meet quality specifications and scheduling requirements. The Company will continue to pursue and refine this blended strategy, offering customers manufactured goods, products manufactured utilizing imported component parts, and ready-to-deliver imported products. This blended focus on products allows the Company to provide a wide range of price points, styles and product categories to satisfy customer requirements. 

Competition

The furniture industry is highly competitive and includes a large number of U.S. and foreign manufacturers and distributors, none of which dominate the market. The Company competes in markets with a large number of relatively small manufacturers; however, certain competitors have substantially greater sales volumes than the Company. The Company’s products compete based on style, quality, price, delivery, service and durability. The Company believes its patented, guaranteed-for-life Blue Steel Spring, manufacturing and sourcing capabilities, facility locations, commitment to customers, product quality, delivery, service, value and experienced production, sales, marketing and management teams, are some of its competitive advantages. 
Seasonality

The Company’s business is not considered seasonal. 

Foreign Operations

The Company has minimal export sales. On June 30, 2022, the Company had approximately 33 employees located in Asia to ensure Flexsteel’s quality standards are met and to coordinate the delivery of purchased products. The Company leases and operates three manufacturing facilities in Juarez, Mexico and had approximately 1,200 employees located in Mexico on June 30, 2022. The three Juarez facilities totaled 553,000 square feet.

Raw Materials

The Company utilizes various types of wood, fabric, leather, filling material, high carbon spring steel, bar and wire stock, polyurethane foam and other raw materials in manufacturing furniture. The Company purchases these materials from numerous outside suppliers, both U.S. and foreign, and is not dependent upon any single source of supply. The costs of certain raw materials fluctuate, but all continue to be readily available within supplier lead-times however, we could experience supply-chain disruptions at any time, which could impact the availability of materials
