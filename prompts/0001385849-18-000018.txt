Business Overview
Energy Fuels is engaged in conventional and in situ recovery (“ISR”) uranium extraction and recovery, along with the exploration, permitting, and evaluation of uranium properties in the United States. Its corporate offices are in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area, and all of its assets and employees are in the western United States. Energy Fuels owns the Nichols Ranch Uranium Recovery Facility in Wyoming (the “Nichols Ranch Project”), which is one of the newest uranium recovery facilities operating in the United States, and the Alta Mesa Project in Texas (the "Alta Mesa Project"), which is a fully-permitted ISR production facility currently on care and maintenance. In addition, Energy Fuels owns the White Mesa Mill in Utah (the “White Mesa Mill” or “Mill”), which is the only conventional uranium recovery facility operating in the United States. The Company also owns uranium and uranium/vanadium properties and projects in various stages of exploration, permitting, and evaluation, as well as fully-permitted uranium and uranium/vanadium projects, and a uranium/copper project, on standby. The White Mesa Mill can also recover vanadium as a by-product of mineralized material produced from certain of its projects in Colorado and Utah, and is 
11

evaluating recovering copper as a by-product from a uranium/copper project in Arizona. In addition, Energy Fuels recovers uranium from other uranium-bearing materials not derived from conventional material, referred to as “alternate feed materials,” at its White Mesa Mill.
ISR Operations
The Company conducts its ISR activities through its Nichols Ranch Project in northeast Wyoming, which it acquired in June 2015 through its acquisition of Uranerz Energy Corporation (“Uranerz”), and its Alta Mesa Project in south Texas, which it acquired in June 2016 through its acquisition of Mesteña Uranium, LLC (“Mesteña”), which is now named EFR Alta Mesa LLC ("EFR Alta Mesa"). 
The Nichols Ranch Project includes: (i) a licensed and operating ISR processing facility (the “Nichols Ranch Plant”); (ii) licensed and operating ISR wellfields (the “Nichols Ranch Wellfields”); (iii) additional licensed ISR wellfields planned for future production (the “Jane Dough Property”), and; (iv) a licensed satellite ISR uranium project (the “Hank Project”), which will include an ISR processing plant (the “Hank Satellite Plant”) that, when constructed, will produce loaded-resin, and associated planned wellfields (the “Hank Property”). See “The Nichols Ranch ISR Project” under Item 2 below. Also through the acquisition of Uranerz, the Company acquired the Reno Creek property (the “Reno Creek Property”), West North Butte property (the “West North Butte Property”), and the North Rolling Pin property (the “North Rolling Pin Property”), as well as the Arkose Mining Venture (the “Arkose Mining Venture”), which is a joint venture of Wyoming ISR properties held 81% by Energy Fuels. The Company is currently under contract to sell the Reno Creek Property to Uranium Energy Corp. See “Non-Material Mineral Properties - Other ISR Projects” under Item 2 below.
The Nichols Ranch Project is an operating ISR facility that recovers uranium through a series of injection and recovery wells. Using groundwater fortified with oxygen and sodium bicarbonate, uranium is dissolved within a deposit. The groundwater is then collected in a series of recovery wells and pumped to the Nichols Ranch Plant. The Nichols Ranch Plant creates a yellowcake slurry that is transported by truck to the White Mesa Mill, where it is dried and packaged into drums that are shipped to uranium conversion facilities.
Construction of the Nichols Ranch Plant, other than the elution, drying and packaging circuits, was completed in 2013, and it commenced uranium recovery activities in the second quarter of 2014. In September of 2015, the Company commenced construction of an elution circuit at the Nichols Ranch Plant, which was completed and began operations in February 2016. During 2017, a total of 259,000 pounds of U3O8 were recovered from the Nichols Ranch Project.
The Alta Mesa Project is a fully licensed, permitted and constructed ISR processing facility that has an operating capacity of 1.5 million pounds of uranium per year and comprises 195,501 contiguous acres of land. The Alta Mesa Project is currently on standby and ready to resume production as market conditions warrant; Alta Mesa is expected to be able to reach commercial production levels with limited required capital within approximately twelve months of a production decision. See “The Alta Mesa Project” under Item 2 below.
Conventional Operations
The Company conducts its conventional uranium extraction and recovery activities through its White Mesa Mill, which is the only operating conventional uranium and vanadium processing facility in the United States. The White Mesa Mill, located near Blanding Utah, is centrally located such that it can be fed by a number of the Company’s uranium, uranium/vanadium and uranium/copper projects in Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, as well as by ore purchases or toll milling arrangements with third parties in the region as market conditions warrant.
The White Mesa Mill is a 2,000 ton per day uranium recovery facility, which can also process vanadium as a by-product of mineralized material extracted from certain uranium/vanadium properties, and is evaluating recovering copper as a by-product from a uranium/copper project in Arizona. In addition, the Mill can recycle other uranium-bearing materials not derived from conventional ore, referred to as "alternate feed materials", for the recovery of uranium, alone or in combination with other metals.
The White Mesa Mill has historically operated on a campaign basis, whereby mineral processing occurs as mill feed, contract requirements, and market conditions warrant. Over the years, the Company’s own, and third-party owned, conventional uranium properties in Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico have been both active and on standby, from time-to-time, in response to changing market conditions. From 2007 through 2014, running on a campaign basis, the White Mesa Mill recovered on average over 1 million pounds of  U3O8 per year from conventional sources, including its La Sal Project, Daneros Project, and Tony M property in Utah; its Arizona 1 and Pinenut Projects in Arizona; and alternate feed materials. During 2015, the Mill recovered a total of 296,000 lbs. of U3O8, of which 25,000 pounds were recovered from conventional materials and the remainder from processing alternate feed materials (including 72,000 pounds for the account of a third party). During 2016, the Mill recovered a total of 680,000 lbs. of U3O8, of which 433,000 pounds were recovered from conventional materials from the Company's Pinenut Project and 248,000 pounds from processing alternate feed materials. During 2017, the Mill recovered 310,000 pounds from 
12

processing pond solutions and 1,000,000 pounds from processing alternate feed materials, of which a total of 360,000 pounds were for the Company's account and 950,000 pounds were for the account of third parties. 
The Company’s Pinenut Project, where mineral extraction activities occurred until September 2015, is now depleted, and reclamation activities have commenced. The Company continues to receive and process alternate feed materials at the White Mesa Mill. At the Company’s permitted Canyon Project, an underground drilling project has been completed, and a new shaft was completed in the first quarter of 2018. The timing to extract and process mineralized material from the Canyon Project will be based on market conditions, available financing, and sales requirements. All of the Company’s other conventional properties and projects are currently in the permitting process or on standby pending improvements in market conditions. No third party conventional properties are active at this time.
The Company also owns the Sheep Mountain Project (the “Sheep Mountain Project”), which is a conventional uranium extraction project located in Wyoming. Due to its distance from the White Mesa Mill, the Sheep Mountain Project is not expected to be a source of feed material for the Mill. The Sheep Mountain Project consists of permitted open pit and underground extraction components (the “Sheep Mountain Extraction Operation”) and a planned processing facility to process extracted mineralized material (the “Sheep Mountain Processing Operation”), which has not yet been permitted.
The Company’s principal conventional properties include the following:

• | the White Mesa Mill, a 2,000 ton per day uranium and vanadium processing facility, which is also evaluating recovering copper as a by-product from the Company's Canyon Project, located near Blanding, Utah, held through the Company’s subsidiary EFR White Mesa LLC.

Mineral Exploration
Energy Fuels holds a number of exploration properties in the Colorado Plateau, White Canyon, Grants, Arizona Strip, and Powder River Basin Districts. Energy Fuels has conducted intermittent exploration drilling on numerous projects in the period from February 2007 through December 2013. Several of those projects have been abandoned or sold. No exploration drilling was performed in 2014, 2015, 2016 or 2017. See “Non-Material Mineral Properties” under Item 2 below.
Development of the Business -- Major Transactions over the Past Five Years
Over the past five years, the Company has completed the following major transactions:

2017 Corporate Developments
On May 17, 2017, the Board appointed Messrs. Benjamin Eshleman III and Robert W. Kirkwood to serve as Directors of the Company pursuant to the Board's power to increase the size of the Board by up to one-third in number between annual meetings of shareholders. Messrs. Glenn Catchpole and Ron Hochstein did not stand for re-election as Directors at the Company's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, and therefore ceased to be Directors effective May 17, 2017.
Effective June 12, 2017, Ames Brown resigned as a Director of the Company.
Effective July 1, 2017, the Company appointed Mark S. Chalmers as President and Chief Operating Officer. 
On November 2, 2017, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its non-core Reno Creek Property to Uranium Energy Corp. ("UEC") for $5.39 million, including $2.94 million of cash and $2.45 million shares of UEC that will be priced upon the closing of the transaction. The Company expects this transaction to be completed in Q1-2018.
On November 13, 2017, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with Excalibur Industries to acquire and extinguish royalties on its Nichols Ranch Project as well as acquire and hold royalties on nearby operating and permitted ISR uranium projects owned by Cameco for approximately $3.5 million, subject to certain adjustments. This consideration will be payable in common shares at closing, which will be priced based on the volume-weighted average price ("VWAP") of Energy Fuels' shares on the NYSE American for the five most recent trading days ending on the last trading day prior to closing. Through the transaction, the Company will acquire a 6% - 8% sliding-scale gross proceeds production royalty on Energy Fuels' Nichols Ranch Project. This royalty also applies to other properties owned by the Company nearby. After closing, the Company expects to extinguish these royalties. Energy Fuels is also acquiring the 4% gross proceeds production royalty on Cameco's North Butte/Brown Ranch Project ("North Butte"), the Ruby Ranch Project, and the Greasewood property. North Butte is a fully permitted and operational project that has been operated by Cameco as a satellite to their Smith Ranch-Highland ISR Project since 2013. This transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018.
On December 29, 2017, the Company amended its existing Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (“Cantor”), to extend its ability to sell from time to time at its discretion, through Cantor as agent, common shares by way of an “at-the-market” offering (the “ATM”). Sales of the shares, if any, would occur by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions or block trades, with sales only being made on the NYSE American at market prices. Any decision to undertake sales of common shares pursuant to the ATM would be at the Company’s sole discretion. No common shares will be offered or sold through the ATM on the TSX. In connection with the ATM, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to its U.S. registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Registration Statement”), qualifying for distribution up to $30 million in common shares under the extended ATM.
Company Strategy
Energy Fuels intends to continue to strengthen its position as a leading uranium extraction and recovery company in the United States. Through the operating White Mesa Mill, the operating Nichols Ranch Project, the standby Alta Mesa Project, our large 
14

uranium resource base, and existing conventional projects on standby, under construction, and in permitting, the Company’s strategy is to remain a unique and valuable call option on increases in the price of uranium, with significant scalability in improved market conditions. The Company is also pursuing revenue-generating opportunities at its White Mesa Mill through potential vanadium recovery and land clean-up work. The Company currently intends to maintain its ISR and conventional uranium recovery capabilities, its uranium resource base, and its scalability. However, continued weakness in uranium prices; an inability to generate sufficient revenues from alternate feed materials, potential land cleanup work and vanadium opportunities; and/or cash needs may dictate that the Company engage in further measures to maintain the value of this option. 
As a result of the foregoing, we intend to maintain the value of the Company as a call option on increases in the price of uranium, while conserving cash, by engaging in the following activities:

• | Produce from existing wellfields (wellfields #1 through #9) at Nichols Ranch and defer further wellfield development at Nichols Ranch until uranium prices improve;


• | Continue alternate feed processing and recovery of uranium from uranium dissolved in the Mill’s ponds, as well as pursue additional alternate feed materials and other sources of feed for the Mill, including potential vanadium recovery and material generated from land cleanup work;


•


• | Complete installation of the sump at the Canyon Project in the first quarter of 2018, after which time all field activities will have been completed. The Company plans to continue to carry out engineering, procurement and construction management activities in 2018; 


• | Continue evaluating the possibility of recovering copper at the White Mesa Mill as a by-product from the Canyon Project and pursue any permitting actions that may be required;


• | Continue to maintain standby projects and facilities (including the Canyon Project, Alta Mesa Project, the La Sal Project and the Daneros Project) in a state of readiness for the purpose of restarting mining activities, as market conditions may warrant. At this time, all of the Company’s conventional projects are expected to remain on standby until market conditions warrant restarting mining activities, or are in the evaluation or permitting process;


• | Continue permitting activities for the Roca Honda Project through the end of 2018;


• | Continue to pursue an appropriate trade remedy that properly recognizes the value of uranium produced in the U.S., as proposed in the Petition (see Subsequent Events, below);


• | Continue to evaluate the sale or abandonment of non-core assets that the Company does not believe contribute to shareholder value in order to reduce costs and/or receive sales proceeds; and


• | Continue to pursue additional cost cutting measures.

Subsequent Events
On January 16, 2018, the Company and Ur-Energy (the "Petitioners") announced that they had jointly filed a Petition (the "Petition") for Relief with the U.S. Department of Commerce ("DOC") under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (as amended) from Imports of Uranium Products that Threaten U.S. National Security. The Petition describes how uranium and nuclear fuel from state-owned and state-subsidized enterprises in Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and China potentially represent a threat to U.S. national security. The Petition seeks remedies which will set a quota to limit imports of uranium into the U.S., effectively reserving 25% of the U.S. nuclear market for U.S. uranium production. Additionally, the Petition suggests implementation of a requirement for U.S. federal utilities and agencies to buy U.S. uranium in accordance with the President's Buy American Policy. The remedies proposed by the Petitioners are expected to strengthen the U.S. uranium mining industry, bolster national defense, and improve supply diversification for U.S. utilities and their customers. It should be noted, however, that there can be no certainty of the outcome of the investigation or the recommendation of the Secretary, and therefore the outcome of this process is uncertain. 
On January 31, 2018, Stephen P. Antony retired from his position as Chief Executive Officer and a Director of the Company, and on February 1, 2018 Mark S. Chalmers was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer and a Director of the Company.
On February 14, 2018, Mr. W. Paul Goranson, the former Executive Vice President, Operations, was appointed as Chief Operating Officer of the Company, reporting to the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Mr. Matthew 
15

Tarnowski, the former Controller of the Company, was appointed as Chief Accounting Officer and Controller of the Company, reporting to the Chief Financial Officer of the Company. 
On March 1, 2018, Daniel G. Zang resigned from his position as Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and on March 2, 2018, Mr. David C. Frydenlund, the former Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of the Company, was appointed as Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of the Company, reporting to the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
On March 8, 2018, the Board appointed Barbara A. Filas as a Director of the Company effective March 12, 2018, to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Mr. Ames Brown from the Board.
Uranium Sales
The Company has four existing contracts, which require deliveries of 650,000 pounds of U3O8 in 2018. Of this, a total of 400,000 pounds of U3O8 is required to be sourced from the Company’s uranium recovery operations, while Energy Fuels has the option to fulfill the remaining 250,000 pounds of U3O8 from the Company’s uranium recovery operations and/or open market purchases. At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 615,000 pounds of finished goods inventory from the Company’s uranium recovery operations.
In 2018, the Company expects to have sufficient existing inventory or uranium recovery to meet all of its commitments to sell 650,000 pounds of uranium under its existing contracts.
Of the 650,000 pounds of expected sales in 2018, 50,000 pounds are being sold at $24.75 per pound, 400,000 pounds are being sold at a fixed price of $61.30 per pound, and 200,000 pounds are being sold at a 0.5% discount to spot prices in effect at the times of delivery. Additional selective spot sales may be made in 2018 as necessary to generate cash for operations.
Overview of Uranium Market
The primary commercial use of uranium is to fuel nuclear power plants for the generation of electricity. All of the uranium extracted from Energy Fuels’ projects is expected to be used for this purpose.
According to the World Nuclear Association (“WNA”), as of January 2018, there are currently 447 operable nuclear reactors world-wide, which required approximately 169 million pounds of U3O8 fuel in 2017 at full operation. Worldwide there are currently 58 new reactors under construction with an additional 157 reactors on order or in the planning stage, and another 351 which have been proposed.
According to data from TradeTech LLC (“TradeTech”), the world continues to require more uranium than it produces from primary extraction, largely due to increasing uranium demands in Asia. The gap between demand and primary supply is filled by stockpiled inventories and secondary supplies.
According to the WNA, the United States currently has 99 operating reactors, two reactors under construction, and another 35 reactors on order, planned or proposed. According to the Nuclear Energy Institute ("NEI"), the United States produced approximately 19.7% of its electricity from nuclear technology and avoided 554 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2016. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency (“EIA”), U.S. utilities purchased approximately 56.5 million pounds of U3O8 in 2016. However, in 2016 the U.S. only produced approximately 2.9 million pounds of U3O8. As a result, in 2016, the U.S. fulfilled only about 5% of its demand from domestic primary mine production. According to published EIA data, the U.S. produced 2.42 million pounds of U3O8 in 2017, including 1.47 million pounds of mine production and 0.95 million pounds of previously mined production that was reprocessed at the Company’s White Mesa Mill.
Uranium is not traded on an open market or organized commodity exchange such as the London Metal Exchange, although the New York Mercantile Exchange provides financially-settled uranium futures contracts. Typically, buyers and sellers negotiate transactions privately and directly. Spot uranium transactions typically involve deliveries that occur immediately and up to 12 months in the future. Term uranium transactions typically involve deliveries that occur more than 12 months in the future, with long-term transactions involving delivery terms of at least three years. Uranium prices, both spot and term, are published by two independent market consulting firms, TradeTech and The Ux Consulting Company (“Ux”), on a weekly and monthly basis. Other brokers, including Numerco Ltd., Uranium Markets LLC, and Evolution Markets Inc., also publish daily broker average uranium prices.
The spot and term prices of uranium are influenced by a number of global factors. For example, both the spot and term prices of uranium were negatively impacted by the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant in March 2011. The events at Fukushima created heightened concerns regarding the safety of nuclear plants and led to both temporary and permanent closures of nuclear plants around the world. The Fukushima incident has created downward pressure on uranium prices over the past seven years, 
16

which is still being felt today. In contrast, China is pursuing an aggressive nuclear program, with 38 units now operating, 20 new units under construction, 39 units which are planned, and 143 units that have been proposed, according to January 2018 WNA data.
Historically, most nuclear utilities have sought to purchase a portion of their uranium needs through mid- and long-term supply contracts, while other portions are bought on the spot market. Like sellers, buyers seek to balance the security of supply with the opportunity to take advantage of lower prices caused by volatility in prices. For this reason, both buyers and sellers track current spot and term prices for uranium carefully, make considered projections as to future prices, and negotiate with one another on transactions which each deems favorable to their respective interests.
The graph below shows the monthly spot (blue line) and long-term (red line) uranium price from August 1969 until February 2018 as reported by TradeTech (not adjusted for inflation):
To give a more recent perspective, the graph below shows the monthly spot (blue line) and long-term (red line) uranium price from January 2013 until February 2018 as reported by TradeTech (not adjusted for inflation):
According to monthly price data from TradeTech, uranium prices during 2017 were up $3.50, or 17% for the year. Monthly spot prices began the year at $20.25 per pound of U3O8 on December 31, 2016 and ended the year at $23.75 per pound, reaching a high of $24.50 per pound for the month of January 2017 and a low of $19.95 per pound for the month of May 2017. According to Trade Tech, the spot price was $22.25 per pound on March 2, 2018. TradeTech price data also indicated that long-term U3O8 prices began 2017 at $30.00 per pound and ended 2017 at $31.00 per pound. The high long-term price for 2017 was $35.00 per pound for February, March, and April, and the low long-term price was $30.00 per pound for September and October. The long-term price at February 28, 2018 was $29.00 per pound. The Company believes the weak uranium markets are the result of excess uranium supplies caused by large quantities of secondary uranium extraction and excess inventories, the availability of low-priced spot material, the delayed restart of Japanese reactors, insufficient production cut-backs especially from state-owned and state-subsidized uranium and uranium fuel entities, premature reactor closures, and continued weak uranium demand.

Uranium Market Outlook and Uranium Marketing Strategy
World demand for clean, reliable, and affordable baseload electricity is growing. As a result of the expected growth of nuclear energy, the Company believes the long-term fundamentals of the uranium industry remain positive. The Company believes prices must rise to higher levels to support the new primary production that will be required to meet the increasing demand we expect to see as more nuclear units are constructed around the world. According to TradeTech, world uranium requirements continue to exceed primary mine production, with the gap being bridged by secondary supplies and excess uranium inventories in various forms that have already been mined. In addition, it is the Company's belief that additional mine production cutbacks will be required to bring the market into balance in the short and medium terms. However, a large portion of global uranium production is state-owned and state-subsidized, and therefore not subject to normal market fundamentals. It is for this reason that the Company and Ur-Energy submitted the Petition to the U.S. Department of Commerce to initiate an investigation into the effects of uranium imports on U.S. national security. The Petitioners have proposed a quota system that limits uranium and uranium fuel imports, effectively reserving 25% of the U.S. nuclear market for U.S. uranium producers. At the current time, less than 5% of U.S. reactor demand is met by new production from U.S. uranium mines. The Company has believed for several years that uranium prices, and long-term contracting levels in particular, will need to rise to levels that are sufficient to incentivize new mine production. However, it is the Company's belief that non free-market forces have delayed this recovery. The Petition is intended to help address this situation.
The Company believes prices likely hit a bottom in 2016, and despite considerable market uncertainty in 2017, the lows of 2016 were not repeated in 2017. In January 2017, it was announced that Kazakhstan would reduce 2017 uranium production by 10% (5 million+ lbs.) after several years of production increases. In November 2017, Cameco announced that it was temporarily suspending production from its McArthur River/Key Lake project for 10 months, which is among the largest and lowest cost uranium production facilities in the world. According to Royal Bank of Canada, this is expected to remove 17-18 million pounds of uranium production during 2018. If the suspension is extended, even more uranium will be removed from the market. In addition, in December 2017, Kazakhstan's state-owned uranium mining enterprise, Kazatomprom, announced further production cuts amounting to a total of 28.6 million pounds of uranium during 2018-2020. Although subsequent announcements by Kazakh government officials have put some doubt into the true scale of these cutbacks, it is the Company's belief that cuts to production in Kazakhstan will occur but not at the levels stated in the December 2017 announcement. On a longer-term basis, according to data from TradeTech and the WNA, Chinese utilities continue to aggressively build new reactors. In addition to China, according to the WNA, there are large numbers of new reactors under construction and in various stages of planning around the world.
In the short- and medium-terms, market challenges remain. The world continues to be oversupplied with uranium, mainly due to large quantities of secondary and other inelastic uranium supplies (including enricher underfeeding and state-owned and state-subsidized uranium and nuclear fuel production), high levels of excess inventories, insufficient producer cut-backs, premature reactor shutdowns, delays in new reactor construction, two large new mines coming into production (Cigar Lake and Husab), and decreased demand due to Japanese reactors remaining offline for longer than expected. Though it should be noted that Husab continues to experience start-up delays and its 2.2 million lbs. of uranium production in 2017 did not meet TradeTech's forecast of 4 million lbs. In addition, conflicting announcements on the scale of Kazakh production cuts in 2018-2020 and the filing of the Petition by the Company and Ur-Energy may be causing some market participants to take a wait-and-see approach in the short-term. There remains a great deal of uncertainty in uranium prices regarding the timing and level of the recovery, as fundamental, political, technical, and other factors could cause prices to be significantly above or below currently expected ranges.
Nevertheless, according to data from Trade Tech, global utilities have nearly 600 million lbs. of uncovered uranium requirements through 2025, which the Company expects will increase levels of market activity at some point in the future.
The Company’s marketing strategy is to seek a base of earnings and cash flow through sales of a portion of its uranium into term contracts, to the extent such contracts are available at satisfactory prices. To gain exposure to increasing uranium prices, the Company seeks to sell a portion of its planned uranium extraction into contracts with market-related formulas, if available at satisfactory prices, and through future spot and term sales. Further exposure to increasing uranium prices can be generated through the Company’s ability to bring additional uranium extraction online in the future in response to increasing prices, which can be sold on a market-related or fixed basis at then prevailing prices. 
During 2017, the pricing on all of the Company’s contracts, other than the spot contract referenced above, were at their floors or at prices fixed by the contract. During 2017, the Company sold 520,000 pounds of U3O8 at a weighted- average price of $47.05 per pound. This included 320,000 pounds of sales under contracts at a weighted average price of $62.72 per pound and 200,000 pounds into contracts based on spot market prices at a weighted average price of $21.99 per pound. 
In 2018, the Company expects to sell a total of 650,000 pounds of U3O8 into its four existing contracts at pricing expected to average approximately $48.00 per pound based on the fixed prices contained in three of the contracts and current forecasts of spot prices and price inflation in the other contract. In Q1-2018 the Company amended its remaining long-term contracts with one customer, so that all remaining deliveries of 400,000 lbs. under the contracts will occur in April 2018 at a fixed price of $61.30 
18

per pound; including moving 200,000 lbs. of deliveries originally scheduled for 2019 and 2020 up to April 2018. The Company also has a contract for the delivery of 50,000 lbs. in Q1-2018 at a fixed price of $24.75 per pound and a contract for the delivery of 200,000 lbs. in 2018 with pricing at a 0.5% discount to the spot price at the time of delivery. Additional selective spot sales may be made in 2018 as necessary to generate cash for operations. As a result of these amendments, the Company will have no further long-term contractual obligations following its 2018 deliveries. All uranium sales after 2018 will therefore be at spot prices and unhedged, unless the Company enters into new long-term contracts at satisfactory prices in the future.
The Vanadium Market 
The White Mesa Mill has historically recovered vanadium as a by-product of uranium from certain of its properties on the Colorado Plateau, most notably from the La Sal Project, as well as from properties owned by third-parties on the Colorado Plateau through toll milling and similar arrangements, when the price of vanadium has been high enough to justify its recovery. The Mill’s most recent vanadium recovery occurred in 2013 when it recovered 1.5 million pounds of vanadium.
Vanadium is a metallic element that, when converted into ferrovanadium ("FeV") (an alloy of vanadium and iron), is used primarily as an additive to strengthen and harden steel. According to market consultant Roskill, over 90% of FeV is used in the steel industry. In addition, vanadium continues to see interest in energy storage technologies, including vanadium redox flow batteries. China is the largest global producer of vanadium, accounting for roughly 44% of production in 2016 with additional production coming from Russia, South Africa, and Brazil (Roskill). Vanadium (as V2O5) prices were up sharply in 2017, beginning the year at $5.03 per pound, and ending the year at $9.75 per pound, reaching a high of $11.13 per pound in September 2017 (Metal Bulletin information received from the U.S. DOE). Vanadium prices are currently at $14.25 per pound. 
According to Roskill, prices have risen primarily as a result of tightening supplies in China, including the shutdown of vanadium producing facilities for environmental reasons. In addition, the closure of the Evraz Highveld facility in South Africa has added to market tightness (Roskill). On the demand side, increasingly stringent building requirements, particularly in China, are requiring the use of rebar that contains vanadium (Roskill).
In the past, Energy Fuels has sold its vanadium both as V2O5 and as ferrovanadium (“FeV”) through spot sales to industry end-users and trading companies. No vanadium has been recovered or sold by the Company since 2013. The Company is currently evaluating certain opportunities in the vanadium space, including the potential to recover vanadium dissolved in the ponds at the White Mesa Mill, re-opening mines that contain vanadium resources, and/or recovering vanadium from non-ore sources.
The Copper Market 
The White Mesa Mill has not produced copper. Due to the discovery of significant quantities of copper mineralization at the Canyon Project, the Company is investigating potential alternatives for recovering copper as a byproduct of uranium recovery at the White Mesa Mill.
Copper is a malleable and ductile metallic element that has a number of industrial uses, including as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a building material, in industrial machinery, and as a component of certain metal alloys. According to the International Copper Study Group ("ICSG"), an intergovernmental organization that operates as the international commodity board for copper, the major product categories of the copper trade are: copper concentrates, copper blister and anode, refined copper cathode and ingots, copper scrap, copper semis, and a small amount of copper powders and compounds. Copper is mainly shipped by producers to fabricators as cathode, wire rod, billet, cake (slab), or ingot. Two of the key components of the copper market are the spot price (settlement price for a transaction today) and the future price. A futures or option contract defines the price of the delivery, the quantity of the product, the delivery date(s), and delivery location(s) and other aspects. Three main commodity exchanges provide the facilities to trade copper: the London Metal Exchange (LME), Commodity Exchange Division of the New York Mercantile Exchange (COMEX/NYMEX), and the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE). 
According to the United States Geological Survey ("USGS"), the top global primary copper producers in 2016 were Chile, Peru, China, the United States, and Australia. In 2016, the U.S. had 24 mines that recovered copper with the top copper producing states being Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, and Montana. In addition in 2016, the U.S. had three primary smelters, three electrolytic and four fire refineries, and fifteen electrowinning facilities that operated. According to Mining.com, the top copper producing companies globally are Codelco, Freeport-McMoRan, Glencore International, BHP Billiton, and Southern Copper. In addition to primary mining, recycling is also a significant source of copper, and recycled copper is indistinguishable from primary copper (ICSG). According to Investopedia, the price of copper is driven by a number of factors including strength and weakness in the U.S. dollar, oil prices, global demand, including China, the cost of production, labor relations, natural disasters/phenomena, and geopolitical events. The spot price of copper rose by approximately 28% during 2017 (London Metal Exchange). According to Goldman Sachs, the price of copper rose in 2017 primarily due to currency effects, global growth, and demand factors. Copper prices are currently at $3.08 per pound. 
Competition
19

The uranium industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with mining and exploration companies for uranium sales, the acquisition of uranium mineral properties, and the procurement of equipment, materials and personnel necessary to explore, develop, and extract uranium from such properties. There is competition for a limited number of uranium acquisition opportunities, including competition with other companies having substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities than the Company. As a result, the Company may encounter challenges in acquiring attractive properties, and exploring and advancing properties currently in the Company’s portfolio. In addition, Energy Fuels competes with other uranium recovery companies, along with traders, brokers, financial institutions, converters, enrichers, and other market actors, including some that are state-owned and state-subsidized, for uranium sales. Due to the Company’s limited capital and personnel and the relative size of its operations, the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to some other companies with regard to exploration and, if warranted, development of mining properties and securing uranium sales. The Company believes that competition for acquiring mineral prospects and completing uranium sales will continue to be intense in the future.
The availability of funds for exploration, evaluation, permitting and construction of uranium projects is limited, and the Company may find it difficult to compete with larger and more established uranium exploration and production companies for capital. The Company’s inability to continue exploration, advancement, and the acquisition of new properties due to lack of funding could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future operations and financial position.
Government Regulation
The Company’s properties and facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations which are overseen and enforced by multiple federal, state and local authorities. These laws govern exploration, construction, extraction, recovery, processing, exports, various taxes, labor standards, occupational health and safety, waste disposal, protection and remediation of the environment, protection of endangered and protected species, toxic and hazardous substances, and other matters. Uranium minerals exploration, extraction, recovery, and processing are also subject to risks and liabilities associated with the perceived potential for pollution of the environment and disposal of waste products occurring as a result of such activities.
Compliance with these laws and regulations may impose substantial costs on the Company and will subject the Company to significant potential liabilities. Changes in these regulations could require the Company to expend significant resources to comply with new laws or regulations or changes to current requirements and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business operations.
Environmental Regulations
Exploration, development, and extraction activities are subject to certain environmental regulations which may prevent or delay the continuance of our activities. In general, our exploration, evaluation, and extraction activities are subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control. Such laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation. Specifically, we are subject to legislation regarding emissions into the environment, water discharges, and storage and disposition of hazardous wastes. In addition, legislation has been enacted which requires facility sites to be reclaimed in accordance with such legislation. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our operations or financial condition to date.
Uranium milling in the U.S. is primarily regulated by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the “NRC”) pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Its primary function is to ensure the protection of employees, the public, and the environment from radioactive materials, and it also regulates most aspects of the uranium recovery process. The NRC regulations pertaining to uranium recovery facilities are codified in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
On August 16, 2004, the State of Utah became an Agreement State for the regulation of uranium mills. This means that the primary regulator for the White Mesa Mill is now the State of Utah Department of Environmental Quality (“UDEQ”) rather than the NRC. At that time, the Mill’s NRC Source Material License was transferred to the State of Utah and became a Radioactive Materials License, which was recently renewed in January 2018. The State of Utah incorporates, through its own regulations or by reference, all aspects of Title 10 pertaining to uranium recovery facilities. When the State of Utah became an Agreement State, it required that a Groundwater Discharge Permit (“GWDP”) be put in place for the White Mesa Mill. The GWDP is required for all similar facilities in the State of Utah, and specifically tailors the implementation of the state groundwater regulations to the Mill site. The State of Utah requires that every operating uranium mill have a GWDP, regardless of whether or not the facility discharges to groundwater. The GWDP for the Mill was finalized and implemented in March 2005 and recently renewed in January 2018. The White Mesa Mill also maintains a permit approval for air emissions with the UDEQ, Division of Air Quality.

Conventional uranium extraction is subject to regulation by a number of agencies including: (1) local county and municipal government agencies; (2) the applicable state divisions responsible for mining and protecting the environment within Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming; (3) the BLM and the United States Forest Service (the “USFS”) on public lands under their jurisdiction; (4) the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”); (5) the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) for radon emissions from underground mines; and (6) other federal agencies (e.g., U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corp. of Engineers, and DOE), where certain conditions exist. In addition, a uranium processing facility at the Sheep Mountain Project will be subject to regulation under the NRC, as a uranium processing facility and for permanent disposal of the resulting tailings.
The provisions of the Atomic Energy Act and its regulations that are applicable to uranium milling also apply to our ISR facilities in Wyoming and Texas. The Nichols Ranch Project and the Alta Mesa Project each have a Source Material license. The Nichols Ranch Source Material License was issued by the NRC. However, because Texas is an Agreement State, the Alta Mesa Source Material License was issued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. ISR facilities are also regulated by the State of Wyoming and State of Texas, respectively, and the EPA under the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. In addition, ISR wellfields require an Underground Injection Control Permit under the Safe Drinking Water Act, as administered by the EPA. ISR operations are subject to regulations by the U.S. Occupational, Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), rather than MSHA.
Reclamation bonds or the equivalent have been posted for each of the Company’s material properties that have structures or facilities.
Energy Fuels is required to have export licenses issued by the NRC for its uranium exports. Such licenses are obtained by the Company as required.
Land Tenure
The Company’s land holdings are held either by leases from the fee simple owners (private parties or the State) or unpatented mining claims located on property owned and managed by the U.S. Federal Government. Annual fees must be paid to maintain unpatented mining claims, but work expenditures are not required. Holders of unpatented mining claims are generally granted surface access to conduct mineral exploration and extraction activities. However, additional permits and plans are generally required prior to conducting exploration or mining activities on such claims.
On July 9, 2009, BLM issued a Notice of Proposed Withdrawal (“2009 Notice”) under which it proposed that a total of approximately one million acres of public lands around the Grand Canyon National Park be withdrawn from location and entry under the Mining Law of 1872 (the “Mining Law”), subject to valid existing rights. In the 2009 Notice, BLM stated that the purpose of the withdrawal, if determined to be appropriate, would be to protect the Grand Canyon watershed from any adverse effects of locatable hardrock mineral exploration and mining. The 2009 Notice segregated the lands from location and entry under the mining laws for up to two years to allow time for various studies and analyses, including appropriate NEPA analysis. In order to allow more time for BLM to complete its NEPA analysis, the U.S. Department of the Interior (the “DOI”) published Public Land Order 7773 on June 21, 2011, which effected a six-month emergency withdrawal of the area. The emergency withdrawal prevented the lands from being open to location and entry under the Mining Law upon expiration of the two-year segregation while the DOI completed the decision–making process on the proposed withdrawal. The emergency withdrawal was effective July 21, 2011 to January 20, 2012. During the two-year segregation and six month emergency withdrawal, the BLM, along with its cooperating agencies, completed various studies and analyses of resources in the withdrawal area, including an EIS under NEPA. These studies and analyses were undertaken to provide the basis for the final decision regarding whether or not to proceed with the proposed withdrawal or to select an alternative action. Based on this analysis, on January 9, 2012, the DOI announced its final decision to withdraw from location and entry under the Mining Law, subject to valid existing rights, the total of approximately one million acres of lands originally proposed in the 2009 Notice (the “Withdrawn Lands”), for a 20-year period. Lawsuits challenging this decision were filed by various industry groups and interested parties.
No new mining claims may be filed on the Withdrawn Lands and no new Plans of Operations may be approved, other than Plans of Operations on mining claims that were valid at the time of withdrawal and that remain valid at the time of plan approval. Whether or not a mining claim is valid must be determined by a mineral examination conducted by BLM or USFS, as applicable. The mineral examination, which involves an economic evaluation of a project, must demonstrate the existence of a locatable mineral resource and that the mineral resource constitutes the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit.
21

All of the Company’s properties located on the Arizona Strip, with the exception of its Wate property and certain exploration properties held by the Company’s subsidiary, Arizona Strip Partners LLC, are located within the Withdrawn Lands. A mineral examination on the Company’s EZ Project will need to be completed by BLM, in conjunction with its review of the Company’s proposed Plan of Operations for that project. Mineral examinations were not required for the Company’s Arizona 1 and Pinenut projects, which had previously approved Plans of Operations and were recently active. Although the Company’s Canyon Project also has an approved Plan of Operation, and a mineral examination is not required, the USFS performed a mineral examination on that project in 2012 and concluded that the Canyon Project’s claims constitute valid existing rights. The USFS also concluded that no additional approvals are required on the Canyon Project.
The Company believes that all of its material projects within the Withdrawn Lands are on valid mining claims that will each withstand a mineral examination. However, market conditions may postpone or prevent the performance of mineral examinations on certain properties and, if a mineral examination is performed on a property, there can be no guarantee that the mineral examination would not result in one of more of the Company’s mining claims being considered invalid, which could prevent a project from proceeding.
Further, there have been efforts to create a National Monument on the Withdrawn Lands, and additional lands, near the Grand Canyon National Park. These efforts have included proposed legislation which was introduced in Congress and lobbying of the President of the United States to create a National Monument utilizing his executive powers under the Antiquities Act of 1906. However, in December 2016, President Obama decided not to grant monument status to the 1.7 million acres proposed for inclusion. 
In addition, President Obama designated the Bears Ears National Monument by executive order in December of 2016, which comprised 1.35 million acres of land in San Juan County, Utah. The designated land included a portion of the County road which the Company relies on for access to its Daneros Project as well as abutted a portion of the property boundary of the White Mesa Mill and encompassed two water sampling sites the Company monitors for the Mill. In December, 2017, President Trump issued a Proclamation that amended President Obama’s 2016 Proclamation and reduced the monument to two parcels encompassing a total of 201,876 acres, releasing 1.15 million acres. That Proclamation has been challenged in Federal Court. The closest boundaries of the reduced monument to any of the Company’s operations are respectively approximately 6 miles from the White Mesa Mill and approximately 15 miles from the Daneros Project. It is possible that the Daneros Project and/or the White Mesa Mill could become subject to additional requirements, restrictions and costs if the original designation is upheld in Court.
