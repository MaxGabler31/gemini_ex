OUR BUSINESS
 
Company Business Model
 
NetSol believes that strong technology solutions with provable returns on investment are required to sell to its globally competitive and mature marketplace. NetSol believes that people are the drivers of success and we invest in hiring, training and retaining top-notch staff to ensure not only successful selling but also the ongoing satisfaction of our clients. Taken together, this “selling and attentive servicing” approach creates a distinctive advantage for NetSol and a unique value for our customers. NetSol continues to underpin this effective business model with a combination of careful cost arbitrage, subject matter expertise, domain experience, scalability and proximity with our global and regional customers.
Niche Market Focus
 
By specializing in leasing and financing solutions, we have gained footholds in several global locations and a market leading position in the captive auto-finance segment and a growing presence in the general asset finance space.
Subject Matter Expertise
 
Our dual expertise in enterprise technology implementation and financial application development has helped us emerge as a global contender in the lease and finance industry and secure a broad footprint throughout the major markets of North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. The Asia Pacific operating region has particularly benefitted from the organic growth in the fast-developing leasing automation industry, which is still nascent by Western standards.
Domain Experience
 
NetSol has a strong presence in the captive auto-finance domain. With a collective experience of over two decades in Asia Pacific and over three decades in North America and Europe, NetSol is one of a few global competitors in this niche industry.
Proximity with Global and Regional Customers
 
The Company has offices across the world, located strategically to maintain close contact and proximity with its customers in various key markets. This has helped in strengthening customer relationships and building a deeper understanding of local market dynamics. Simultaneously, the Company is able to extend services and even development support through a combination of local/onsite and central/off-site resources. This approach allows the Company to offer blended rates to its customers by employing a unique and cost effective global development model.
 
While our business model is built around the development, implementation and maintenance of our suite of financial applications, under NFS™, NetSol has employed the same facilities and competencies to extend its offerings into related segments, including:
 

● | IT consulting & services 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------
● | business intelligence 
● | information security 
● | independent system review 
● | outsourcing services and software process improvement consulting 
● | maintenance and support of existing systems 
● | project management 
● | technology/start-up incubation 

 
Our global operation is broken down into three regions: North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. All of the subsidiaries are seamlessly integrated to function effectively with global delivery capabilities, cross selling to multinational asset finance companies, leveraging a centralized marketing and pre-sales organization and, a network of employees connected across the globe to support local and global customers and partners.

OUR SOLUTIONS
 
NetSol Financial Suite™ 
 
NetSol’s offerings include its flagship global solution, NFS™. A robust suite of four software applications that is an end-to-end solution for the asset finance industry covering the complete leasing and finance cycle starting from quotation origination through end of contract transactions and including digital channel support with intuitive mobile applications. The four applications under NFS™ have been designed and developed for a highly flexible setting and are capable of dealing with multinational, multi-company, multi-asset, multi-lingual, multi-distributor and multi-manufacturer environments. Each application is a complete system in itself and can be used independently to address specific sub-domains of the leasing/financing cycle. When used together, they fully automate the entire leasing/financing cycle for companies of any size, including those with multi-billion-dollar portfolios.
 
NFS Ascent™, the Company’s next generation platform, offers a technologically advanced solution for the auto and equipment finance and leasing industry. NFS Ascent’s™ architecture and user interfaces were designed based on the Company’s collective experience with global Fortune 500 companies over the past 40 years combined with UX design concepts. The platform’s framework allows auto captive and asset finance companies to rapidly transform legacy driven technology into a state-of-the-art IT and business process environment. At the core of the NFS Ascent™ platform is a lease accounting and contract processing engine, which allows for an array of interest calculation methods, as well as robust accounting of multi-billion-dollar lease portfolios in compliance with various regulatory standards. NFS Ascent™, with its distributed and clustered deployment across parallel application and high-volume data servers, enables finance companies to process voluminous data in a hyper speed environment.
 
NFS Ascent™ has been developed using the latest tools and technologies and its n-tier SOA architecture allows the system to greatly improve a myriad of areas including, but not limited to, scalability, performance, fault tolerance and security. We believe that the transition from NFS™ to NFS Ascent™ allows:
 

● | Improvement in overall productivity throughout the delivery organization: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The features of the integrated Business Process Manager, Workflow Engine and Business Rule Engine, will provide flexibility to our clients allowing them to configure certain parts of the application themselves rather than requesting customization. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | The NFS Ascent™ platform and the SOA architecture allow us to develop portals and mobile applications quickly by utilizing our existing services. 
o | The n-tier architecture allows us to intelligently distribute processing and eases application maintenance. The loose coupling between various modules and layers reduces the risk of regression in other parts of the system as a result of changes made in one part of the system and follows proven and accepted SOA principles. 


● | Improvement in talent acquisition and retention: 
--+-----------------------------------------------------


o | Because NFS Ascent™ has been developed using the latest technologies and tools available in the market, it is helping us in attracting and retaining top engineers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Better customer satisfaction: 
--+----------------------------------


o | As a result of the powerful NFS Ascent™ platform and improvement in the talent pool, the quality of our deliverables has increased. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NFS™ and NFS Ascent™ have the following as their constituent applications:
 
Loan Origination System (LOS)
 
Point of Sale (POS)
 
POS is a front office processing system for companies in the financial sector. It provides a quotation system which also incorporates a simulation for all kinds of financial products using a powerful built-in loan calculator.
Credit Application Processing System (CAP)
 
CAP provides companies in the financial sector with an environment to handle the incoming credit applications from dealers, agents, brokers and the direct sales force. CAP automatically gathers information from different interfaces like credit rating agencies, evaluation guides, and contract management systems and gives the applications a score against a user defined point scoring system. This automated workflow permits the credit team members to make their decisions more quickly and accurately. CAP is a database independent online system developed in Microsoft’s .Net framework. It can be run from any computer system with normal specifications, which is a key benefit for clients.
Contract Management System (CMS)
 
CMS provides comprehensive business functionality that enables its users to effectively and smoothly manage and maintain a contract with the most comprehensive details throughout its life cycle. It provides interfaces with external systems such as banks and accounting systems. CMS effectively maintains details of all business partners that do business with the company including, but not limited to, customers, dealers, debtors, guarantors, insurance companies and banks.
Wholesale Finance System (WFS)
 
WFS automates and manages the floor plan/bailment activities of dealerships through a finance company. The design of the system is based on the concept of one asset/one loan to facilitate asset tracking and costing. The system covers credit limit, payment of loan, billing and settlement, stock auditing, online dealer and auditor access, and ultimately the pay-off functions.
Dealer Auditor Access System (DAAS)
 
DAAS is a web-based solution that can be used in conjunction with WFS or any third party wholesale finance system. It addresses the needs of dealer, distributor and auditor access in a wholesale financing arrangement.
Fleet Management System (FMS)
 
FMS is designed to efficiently handle all fleet management needs. FMS is easily integrated with CMS and WFS as well as with any third-party contract management system to ensure a single comprehensive system. FMS key features include: a detailed tracking of information on every driver and vehicle; customizable reports; periodic reporting on fleet related aspects; internet based access to information; integration with third party software; and, linkage to GPS for real time tracking.
 
NFS Digital
 
NFS Digital enables a sales force for a finance and leasing company to access different channels like point of sale, field investigation and auditing as well as allowing end customers to access their contract details through a self-service mobile application.
 
Mobile Account 
 
The powerful mAccount is a self-service mobile solution. It empowers the dealer with a commanding backend system and allows the customer to setup a secured account and view information 24/7 to keep track of contract status, reducing inbound calls for customer queries and improving turnaround time for repayments.

Mobile Point of Sale
 
The application mPOS is a web and mobile enabled platform featuring a customizable home screen dashboard along with multiple quotation, application submission, work queues and detailed reporting to empower dealer networks in making the right decisions at the right time, in turn optimizing productivity.
Mobile Dealer
 
Mobile Platform mDealer provides more visibility and control over inventories – with minimal effort. Dealers can view their use of floor plan facility, stock status and financial conditions, while entering settlement requests or relocating assets.
Mobile Auditor
 
The mAuditor schedules visits, records audit exceptions and tracks assets for higher levels of transparency, in real time.
 
Mobile Field Investigator
 
By using Mobile Field Investigator (mFI), the applicant has access to powerful features that permit detailed verification on the go. The application features a reporting dashboard that displays progress stats, action items and latest notifications, enabling the client to achieve daily goals while tracking performance.
Regional NFS™ Offerings
 
While NFS Ascent™ is designed to be a truly global solution ready for customization in any market, the Company has historically provided products tailored to various markets. As such, we offer the following additional regional products:
 
LeasePak
 
In North America, NetSol Technologies Americas, Inc. (NTA) has and continues to develop the LeasePak CMS product which is now tailored to be an offering on the Microsoft Azure™ cloud. LeasePak streamlines the lease and loan management lifecycle, enabling superior portfolio management, flexible financial products (lease or loan terms) and sophisticated financial analysis and management to reduce operating costs, simply accounting and improve profits. It is scalable from a basic offering to a collection of highly specialized add on modules for systems, portfolios and accounting methods for virtually all sizes and complexity of operations. It is the centerpiece of vehicle leasing infrastructure at leading Fortune 500 banks and Automotive Captives, as well as for some of the industry’s leading independent lessors. It handles every aspect of the lease or loan lifecycle, including credit application origination, credit adjudication, pricing, documentation, booking, payments, customer service, collections, midterm adjustments, and end-of-term options for asset disposition and remarketing.
 
LeasePak Cloud - SaaS
 
NTA also offers the LeasePak Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) business line, which provides high performance with a reduced total cost of ownership. SaaS offers a proven deployment option whereby customers only require access to the internet to use the software. With an elastic cloud price, revenue stream predictability and improved return on investment for customers, management believes that its SaaS customers will experience the performance, the reliability and the speed usually associated with a highly scalable private cloud. LeasePak-SaaS targets small and mid-sized leasing and finance companies.
 
LeaseSoft
 
In addition to offering NFS Ascent™ to the European market, NTE has some regional offerings, including:
 

● | LeaseSoft – a full lifecycle lease and finance system aimed predominantly at the UK funder market, including modules to support web portals and an electronic data interchange manager to facilitate integration between funders and introducers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | LoanSoft – similar to LeaseSoft, but optimized for the consumer loan market.

Implementation Process
 
The implementation process of our products can span from three to eighteen months depending upon the complexity and scope. The implementation process also includes related software services such as configuration, data migration, training and any other additional third-party interfaces. Even after implementation, customers seek enhancements and additions to improve their business processes. NetSol charges these efforts in a man-day rate. Post implementation, NetSol consultants may remain at the client site to assist the customer in smooth operations. After this phase, the regular maintenance and support services phase for the implemented software begins. In addition to the daily rate paid by the customer for each consultant, the customer also pays for all the transportation related expenses, boarding of the consultants, and a living allowance. NetSol’s involvement in all of the above steps is priced to bring value to our customers and increase our profitability from our interactions.
Pricing and Revenue Streams
 
The Company’s revenue streams occur through the following three main areas:
 

● | Product licensing 
--+---------------------------------------------
● | Implementation related services 
● | Maintenance and support related services 

 
License fees in a single market can vary based on relatively low cost for a simple SaaS arrangement to a multi-million dollar fee for multiple module implementations. There are various attributes which determine the level of complexity, a few of which are: number of contracts; size of the portfolio; business strategy of the customer; internal business processes followed by the customer; number of business users; and branch network of the customer. The Company recognizes revenue from license contracts without major customization when a non-cancelable, non-contingent license agreement has been signed, delivery of the software has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. However, revenue from sale of licenses with major customization, modification, and development is recognized on a percentage of completion basis. Implementation related services, including configuration, data migration and third-party interfaces are recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method. Maintenance and support related services are then provided on a continued basis. The annual maintenance fee, which typically is an agreed upon percentage of overall monetary value of the license, then becomes an ongoing revenue stream realized on yearly basis. Revenue from software services includes fixed price contracts and is recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method using the output measure of “Unit of Work Completed.”
 
Joint Ventures
 
NetSol-Innovation
 
In November 2004, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with 1insurer (formerly the Innovation Group) forming NetSol-Innovation (Pvt) Ltd., (“NetSol-Innovation”), a Pakistani company. NetSol-Innovation provides support services enabling 1insurer to scale solution delivery operations in key growth markets. NetSol-Innovation operations are centered in NetSol’s delivery center in Lahore, Pakistan. NetSol owns a majority of the venture. The entities share in the profits of the joint venture on the basis of their shareholding. The outsourcing model between 1insurer and NetSol involves services pertaining to business analyses, configuration, testing, software quality assurance, technical communication, research and development regarding its insurance platform, client support as well as project management for development of software for 1insurer. Beginning in 2016, 1Insurer began to wind down its operations, resulting in a slowdown of outsourcing to NetSol-Innovation. We anticipate that the NetSol-Innovation operations will be absorbed into our Pakistan operations in the near future.
Virtual Lease Services
 
Virtual Lease Services (VLS) is a joint venture partnership with NTE and Investec Bank. NetSol owns a majority of the venture. VLS provides an asset finance services proposition complementing our core solutions offerings. VLS provides three core services, covering business process outsourcing (BPO), provision of standby servicing to the securitization markets, and audit services. The cornerstone of VLS’s range of services is the BPO offering which provides portfolio management to a range of businesses, including start-ups, growth businesses, and those in run down mode. The BPO service also supports portfolio acquirers. VLS carries a Fitch ABS Primary Servicer Rating of “ABPS3+”.

Alliances
 
Daimler South East Asia Pte. Ltd. (“DSEA”), (through the regional office Daimler Financial Services (“DFS”) Africa Asia Pacific), has established a “Centre of Competence” (“CoC”) in Singapore to facilitate the regional companies in NFS™ related matters. The DSEA CoC is powered by highly qualified technical and business personnel. In conjunction with our Asia Pacific region, the CoC supports DFS companies in twelve different countries in Asia and Africa and this list can increase as more DFS companies from other countries opt for NFS Ascent™. In July 2004, the Company entered into a Frame Agreement with DFS for the Asia Pacific and Africa region. This agreement was renewed in 2008, 2010, 2013 and most recently in January 2016. The agreement serves as a guideline for managing the business relationship with DFS and the use of licensed NFSTM products by DFS and its affiliated companies.
Technical Affiliations
 
The Company is a Microsoft Certified Silver Partner and an Oracle Certified Partner.
 
Marketing and Selling
 
NetSol management continues its optimism that the Company will experience ever increasing opportunities for its product and services offerings in 2018 and beyond. The objective of the Company’s marketing program is to create and sustain preference and loyalty for NetSol. Marketing is performed at the corporate and business unit levels. The corporate marketing department has overall responsibility for communications, advertising, public relations and the website. In addition, corporate marketing oversees central marketing and communications programs for use by each of the business units.
 
Our dedicated marketing personnel, within the regions, undertake a variety of marketing activities, including sponsoring focused client events to demonstrate our skills and products, sponsoring and participating in targeted conferences and holding private briefings with individual companies. We believe that the industry focus of our sales professionals and our business unit marketing personnel enhances their knowledge and expertise in these industries and will generate additional client engagements.
 
The Markets 
 
NetSol provides its services primarily to clients in global commercial industries. In the global commercial area, the Company’s service offerings are marketed to clients in a wide array of industries including, automotive, software, banks, higher education and financial services.
 
The Asian continent, including Australia and New Zealand, from the perspective of marketing, are targeted by the Asia Pacific Region from its Bangkok, Beijing and Lahore facilities. The marketing for our core offerings in the Americas and Europe is carried out from our Los Angeles Area and London Metropolitan area offices, respectively.
 
People and Culture
 
The Company believes it has developed a strong corporate culture that is critical to its success. Its key values are delivering world-class quality software, client-focused timely delivery, leadership, long-term relationships, creativity, openness and transparency and professional growth. The services provided by NetSol require proficiency in many fields, such as software engineering, project management, business analysis, technical writing, sales and marketing, and communication and presentation skills.
 
Due to the growing demand for our core offerings and IT services, retention of technical and management personnel is essential. We have enhanced the compensation structure for our technical teams and senior management to stay ahead of global and regional competition. As a result, we have improved IT employee turnover from 22% in 2017 to 14% in 2018 with a goal to improve the turnover level to under 10% during the 2019 fiscal year and onwards. In addition, we are committed to improving key performance indicators such as efficiency, productivity and revenue per employee.
 
To encourage all employees to build on our core values, we reward teamwork and promote individuals that demonstrate these values. We believe that our growth and success are attributable in large part to the high caliber of our employees and our commitment to maintain the values on which our success has been based. We support gender diversity on a global basis. NetSol is an equal opportunity employer with the largest concentration of female employees in Lahore, Pakistan and our U.S. headquarters.

NetSol believes it should give back to the community and employees as much as possible. Certain of our subsidiaries are located in regions where basic services are not readily available. Where possible, NetSol acts to not only improve the quality of life of its employees but also the standard of living in these regions. Examples of such programs are:
 

● | Humanitarian Relief— We are all aware of the devastation that can be wrought by natural disasters. NetSol has historically supported earthquake and flood relief where the need is the greatest. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Literacy Program— launched to educate low paid illiterate employees of the organization. The main objective of this program is to enable these resources to acquire basic reading, writing and arithmetic skills. 
● | Noble Cause Fund—A noble cause fund has been established to meet medical and education expenses of the children of low paid employees. NetSol employees voluntarily contribute a fixed amount every month to the fund and the Company matches the employee subscriptions with an equivalent contribution amount. A portion of this fund is also utilized to support social needs of certain institutions and individuals, outside NetSol. 
● | Day Care Facility—NetSol’s human resources are its key assets and thus the Company takes numerous steps to ensure the provision of basic comforts to its employees. In Pakistan, the provision of outside pre-school child care is a rarity. With this in mind, a child day care facility has been created in close proximity to NetSol offices providing employees with peace of mind knowing their children are nearby and being taken care of by qualified staff in a child friendly facility. 
● | Preventative Health Care Program—In addition to the comprehensive out-patient and in-patient medical benefits, preventive health care has also been introduced. This phased program focuses on vaccination of our employees against such diseases as Hepatitis – A/B, Tetanus, Typhoid and Flu on a routine basis. 

 
There is significant competition for employees with the skills required to perform the services we offer. The Company runs an elaborate training program for different cadre of employees to cover technical skills and business domain knowledge, as well as communication, management and leadership skills. The Company believes that it has been successful in its efforts to attract and retain the highest level of talent available, in part because of the emphasis on core values, training and professional growth. We intend to continue to recruit, hire and promote employees who share our vision.
 
As of June 30, 2018, we had approximately 1,356 employees; comprised of 976 IT project and technical personnel; and 380 non-IT personnel. The IT project and technical personnel include 805 employees dedicated to NFS and NFS Ascent™, 56 employees dedicated to the joint venture with 1insurer and 115 employees supporting the regional offerings as well as IT consulting and services. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
 
Competition 
 
Neither a single company, nor a small number of companies, dominate the IT market in the space in which the Company competes. A substantial number of companies offer services that overlap and are competitive with those offered by NetSol. Some of these are large computer manufacturers and computer consulting firms that have greater financial resources than NetSol and, in some cases, may have greater capacity to perform services similar to those provided by NetSol.
 
In the NFS™ business space, the barriers to entry are getting higher. The products are becoming more cutting-edge while richness in functionality is paramount. Older companies have prolonged the life of their legacy products by creating web-based front ends, while the core of the systems has not been re-engineered. In the case of NFS™, we compete chiefly against leading suppliers of IT solutions to the financial industry, including names such as White Clarke, Cassiopae, LineData, FIS, International Decision Systems (IDS), Data Scan, Alfa, 3i Infotech, Finnone and Nucleus Software.
 
In the IT based business services areas, we compete with both smaller local firms and many global IT services providers, including names such as Wipro, InfoSys, Satyam Infoway, HCL and TCS (Tata Consulting).
 
Many of the competitors of NetSol have longer operating histories, larger client bases, and longer relationships with clients, greater brand or name recognition and significantly greater financial, technical, and public relations resources than NetSol. Existing or future competitors may develop or offer services that are comparable or superior to ours at a lower price, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Global Operations and Geographic Data
 
The Company divides its operations into three regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. The regions consist of individual subsidiaries which operate as autonomous companies and are strategically managed on a regional basis.
The Americas

Mr. Asad Ghauri is the President of Asia Pacific (APAC) and Group Managing Director of Europe. Mr. Ghauri has a long history of experience in the Company, including a tenure as a board of director member, and vast experience in leading our APAC unit.

Asia Pacific Region

The Asia Pacific region including Australia/New Zealand and the Middle East, is targeted from the APAC region offices located in Beijing, China; Bangkok, Thailand; Lahore and Karachi, Pakistan. While Lahore continues to be a mainstay of the Company’s delivery and research and development, Bangkok’s expanded sales operation and client relations facility has grown into a back-up to the Lahore facility. With the continued growth of the Chinese market, our Beijing office continues to expand as both a sales and support facility. Finally, the Asia Pacific region maintains and will establish offices through the region as is necessary to support its customers and to explore potential new markets.
 
Our APAC Region accounted for approximately 79% of our revenues in 2018, and our European and North American regions accounted for approximately 15% and 7%, respectively, of our revenues in 2018.

Pakistani law allows a tax exemption on income from exports of IT services and products up to 2025. While foreign based companies may invest in Pakistan, repatriation of their investment, in the form of dividends or other methods, requires approval of the State Bank of Pakistan.
