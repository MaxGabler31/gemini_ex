Item 1. Business
GENERAL
 Our Company
 We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and intend to qualify annually for such treatment. Our shares are currently listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GARS”. We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our various subsidiaries. We comply with the provisions of the 1940 Act applicable to business development companies, including those governing investment policies, capital structure, leverage, affiliated transactions and the custody of assets, on a consolidated basis with our subsidiaries, including the CLOs. Furthermore, while we are classified as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, we also have the ability to operate as a diversified company to the extent our portfolio meets the definition of diversified as defined in the 1940 Act.

Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital gains through direct loans and debt investments in U.S. based middle-market companies.
 Our Investment Adviser
 Our investment activities are managed by our Investment Adviser. Our Investment Adviser is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research and diligence on prospective investments and equity sponsors, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. Garrison Capital Advisers was organized in November 2010 and is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act. See “Business — Investment Advisory Agreements” for a discussion of the fees that are payable by us to our Investment Adviser.
 Garrison Capital Advisers is an affiliate of Garrison Investment Group. Garrison Capital Advisers has entered into a staffing agreement, or the Staffing Agreement, with Garrison Investment Group. See “Business — Staffing Agreement” for a discussion of the Staffing Agreement. We believe that the Staffing Agreement provides our Investment Adviser with access to investment opportunities, which we refer to in the aggregate as deal flow, generated by Garrison Investment Group in the ordinary course of its business and commits certain Garrison Investment Group employees to serve as members of our investment committee. Garrison Investment Group has conducted due diligence on more than 1,000 middle-market companies since July 2007.
 An affiliate of Garrison Capital Advisers, the Administrator, provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. See “Business — Administration Agreement” for a discussion of the fees and expenses we are required to reimburse to the Administrator.
 Garrison Investment Group
 Garrison Investment Group is an alternative investment and asset management firm founded in March 2007. As of December 31, 2018, Garrison Investment Group had approximately $3.5 billion of committed and invested capital under management and a team of 65 employees, including 34 investment professionals. Garrison Investment Group is headquartered in New York, New York. Garrison Investment Group opportunistically invests in debt and equity, primarily in the areas of corporate finance, real estate finance and structured finance.
 Mr. Joseph Tansey, our chief executive officer and a member of the investment committee of our Investment Adviser, and his team of investment professionals have significant experience being investors and lenders to middle-market companies across a broad range of industries and types of debt over the course of several economic cycles.
 Prior to forming Garrison Investment Group, Mr. Tansey was a Managing Director at Fortress Investment Group LLC, or Fortress, and was also a partner of the Drawbridge Special Opportunities Fund, or Drawbridge, one of Fortress’ hybrid hedge funds, from its inception in August 2002 to March 2007. Drawbridge focused primarily on investments in opportunistic debt and equity securities and asset-based transactions. His responsibilities included sourcing, evaluating, structuring, managing and monitoring corporate, structured finance and real estate investments, including both debt and equity. Mr. Tansey has 24 years of investment experience.
 Our Investment Committee
 All new investments are required to be reviewed by the investment committee of our Investment Adviser, which currently consists of the following members: Joseph Tansey, Brian Chase, Mitch Drucker, Susan George, Robert Chimenti, Joshua Brandt, Allison Adornato and Daniel Hahn. As our Investment Adviser adds senior professionals, our Investment Adviser may add them to its investment committee. The members of the investment committee are employees or partners of Garrison Investment Group and receive no direct compensation from us or our Investment Adviser.

Our Investment Strategy
 Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital gains by generally making investments up to $10.0 million primarily in direct loans and debt securities of U.S. based middle-market companies. We may also selectively make investments in amounts larger than $10.0 million across certain portfolio companies. We generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary based on, among other things, our capital base, the composition of our portfolio, the investment’s risk and other general economic factors. The companies to which we typically extend credit to are moderately leveraged and have been rated below investment grade by national rating agencies. For companies that have not been rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade. In addition, our investments typically range in maturity from one to seven years. However, we may make investments in securities with any maturity or duration.
 We invest opportunistically in middle-market loans and debt securities that we believe have attractive risk adjusted returns. We also, to a lesser extent, may make select minority equity investments (usually in conjunction with a concurrent debt investment) in non-investment grade companies and have acquired a pool of consumer loans. We organize these lending opportunities into three categories. We generally expect the majority of our focus to be on traditional direct lending and purchasing debt investments in the secondary market, which purchases we refer to as capital markets activities. We may also extend credit for certain restructuring of financially troubled companies, which we refer to as special situations. The proportion of these types of investments will change over time given our views on, among other things, the current state of the economic and credit environment. 
 Traditional Direct Lending. We focus on direct origination of first lien senior secured loans (including "unitranche" loans, which are loans that combine the characteristics of both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first lien position). We also may, to a lesser extent, invest in subordinated and mezzanine debt. Our lending opportunities are identified through the extensive origination network to which we have access and serve as either sole lender or as a partner with like-minded creditors. We expect that we will typically extend or participate in floating-rate, first lien secured term loans, the proceeds of which may be used to refinance existing indebtedness or support acquisitions, growth initiatives, general corporate liquidity or operational turnarounds.
 Capital Markets Activities. We also acquire loans in the secondary market, which in certain instances maybe at favorable discounts, or seek to refinance outstanding loans through anchoring or co-anchoring a new issuance of debt. We believe the experience of the investment professionals to whom our Investment Adviser has access allows us to react quickly in executing acquisitions of loans in the secondary market on favorable terms and permits us to refinance loans on a streamlined basis.
 Special Situations. We may also extend credit for out-of-court restructurings, rescue financings, debtor-in-possession financings and acquisition financings. We expect that, in extending credit to special situations borrowers, we will seek to structure our investments to remain high in the borrower’s capital structure, generate returns through the duration of the loan and obtain call protection or opportunities for enhanced returns through equity participation. 
 We expect that, from time to time, and to the extent permissible under the 1940 Act, our investments may include certain non-qualifying assets, including assets of non-U.S. companies, certain publicly traded companies and, to a lesser extent and subject to certain limits under the 1940 Act, registered or unregistered investment companies. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — The constraints imposed on us as a business development company and RIC may hinder the achievement of our investment objectives, and any failure to maintain our status as a business development company or RIC may adversely affect us.” and “Regulation — Qualifying Assets.”
 Our Investment Criteria/Guidelines
 Our target businesses typically exhibit some or all of the following characteristics:
  
• | annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, ranging from $5.0 million to over $50.0 million;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | annual revenue ranging from $75.0 million to over $400.0 million;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

• | a U.S. base of operations;
--+---------------------------


• | an experienced management team executing a long-term growth strategy;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | discernable downside protection through recurring revenue or strong tangible asset coverage;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | defensible niche product/service;
--+----------------------------------


• | products and services with distinctive competitive advantages or other barriers to entry;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | stable and predictable free cash flows;
--+----------------------------------------

--+--------------------------------------------------

 While we believe that the criteria listed above are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies, not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company.
 Our Investment Process
 Due Diligence.   We believe it is critical to conduct extensive due diligence on investment targets and in evaluating new investments. We, through our Investment Adviser, conduct a rigorous due diligence process that draws from our Investment Adviser’s investment experience, industry expertise and network of contacts. Our Investment Adviser conducts extensive due diligence and performs thorough credit analysis on each potential portfolio company investment. In conducting due diligence, our Investment Adviser uses publicly available information and private information provided by borrowers, their financial sponsors and their advisors. Our Investment Adviser uses its relationships with former and current management teams, consultants, competitors and investment bankers to gain further insights into businesses and industries, generally, and our potential portfolio companies, specifically.
 Our due diligence typically includes some of the following elements (although not all elements will necessarily form part of each due diligence review):
  
• | thorough review of historical and prospective financial information, including an analysis of collateral coverage, cash flow and valuation multiples and quality of earnings;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of capital structure, including leverage and equity amounts and participants;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analysis of the business of the prospective portfolio company, including drivers of growth, customer and supplier concentrations, fixed versus variable costs and sensitivity analyses (with a focus on downside scenario analysis);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analysis of the industry in which the prospective portfolio company operates, including its competitive position, industry size and growth rates, competitive outlook, barriers to entry and technological, regulatory and similar considerations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | interviews with management, employees, customers and vendors and analysis of management’s track record, quality, breadth and depth;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation or review of material contracts and loan documents;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | when appropriate, background checks on key managers and research relating to the company’s business, industry, markets, products and services; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | third-party research relating to the company’s management, industry, markets, products and services and competitors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additional due diligence with respect to any investment may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys and independent accountants as well as other outside advisers, as appropriate.

Our Investment Structures
 When our Investment Adviser determines that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, it works with the company’s management and its other capital providers to structure an investment. Our Investment Adviser negotiates among these parties to agree how our investment should be structured relative to the other capital in such company’s capital structure.
 We structure our investments as follows:
 Secured Loans. We typically structure these loans, which include unitranche loans, with either a first or second lien security interest in the portfolio company’s assets that will support the repayment of such loans. Our secured loans generally provide for moderate loan amortization in the early years of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity, but in all cases amortization will be based on the free cash flows generated by the portfolio company and available for debt service. Unitranche loans may also allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term. There is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. In these cases, maturity extension or restructuring may be necessary to preserve collateral and enterprise value. Secured loans may include a payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest feature, although we typically structure loans so that a majority of the interest will be paid in cash.
 Special Situations Loans. These loans may be either secured or unsecured and often support an operational or financial restructuring. These loans may also include situations that require unusual speed to closing or structural flexibility. In some cases we structure these loans as secured debtor-in-possession or bankruptcy exit loans. We seek to obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio company borrowers, which serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. Such collateral may take the form of first-priority or second-priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company borrower. Our special situation loans may provide for moderate loan amortization in the early years of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity, and may include a PIK interest feature, although we expect that a majority of the interest will be paid in cash.
 Warrants and Minority Equity Securities. In some cases, we may receive a minority equity interest in a portfolio company in connection with a loan. These minority equity interests may come in the form of common or preferred equity securities or nominally priced warrants or options to purchase a minority equity interest. As a result, if such a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return. We may also structure warrants to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as a “put,” or right to sell such securities back to the issuer upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and “piggy-back” registration rights.
 We tailor the terms of each investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its operating results. We typically seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by:
  
• | generally limiting investments to less than $10.0 million per transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintaining an emphasis on capital preservation;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | targeting an unlevered annual effective yield on cost between 7% and 11%, excluding any warrants or other equity interests received by us as part of an investment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | making investments which afford us a significant capital cushion in the form of junior capital and/or asset coverage as well as adequate lender protections in loan documentation; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | selecting investments that our Investment Adviser believes have a low probability of loss.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect to hold most of our direct lending investments to maturity or repayment but may sell some investments earlier if liquidity events occur, such as a sale, recapitalization or worsening of the credit quality of the portfolio company.

Managerial Assistance
 As a business development company, we offer, and must provide upon request, significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Garrison Capital Administrator or an affiliate of Garrison Capital Administrator provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. We may receive fees for these services and reimburse Garrison Capital Administrator or an affiliate of Garrison Capital Administrator for its allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to the review and approval by our board of directors, including our independent directors.
Competition
 Our primary competitors who provide financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, including other business development companies, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. As competition for investment opportunities increases, alternate investment vehicles, such as hedge funds and collateralized loan obligations, may invest in middle-market companies. In periods of economic recovery and expansion, we expect that we may face enhanced competition. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a business development company and that the Code imposes on us as a RIC. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — The highly competitive market for investment opportunities in which we operate may limit our investment opportunities.”
Administration
 We do not have any direct employees, and our day-to-day operations are managed by our Investment Adviser. Our officers include a chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, and chief compliance officer. Our officers are employees of Garrison Investment Group, an affiliate of our Investment Adviser, and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs are paid by us pursuant to an administration agreement with the Administrator, or the Administration Agreement. Our executive officers are also officers of Garrison Capital Advisers. See “Business — Administration Agreement.”
Investment Advisory Agreement
 Garrison Capital Advisers is a Delaware limited liability company that is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The principal executive offices of Garrison Capital Advisers are located at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Suite 914, New York, New York 10104.
 Garrison Capital Advisers serves as our investment adviser in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, the Investment Adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment management services to us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, Garrison Capital Advisers:
  
• | determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | closes, monitors and administers the investments we make, including the exercise of any voting or consent rights.

Garrison Capital Advisers’ services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, which was most recently amended and restated on August 14, 2018, we pay Garrison Capital Advisers a fee for investment management services consisting of a management fee and an incentive fee, both of which are described further below.
 Management Fee
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Investment Adviser is entitled to a management fee for its services calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of the average gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed funds, at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters; provided, however, the management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% of the average value of the Company’s gross assets, excluding cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds, that exceeds the product of (i) 200% and (ii) the Company’s average net assets at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters.  For the avoidance of doubt, the 200% is calculated in accordance with the 1940 Act and gives effect to the Company’s exemptive relief with respect to SBIC debentures. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, cash equivalents means U.S. government securities and commercial paper maturing within 270 days of purchase. From May 3, 2017 until August 13, 2018, the management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of the Company’s gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds, and was payable quarterly in arrears. Prior to May 3, 2017, the management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed funds. 
 We made management fee payments to the Investment Adviser of $6.0 million and $5.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Investment Adviser earned management fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement of $6.1 million and $5.9 million, respectively, of which $0.1 million and $0.1 million remained payable as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 Incentive Fee
 The incentive fee consists of two components, the income-based incentive fee and the capital gains-based incentive fee, which are independent of each other (except as provided in the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism described below), with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not.
 Income-Based Incentive Fee.   The first component of the incentive fee, which is income-based, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a catch-up feature and the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism. For this purpose, “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” means interest income, distribution income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, any interest expense and any distributions paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest or original issue discount and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. “Pre Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” does not include any realized capital gains or realized capital losses or unrealized capital gains or losses.
 10

Beginning May 3, 2017, the operation of the first component of the incentive fee for each quarter is as follows:
  
• | no incentive fee is payable to our Investment Adviser in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed a hurdle rate of 1.75% (7.00% annualized), or the “Hurdle Rate”;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 100% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized) is payable to our Investment Adviser. We refer to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than 2.1875%) as the “catch-up.” The effect of the “catch-up” provision is that, if our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter, our Investment Adviser will receive 20% of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if the Hurdle Rate did not apply; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 20% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized) is payable to our Investment Adviser (once the Hurdle Rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Prior to May 3, 2017, the first component of the incentive fee equaled 20.00% of the amount, if any, that our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeded a 2.00% quarterly (8.00% annualized) hurdle rate, subject to a “catch-up” provision measured at the end of each calendar quarter.
 From October 1, 2016 through May 2, 2017, the Investment Adviser, in consultation with our board of directors, irrevocably waived any fees payable to the Investment Adviser under the third amended and restated investment advisory agreement, dated August 5, 2016, with respect to a calendar quarter in excess of the sum of (i) 0.375% per quarter (1.50% annualized) of the gross assets of the Company, excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds, calculated based on the average carrying value of the gross assets of the Company at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, (ii) 20% of pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company’s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, in excess of a “hurdle rate” of 1.75% per quarter (7.00% annualized) and (iii) in the case of the final calendar quarter of each year, the capital gains incentive fee.
 The portion of such incentive fee that is attributable to deferred interest (such as PIK interest or original issue discount) is paid to our Investment Adviser, together with any other interest accrued on the loan from the date of deferral to the date of payment, only if and to the extent we actually receive such interest in cash, and any accrual thereof is reversed if and to the extent such interest is reversed in connection with any write-off or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to any deferred interest accrual. Any reversal of such amounts reduces net income for the quarter by the net amount of the reversal (after taking into account the reversal of incentive fees payable) and results in a reduction and possibly elimination of the incentive fees for such quarter. For the avoidance of doubt, no interest is paid to Garrison Capital Advisers on amounts accrued and not paid in respect of deferred interest.
 There is no accumulation of amounts on the Hurdle Rate from quarter to quarter and, accordingly, there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly Hurdle Rate and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly Hurdle Rate. Since the Hurdle Rate is fixed, as interest rates rise, it will be easier for our Investment Adviser to surpass the Hurdle Rate and receive an incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income.
 Our net investment income used to calculate this component of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the management fee. These calculations are appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable quarter.

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-based component of the incentive fee:
 Quarterly Incentive Fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 
(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets)
 

Percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income allocated to first component of incentive fee
 Capital Gains-Based Incentive Fee.   The second, capital gains component of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date) and equals 20% of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains from April 1, 2013 through the end of each calendar year, computed net of our aggregate cumulative realized and unrealized capital losses through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees and subject to the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism. If such amount is negative, then no capital gains incentive fee is payable for such year. Additionally, if the Investment Advisory Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date is treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the capital gains incentive fee. The capital gains component of the incentive fee is not subject to any minimum return to stockholders. We accrue the capital gains incentive fee if, on a cumulative basis, the sum of net realized gains/(losses) plus net unrealized gains/(losses) is positive.
 Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss. For example, if we receive Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in excess of the Hurdle Rate, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses.
 Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, we are required to accrue a capital gains incentive fee based upon the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital gains and losses on investments held at the end of each period. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then we will record a capital gains incentive fee equal to 20% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains related incentive fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. The Investment Advisory Agreement does not permit unrealized capital gains for purposes of calculating the amount payable to the Investment Adviser. Amounts due related to unrealized capital gains, if any, will not be paid to the Investment Adviser until realized under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement (as described above).
 Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism.   We have structured the calculation of these incentive fees to include a fee limitation, which we refer to collectively as the “Income Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism,” such that no incentive fee will be paid to the Investment Adviser for any fiscal quarter if, after such payment, the cumulative incentive fees paid to the Investment Adviser for the period that includes such fiscal quarter and the 11 full preceding fiscal quarters, which we refer as the “Incentive Fee Look-back Period”, would exceed 20.0% of our Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period.  The deferral component of the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism may cause incentive fees that accrued during one fiscal quarter to be paid to the Investment Adviser at any time during the 11 full fiscal quarters following such initial full fiscal quarter.  The initial Incentive Fee Look-back Period commenced on April 1, 2013 and prior to April 1, 2016, consisted of fewer than 12 full fiscal quarters.
 12

We accomplish this incentive fee limitation by subjecting each incentive fee payable to a cap, which we refer to as the “Incentive Fee Cap”. The Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter is equal to (a) 20.0% of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period less (b) cumulative incentive fees of any kind paid to our Investment Adviser by us during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period. To the extent the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value in any quarter, we will pay no incentive fee to our Investment Adviser in that quarter. We only pay incentive fees to the extent allowed by the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism. To the extent that the payment of incentive fees is limited by the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism, the payment of such fees may be deferred and paid in subsequent quarters up to three years after their date of deferment, subject to applicable limitations included in the Investment Advisory Agreement.
 “Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return” refers to the sum of (a) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined below) for each period during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period and (b) the sum of cumulative realized capital gains, cumulative realized capital losses, cumulative unrealized capital losses and cumulative unrealized capital gains during the applicable Incentive Fee Look-back Period
 Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation
 The following are examples of the calculation of the income-based component of the incentive fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement.
 Example 1: Pre-incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed 1.75% Hurdle Rate
 Assumptions
  
• | Investment income (including interest, distributions, fees, etc.) = 1.25%
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.25%
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hurdle Rate: 1.75%
--+-------------------


• | Management fee = 0.375%
--+------------------------


• | Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 1.25% – (0.375%+ 0.25%) = 0.625%
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate, therefore there is no incentive fee on income.
 Example 2: Pre-incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 1.75% Hurdle Rate but does not exceed 2.1875% “Catch up”
 Assumptions
  
• | Investment income (including interest, distributions, fees, etc.) = 2.50%
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.25%
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hurdle Rate: 1.75%
--+-------------------


• | Management fee = 0.375%
--+------------------------


• | Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.50%– (0.375%+ 0.25%) = 1.875%
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate, therefore there is an incentive fee on income.
 
Incentive fee= (100% × “Catch-Up”) + (the greater of 0% AND (20% × (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income – 2.1875%)))
 Incentive fee= (100.0% x (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income – 1.75%)) + 0%
 Incentive fee= 100.0% x (1.875% - 1.75%)
 Incentive fee= 100.0% x 0.125%
 Incentive fee= 0.125%
 13

Example 3: Pre-incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the Hurdle Rate and Quarterly Catch up 
 Assumptions
  
• | Investment income (including interest, distributions, fees, etc.) = 3.00%
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.25%
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hurdle Rate: 1.75%
--+-------------------


• | Management fee = 0.375%
--+------------------------


• | Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income – (management fee + other expenses)) = 3.00%– (0.375%+ 0.25%) = 2.375%
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate, therefore there is an incentive fee on income.
 
Incentive fee = (100% × “Catch-Up”) + (the greater of 0% AND (20% × (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income – 2.1875%)))
 Incentive fee = (100.0% × “Catch-Up”) + 20% × (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income – 2.1875%)Incentive fee = 100.0% × (2.1875%– 1.75%) + 20% × (2.375%– 2.1875%)Incentive fee = 100.0% × 0.4375% + 20% × 0.1875Incentive fee = 0.475%
 Example of the Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee:
 Example 1:
 Assumptions
  
Year 1: | $20 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), and $30 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”)
--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 2: | Investment A sold for $50 million and fair market value, or FMV, of Investment B determined to be $32 million
--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 3: | FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million
--------+-------------------------------------------------


Year 4: | Investment B sold for $31 million
--------+----------------------------------

 The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be:
  
Year 1: | None
--------+-----


Year 2: | Capital gains incentive fee of $6.0 million ($30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20.0%)
--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 3: | None; $5.0 million (20.0% multiplied by ($30 million cumulative capital gains less $5 million cumulative capital loss)) less $6.0 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2)
--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 4: | Capital gains incentive fee of $200,000; $6.2 million ($31 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20.0%) less $6.0 million (capital gains fee paid in Year 2)
--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 2:
 Assumptions
  
Year 1: | $20 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), $30 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”) and $25 million investment made in Company C (“Investment C”)
--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 2: | Investment A sold for $50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25 million
--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 3: | FMV of Investment B determined to be $27 million and Investment C sold for $30 million
--------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 4: | FMV of Investment B determined to be $35 million
--------+-------------------------------------------------


Year 5: | Investment B sold for $20 million
--------+----------------------------------

 The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be:
  
Year 1: | None
--------+-----

 14

 
Year 2: | Capital gains incentive fee of $5.0 million; 20.0% multiplied by $25 million ($30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less $5 million unrealized capital loss on Investment B)
--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 3: | Capital gains incentive fee of $1.4 million; $6.4 million (20.0% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3 million unrealized capital loss on Investment B)) less $5.0 million (capital gains fee received in Year 2)
--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 4: | None
--------+-----


Year 5: | None; $5.0 million of capital gains incentive fee (20.0% multiplied by $25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35 million less realized capital losses of $10 million)) less $6.4 million (cumulative capital gains fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3)(1)
--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(1) | The cumulative aggregate capital gains fee received by Garrison Capital Advisers in this hypothetical example ($6.4 million) may be effectively greater than 20.0% of cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less net realized capital losses and aggregate cumulative net unrealized capital loss ($5.0 million).
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Example of the Application of the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism:
 Assumptions
  
• | In each of Years 1 through 4 in this example, as well as in each preceding year from the date of our initial public offering, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income equals $40.0 million per year, which we recognized evenly in each quarter of each year and paid quarterly. This amount exceeds the hurdle rate and the requirement of the “catch-up” provision in each quarter of such year. As a result, the annual income related portion of the incentive fee, before the application of the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism in any year is $8.0 million ($40.0 million multiplied by 20%), and the cumulative income related portion of the incentive fee before the application of the incentive fee cap and deferral mechanism over any Incentive Fee Look-back Period is $24 million ($8.0 million multiplied by three). All income-related incentive fees were paid quarterly in arrears.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In each year preceding Year 1, we did not generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses, no capital gain-related incentive fee was paid and there was no deferral of incentive fees.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 1: | We did not generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses
--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 2: | We realized a $30.0 million capital gain and did not otherwise generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses
--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 3: | We recognized a $5.0 million unrealized capital loss and did not otherwise generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses
--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Year 4: | We realized a $6.0 million capital gain and did not otherwise generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses
--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------+-----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Year 4 | $8.0 million($40.0 million multiplied by 20%) | $0.2 million (20% of cumulative net capital gains of $31.0 million ($36.0 million cumulative realized capital gains less $5.0 million cumulative unrealized capital loss) less $6.0 million of capital gains fee paid in Year 2) | $9.2 million (20% of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return during Incentive Fee Look-back Period of $151.0 million ($120.0 million plus $31.0 million) less $21.0 million of cumulative incentive fees paid) | Incentive fees of $9.2 million paid ($8.2 million of incentive fees accrued in Year 4 plus $1.0 million of deferred incentive fees); no incentive fees 

 As of December 31, 2018, without giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism, the Investment Adviser had calculated an aggregate of $10.9 million of income-based incentive fees since January 1, 2016 (the Incentive Fee Look-back Period), of which zero has been paid as of December 31, 2018. However, the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return has been decreased by the aggregate cumulative net realized and unrealized capital losses, as calculated under U.S. GAAP, experienced through the Incentive Fee Look-back Period. Furthermore, no incentive fee will be paid to the Investment Adviser for any fiscal quarter if, after such payment, the cumulative incentive fees paid to our Investment Adviser for the Incentive Fee Look-back Period would exceed 20% of our Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return during the applicable Incentive Fee Look-back Period. As a result, as of December 31, 2018, aggregate incentive fees payable to the Investment Adviser during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period were capped by the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism at $0.1 million (i.e., 20% of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period).
 To the extent unrealized capital losses incurred as of December 31, 2018 are reversed or cease to impact the Incentive Fee Cap within the applicable Incentive Fee Look-back Period, the corresponding increase in our Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return may result in the Investment Adviser earning and being paid up to $10.8 million of income based incentive fees which are currently subject to the Incentive Fee Cap. 
 Realized and unrealized capital gains and losses and Pre-Incentive Net Investment Income earned during the three months ended December 31, 2018 will cease to impact the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral after December 31, 2021.
 17

The Investment Adviser earned aggregate incentive fees of $2.7 million, $2.8 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, $0.1 million of the incentive fees earned were payable on the consolidated statements of financial condition as a result of, and subject to, the Incentive Fee Cap. None of the incentive fees earned were payable on the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2017 as a result of the Incentive Fee Cap.
 Payment of Our Expenses
 All investment professionals of the Investment Adviser and their respective staffs when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, are provided and paid for by our Administrator. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — Expenses.”
Duration and Termination
 The Investment Advisory Agreement was most recently approved by our board of directors, including a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of us or Garrison Capital Advisers, in February 2018. Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will continue in effect from year to year if approved annually by our board of directors, or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of Garrison Capital. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days’ written notice to the other. Any termination by us must be authorized either by our board of directors or by vote of our stockholders. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — We depend upon key personnel of Garrison Investment Group and its affiliates.”
 Limitation of Liability and Indemnification
 The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that Garrison Capital Advisers and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and affiliates are not liable to us for any act or omission by it in connection with its duties or obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our Investment Adviser, except that the foregoing exculpation does not extend to any act or omission constituting willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its duties or obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Investment Advisory Agreement also provides for indemnification by us of Garrison Capital Advisers and its managers, partners, officers, employees, agents, controlling persons, members and affiliates for damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) incurred by them in or by reason of any pending, threatened or completed action, suit, investigation or other proceeding (including an action or suit by us or our stockholders or in our or our stockholders’ right) arising out of or based on Garrison Capital Advisers’ duties or obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our Investment Adviser, subject to the same limitations and conditions.
 Board of Directors Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement
 Our board of directors determined at a meeting held in February 2019 to approve the renewal of the Investment Advisory Agreement. In its consideration of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the board of directors focused on information it had received relating to, among other things:

• | the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by the Investment Adviser;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our investment performance and that of our Investment Adviser;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | the costs of providing services to us;
--+---------------------------------------


• | the profitability of the relationship between us and our Investment Adviser;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | comparative information on fees and expenses borne by other comparable business development companies or registered investment companies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18

 
• | comparative business development companies or registered investment companies’ performance and other competitive factors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as we grow; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | whether fee levels reflect these economies of scale, if any, for the benefit of our stockholder.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on the information reviewed and the considerations detailed above, the board of directors, including all of the directors who are not “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, of us or Garrison Capital Advisers, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates and terms are fair and reasonable in relation to the services provided and approved the Investment Advisory Agreement, as well as the Administration Agreement, as being in the best interests of our stockholders.
 Administration Agreement
 Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, most recently approved by our board of directors in February 2018, Garrison Capital Administrator furnishes us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator also performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records which are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Administrator assists in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. In addition, the Administrator also provides managerial assistance on our behalf to those portfolio companies that have accepted our offer to provide such assistance. Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator’s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party. The Administrator may retain third parties to assist in providing administrative services to us. To the extent that our Administrator outsources any of its functions we pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without any profit to the Administrator.
 Limitation of Liability and Indemnification
 The Administration Agreement provides that Garrison Capital Administrator and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and affiliates are not liable to us or any of our stockholders for any act or omission by it or such other persons or entities in connection with its duties or obligations under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as our Administrator, except that the foregoing exculpation does not extend to any act or omission constituting willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its duties or obligations under the Administration Agreement. The Administration Agreement also provides for indemnification by us of Garrison Capital Administrator and its managers, partners, officers, employees, agents, controlling persons, members and affiliates for damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) incurred by them in or by reason of any pending, threatened or completed action, suit, investigation or other proceeding (including an action or suit by us or our stockholders or in our or our stockholders’ right) arising out of or otherwise based on Garrison Capital Administrator’s duties or obligations under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as our Administrator, subject to the same limitations and conditions.
 19

License Agreement
 We have entered into a license agreement, or the License Agreement, with Garrison Investment Group pursuant to which Garrison Investment Group has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name “Garrison.” Under the License Agreement, we will have a right to use the Garrison name, for so long as Garrison Capital Advisers or one of its affiliates remains our Investment Adviser. The License Agreement is terminable by either party at any time in its sole discretion upon 60 days prior written notice and is also terminable by Garrison Investment Group in the case of certain events of non-compliance. Other than with respect to this limited license, we will have no legal right to the “Garrison” name.
Staffing Agreement
 We do not have any internal management capacity or employees. We depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the senior investment professionals of Garrison Capital Advisers to achieve our investment objective. Garrison Capital Advisers is an affiliate of Garrison Investment Group and depends upon access to the investment professionals and other resources of Garrison Investment Group and its affiliates to fulfill its obligations to us under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Garrison Capital Advisers also depends upon Garrison Investment Group to obtain access to deal flow generated by the professionals of Garrison Investment Group and its affiliates. Under the Staffing Agreement, Garrison Investment Group provides Garrison Capital Advisers with the resources necessary to fulfill these obligations. The Staffing Agreement provides that Garrison Investment Group will make available to Garrison Capital Advisers experienced investment professionals and access to the senior investment personnel of Garrison Investment Group for purposes of evaluating, negotiating, structuring, closing and monitoring our investments. The Staffing Agreement also includes a commitment that the members of Garrison Capital Advisers’ investment committee serve in such capacity. The Staffing Agreement remains in effect until terminated and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party. Services under the Staffing Agreement are provided to Garrison Capital Advisers on a direct cost reimbursement basis, and such fees are not our obligation.

 REGULATION
 General
 We have elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act and have elected be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and intend to qualify annually for such treatment. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between business development companies and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors of a business development company be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a business development company unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities.
 20

Our board of directors may decide to issue common stock to finance our operations rather than issuing debt or other senior securities. As a business development company, we are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below current net asset value per share. We may, however, issue or sell our common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock, or sell warrants, options or rights to acquire such common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock, if our board of directors determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, and if our stockholders approve such sale within the preceding 12 months. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount).
 We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an “underwriter” as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than three percent of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than five percent of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to an additional layer of expenses. None of these policies is fundamental, and all may be changed without stockholder approval.
 Qualifying Assets
 Under the 1940 Act, a business development company may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following:

(1) | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(a) | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company, or SBIC, wholly owned by the business development company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | satisfies any of the following:
----+--------------------------------


• | does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or has any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange subject to a $250.0 million market capitalization maximum; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | is controlled by a business development company or a group of companies including a business development company, the business development company actually exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the eligible portfolio company, and, as a result, the business development company has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21

 
(2) | Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or other high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The regulations defining and interpreting qualifying assets may change over time. We expect to adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area.
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
 In addition, a business development company must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the business development company must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the business development company, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.

Temporary Investments
 Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or other high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or may invest in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. Government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Investment Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. See “– Taxation as a RIC” for a definition of “Diversification Tests.”
Senior Securities
 We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. Prior to August 15, 2018, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, was at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratio at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We consolidate our financial results with those of the CLOs, GLC Trust 2013-2, the GARS Equity Holdings Entities, Walnut Hill II LLC, Forest Park II LLC, Garrison Capital PL Holdings LLC and Garrison SBIC for financial reporting purposes and measure our compliance with the leverage test applicable to business development companies under the 1940 Act on a consolidated basis. On September 30, 2014, we received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of Garrison SBIC subsidiary from our asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. As such, our ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness may be less than 150%. This provides us with increased investment flexibility but also increases our risks related to leverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — Regulations governing our operation as a business development company, including those related to the issuance of senior securities, will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional debt or equity capital.”
 23

Code of Ethics
 We and Garrison Capital Advisers have adopted a joint code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. You may read and copy the joint code of ethics at the SEC’s Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (202) 551-8090. In addition, the joint code of ethics is attached as an exhibit to the registration statement, and is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov . You may also obtain copies of the joint code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SEC’s Public Reference Section, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Investment Adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of our Investment Adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by our Investment Adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures described below, “we” “our” and “us” refers to our Investment Adviser.
 Introduction. As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, we have a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of our clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients.
 These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
 Proxy Policies. We vote proxies relating to our clients’ portfolio securities in what we perceive to be the best interest of our clients’ shareholders. We review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a shareholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by our clients. In most cases, we will vote in favor of proposals that we believe are likely to increase the value of our clients’ portfolio securities. Although we will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our clients’ portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so.
 Our proxy voting decisions are made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our clients’ investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. Where conflicts of interest may be present, we will disclose such conflicts, including to Garrison Investment Group, and may request guidance on how to vote such proxies.
 Proxy Voting Records. You may obtain information without charge about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Investor Relations, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Suite 914, New York, New York 10104 or by calling us collect at (212) 372-9590.

Privacy Principles
 We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties.
 Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third party administrator).
 We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to employees of our Investment Adviser and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We will maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders.
 Other
 Under the 1940 Act, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a business development company, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office. We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
 We and the Investment Adviser are each required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the U.S. federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures.
 25

We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates, including the Investment Adviser, without the prior approval of our board of directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The SEC has interpreted the prohibition on transactions by business development companies with affiliates to prohibit “joint” transactions among entities that share a common Investment Adviser. The staff of the SEC has granted no-action relief permitting purchases of a single class of privately placed securities provided that the adviser negotiates no term other than price and certain other conditions are met. Except in certain limited circumstances, we will be unable to invest in any issuer in which another account sponsored or managed by our Investment Adviser has previously invested.
 On January 12, 2015, we and the Investment Adviser and other affiliates received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit greater flexibility to negotiate the terms of co-investments because we believe that it will be advantageous for us to co-invest with accounts sponsored or managed by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates where such investment is consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions, as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. We may also co-invest alongside other accounts sponsored or managed by our Investment Adviser and its affiliates as otherwise permissible under SEC staff guidance and interpretations, applicable regulations and the allocation policy of the Investment Adviser. We believe that co-investment by us and accounts sponsored or managed by the Investment Adviser may afford us additional investment opportunities and the ability to achieve greater diversification.
 Under the terms of our exemptive relief, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors is required to make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment strategies and policies.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:
  
• | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which must be audited by our independent registered public accounting firm; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance with that act.

Small Business Investment Company Regulations
 SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBIC regulations, SBICs may make loans to certain eligible small businesses, invest in the equity securities of such businesses and provide them with consulting and advisory services.
 The Small Business Administration, or SBA, prohibits an SBIC from providing funds to small businesses for certain purposes, such as relending or investing outside the United States, to businesses engaged in a few prohibited industries, and to certain “passive” (i.e., non-operating) companies. In addition, without prior SBA approval, a SBIC may not invest an amount equal to more than approximately 30% of the SBIC’s regulatory capital in any one company and its affiliates.
 The SBA places certain limitations on the financing terms of investments by SBICs in portfolio companies (such as limiting the permissible interest rate on debt securities held by a SBIC in a portfolio company). Regulations adopted by the SBA allow a SBIC to exercise control over a small business for a period of up to seven years from the date on which the SBIC initially acquires its control position. This control period may be extended for an additional period of time with the SBA’s prior written approval.
 An SBIC (or group of SBICs under common control) may generally have outstanding debentures guaranteed by the SBA in amounts up to twice the amount of the privately raised funds of the SBIC(s). Debentures guaranteed by the SBA have a maturity of ten years, require semi-annual payments of interest and do not require any principal payments prior to maturity.
 Currently, the maximum amount of combined leverage for affiliated SBIC funds is $350.0 million, with a single SBIC using up to $175.0 million in leverage.
 SBICs must invest idle funds that are not being used to make loans in investments permitted under SBIC regulations in the following limited types of securities: (1) direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, which mature within 15 months from the date of the investment; (2) repurchase agreements with federally insured institutions with a maturity of seven days or less (and the securities underlying the repurchase obligations must be direct obligations of or guaranteed by the U.S. federal government); (3) certificates of deposit with a maturity of one year or less, issued by a federally insured institution; (4) a deposit account in a federally insured institution that is subject to a withdrawal restriction of one year or less; (5) a checking account in a federally insured institution; or (6) a reasonable petty cash fund.
 Neither the SBA nor the U.S. government or any of its agencies or officers has approved any ownership interest to be issued by us or any obligation that we or any of our subsidiaries may incur.
 27

Election to Be Taxed as a RIC
 As a business development company, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and intend to qualify annually for such treatment. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, an amount at least equal to 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, or the Annual Distribution Requirement.
 Taxation as a RIC
 If we:
  
• | qualify as a RIC; and
--+----------------------


• | satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement;
--+---------------------------------------------

 then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and our “net capital gain” (which is our net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses) that we distribute to stockholders. If we don’t distribute all of our investment company taxable income and net capital gains, we will be subject to U.S. federal tax at the regular corporate tax rates on the net income or net capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders, and may also be subject to a 4% excise tax on such amounts, as described below. We may choose to retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, and pay the associated U.S. federal corporate income tax, including the U.S. federal excise tax described below.
 We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on our undistributed net capital gains and net income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year, less certain over-distributions in prior years, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate income tax in the taxable year ending within the relevant calendar year will be treated as distributed.
 In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
  
• | qualify to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, and net income derived from interests in “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive 90% of their income from interest, dividends and other permitted RIC income), or the 90% Income Test; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | diversify our holdings, or the Diversification Tests, so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 28

We may invest in partnerships, including qualified publicly traded partnerships, which may result in our being subject to state, local or foreign income, franchise or withholding liabilities.
 Any underwriting fees paid by us are not deductible. We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.
 Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (1) treat dividends that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income as non-qualified dividend income, (2) treat dividends that would otherwise be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction as ineligible for such treatment, (3) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (4) convert lower-taxed long-term capital gain into higher-taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (5) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (6) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (7) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (8) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (9) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We intend to monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the effect of these provisions and prevent our disqualification as a RIC.
 Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long term or short term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.
 Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. See “Regulation — Senior Securities.” Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our qualification as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
 We generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Investments in these types of instruments may present special tax issues for us. U.S. federal income tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when we may cease to accrue interest, original issue discount or market discount, when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless instruments, how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income and whether exchanges of debt obligations in a bankruptcy or workout context are taxable. These and other issues will be addressed by us to the extent necessary in order to seek to ensure that we distribute sufficient income such that we do not become subject to U.S. federal income or excise tax.
 Some of the income and fees that we may recognize will not satisfy the 90% Income Test. In order to ensure that such income and fees do not disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may be required to recognize such income and fees indirectly through one or more entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations will be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees.
 29

Failure to Qualify as a RIC
 If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and are unable to cure the failure, for example, by disposing of certain investments quickly or raising additional capital to prevent the loss of RIC status, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at the regular corporate rate. The Code provides some relief from RIC disqualification due to failures of the source of income and asset diversification requirements, although there may be additional taxes due in such cases. We cannot assure you that we would qualify for any such relief should we fail the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests.
 Should failure occur not only would all our taxable income be subject to tax at regular corporate rates (and subject to any applicable state or local corporate income taxes), we would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would distributions be required to be made. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate stockholders would be eligible to claim a dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, and non-corporate stockholders would generally be able to treat such dividends as “qualified dividend income,” which is subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. If we were to fail to meet the RIC requirements for more than two consecutive years and then seek to requalify as a RIC, we would be required to recognize gain to the extent of any unrealized appreciation in our assets unless we make a special election to pay corporate level tax on the unrealized appreciation recognized during the succeeding five-year period.
