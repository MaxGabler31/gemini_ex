Item 1. Business
General
We provide comprehensive intelligence-based cybersecurity solutions that allow organizations to prepare for, prevent, investigate, respond to and remediate cyber attacks. Our portfolio of cybersecurity products and services is designed to minimize the risk of costly cyber security breaches by detecting and preventing advanced, targeted and other evasive attacks, as well as enabling more efficient management of security operations, including alert management, investigation and response when a breach occurs. We accomplish this through the integration of our core competitive advantages in solutions and services that adapt to changes in the threat environment through a cycle of intelligence-driven innovation. Our core competitive advantages include:

• | Our technologies, including our machine-learning, behavioral-based, and rules-based threat detection, analysis and correlation technologies, combined with our proprietary Multi-vector Virtual Execution ("MVX") engine,


• | Our intelligence on threats and threat actors based on the continuous flow of machine-, attacker- and victim-based attack data from our global network of threat sensors and virtual machines, as well as threat intelligence gathered by our security analysts, consultants and incident responders, and


• | Our accumulated security expertise derived from responding to thousands of significant breaches over the past decade.

Our threat detection and prevention products encompass appliance-based, virtual and cloud solutions for web security, email security and endpoint security. These products are complemented by our cloud-based threat intelligence, security analytics and security automation and orchestration technologies, as well as our managed security services, cybersecurity consulting and incident response offerings. In combination, our solutions and services enable a proactive approach to cybersecurity that extends across the threat management lifecycle to minimize the risk of costly cybersecurity breaches.
We have organized our cybersecurity solutions in a hub and spokes model designed to integrate machine-generated threat data from our detection and prevention products with our analytics, response and orchestration technologies delivered through our Helix cybersecurity operations platform. Helix is designed to enable more efficient security operations by correlating security and event data across an organization’s environment to determine which threats present the greatest risk, automating repetitive security processes, and providing tools and workflows to investigate alerts and respond to attacks. The Helix cloud-based interface presents a unified view of an organization’s attack surface, including on-premise and cloud environments, and provides the contextual threat intelligence and threat management tools to enable a rapid response.
We were founded in 2004 to address the inability of signature-based security solutions to detect the new generation of dynamic, stealthy and targeted cyber attacks, known as advanced persistent threats. To meet the challenges of detecting these previously unknown threats, for which there were no signatures, we developed our MVX engine, a purpose-built virtual machine-based threat detection and analysis engine. MVX works in conjunction with our intelligence-driven analysis ("IDA") technologies in our network, email and endpoint security solutions to detect and block attacks that evade detection by signature-based security solutions. Our approach allows us to detect both known and unknown threats while minimizing costly false positive alerts. In addition to providing customers with high fidelity alerts on cyber attacks, MVX generates a continuous flow of real-time, anonymized “victim-based” threat data to FireEye through our Dynamic Threat Intelligence ("DTI") cloud.
In December 2013, we acquired Mandiant, a leading provider of advanced endpoint security products and security incident response management solutions. As a result of the Mandiant acquisition, we expanded our threat intelligence to include contextual information on cyber attackers’ tools and techniques, augmented our threat detection technologies with additional detection and forensic capabilities, and added a comprehensive suite of incident response and other cyber related professional services.
Since the Mandiant acquisition, we have expanded our business from a narrow focus on the detection of advanced persistent threats to helping our customers detect and prevent all types of cyber attacks and improve their resilience to new cyber threats using our technologies, intelligence and expertise. Additionally, our threat researchers correlate the attack data from our network, email, and endpoint security solutions with the intelligence on adversaries generated by our global network of security researchers and consultants. This deep knowledge of the threat environment and attacker tools and techniques is used to adapt our detection and analysis engines to new attack techniques and to develop new features and use cases for our security solutions.
In the first quarter of 2017, we introduced our FireEye Helix cybersecurity operations platform. Helix integrates security alerts from our network, email and endpoint security solutions, as well as data from other information technology and cybersecurity solutions, with our advanced threat intelligence, threat analytics, and orchestration capabilities to enable more efficient security operations. The cloud-based Helix user interface provides a unified, customized view of an organization’s attack surface, and includes pre-determined threat response “playbooks” based on Mandiant expertise and best practices. Helix allows security analysts to prioritize critical alerts, hunt for new threats, and rapidly pivot from detection to response to reduce the business impact of an attack.
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 7,700 end-customers, including more than 50% of the Forbes Global 2000. Our customers include leading enterprises in a diverse set of industries, including telecommunications, technology, financial services, public utilities, healthcare and oil and gas, as well as leading U.S. and international governmental agencies.
For 2018, 2017 and 2016, our revenue was $831.0 million, $779.6 million and $706.0 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 7% for 2018 and 10% for 2017, and our net losses were $243.1 million, $285.2 million and $485.4 million, respectively.

All our detection and prevention solutions include subscriptions to our DTI cloud and support offerings, which are priced either as a percentage of the appliance hardware or as an all-inclusive subscription. Subscriptions are typically offered for one- or three-year terms. We typically invoice customers for the full term of subscriptions up-front. Our Helix cybersecurity platform, threat analytics, and Managed Defense security-as-a-service offerings are offered in one- or three-year subscriptions and are priced based on appropriate use metrics. These subscriptions are invoiced either for the full term of the subscription up front or annually, based on customer preference. Professional services are invoiced according to pre-determined contract terms for consulting services and on a time-and-materials basis for incident response. We recognize professional services revenue as our services are delivered.
Product, Subscription and Support
Threat Detection and Prevention Solutions. Our detection and prevention solutions utilize our advanced threat detection software, including our IDA technologies and MVX engine, to identify suspicious content embedded in Internet and network traffic, emails, software downloads and other data transfers and electronic communications. Our portfolio encompasses solutions for network security, email security, and endpoint security that are available in a variety of form factors and deployment options.

• | Network security solutions. Our network security solutions utilize our IDA technologies and MVX engine in a two-phase approach to detect, validate and block advanced, targeted and other evasive attacks hidden in Internet traffic, as well as threats embedded in internal network traffic. Our network security solutions may be deployed at the network perimeter, in conjunction with signature- and policy-based defenses, such as network firewalls to detect and validate attacks missed by those products. Additionally, our network security solutions may be deployed at the network core, across network segments or in front of servers to detect threats embedded in internal network traffic, such as ransomware. Our network security solutions require up-to-date dynamic threat intelligence and software support to maintain high detection efficacy. Customers may choose to purchase our network security software, dynamic threat intelligence, and support in a single “all inclusive” subscription, with optional appliance hardware, or they may purchase pre-configured appliance hardware with the required dynamic threat intelligence and support subscriptions priced as a percentage of the appliance hardware. Our network security solutions integrate with our email and endpoint security solutions through our Central Management System ("CMS") or our Helix security operations platform to correlate threat intelligence and protect against multi-vector, blended attacks.

Integrated network security. Our integrated network security appliances combine our IDA rules and correlation engines and our MVX engine in a single, standalone appliance to secure a single Internet access point. Customers may choose to deploy integrated network security on our optimized appliance hardware, or on a virtual appliance, with capacity scaling from 50 megabits per second to multiple gigabits per second of throughput.
Distributed network security. In November 2016, we updated our advanced detection software to enable our IDA detection technologies to be deployed separately from our MVX engine without performance degradation. This allowed our IDA technologies to be deployed at multiple Internet access points in distributed, cloud and hybrid environments, using physical or virtual appliances known as Smart Nodes. Suspicious traffic detected by network sensors is submitted to a centrally shared MVX 
service over an encrypted connection. Distributed network security customers can choose to host the shared MVX service in their private cloud or utilize the FireEye-hosted Cloud MVX service.
Network forensics. Our network forensics appliances capture, store and index full network packets at rapid speeds to allow organizations to investigate and resolve security incidents.

• | Email security solutions. Our email security solutions detect and stop spear phishing, ransomware, sender impersonation, credential phishing, typo-squatting, and other email-based attacks. We offer our email security solution in a Server Edition with multiple deployment options, or as a cloud-based service. Both versions utilize our URL detection platform and our MVX engine to inspect emails for zero-day exploits, malicious URLs, behavioral anomalies, and other malware hidden in attachments. If an attack is confirmed, the malicious email is quarantined for further analysis and deletion. Our email security solutions integrate with FireEye network security through our CMS or our Helix security operations platform to protect against multi-vector, blended attacks.

Email Security - Server Edition is an on-premises appliance-based solution that can be deployed with an integrated MVX engine or in a distributed architecture with a centralized, private cloud MVX service. 
Email Security - Cloud Edition is a FireEye-hosted version of our email security solution designed to integrate with cloud-based email systems such as Microsoft Office 365 with Exchange Online Protection and Google Mail. Email Security - Cloud Edition provides the same advanced correlation, analytics and MVX threat validation as Email Security - Server Edition, and also includes anti-spam and antivirus protection to defend against conventional signature-based threats.

• | Endpoint security solutions. Our endpoint security solutions consist of a centralized management application, available through an on-premise appliance or as a cloud-based user interface, and lightweight endpoint agents deployed on desktops, laptops and other end-user devices. The solutions combine a signature-based endpoint protection platform with advanced endpoint detection and response capabilities to provide a comprehensive detection, protection and response solution in a single endpoint agent. The endpoint security agent also enables rapid containment and collects forensic data necessary for post-breach investigation and analysis of attacks. Our endpoint security solutions integrate with our email and endpoint security solutions through our CMS or our Helix security operations platform to correlate threat intelligence and protect against multi-vector, blended attacks.


• | Customer Support and Maintenance Services. We offer technical support on our solutions. We provide multiple levels of support and have regional support centers located across the globe to help customers solve technical challenges they may encounter. In addition to post-sales support activities, our support organization works with our product management and engineering teams to ensure the attainment of defined pre-requisite quality levels for our products and services prior to release.

Security Orchestration, Analytics and Management Solutions

• | Central Management System. Our Central Management System manages the overall deployment and integration of our on-premise network, email and endpoint security solutions by unifying reporting, configuration, and threat intelligence sharing. Customers generally purchase one or more CMS appliances to manage multiple FireEye detection and prevention appliances.

Our FireEye Security Orchestrator ("FSO") accelerates and simplifies security operations by coordinating the response to critical alerts across the security and IT infrastructure using customized workflows, granular permissions, and bi-directional command and control plug-ins for many popular security and infrastructure products. FSO also provides an investigative dashboard and is a core enabling technology for the Helix cybersecurity platform.


• | FireEye Helix. Our FireEye Helix security operations platform combines security alerts generated by our network, email and endpoint security solutions, as well as third-party security and IT products, with our contextual threat intelligence, threat analytics, and orchestration capabilities within a unified cloud-based interface. Helix enriches raw security event data with our contextual threat intelligence and our built-in analytics to identify and prioritize critical alerts. Helix also serves as an investigative platform with case management and workflow tools, as well as pre-loaded playbooks to automate and orchestrate the response across an organization. Helix also provides detailed reporting for compliance purposes.

Threat Intelligence Subscriptions

• | Dynamic Threat Intelligence Cloud. Our DTI cloud is a bi-directional cloud-based service that collects, correlates and anonymizes machine-generated security data from our network, email and endpoint security solutions. DTI also distributes updated threat detection and prevention algorithms and software updates to our network, email and endpoint security solutions based on new threat intelligence and an evolving attack landscape. A subscription to our DTI cloud is required for all network, email and endpoint security solutions.


• | FireEye Threat Intelligence is a subscription service based on our active monitoring of attacker personas, including nation-state sponsored groups. The resulting intelligence on adversaries is codified in reports and distributed through our Threat Intelligence portal to enable organizations to proactively defend against new and emerging cyber threats before an attack is launched.

On-Demand and Managed Service Subscriptions

• | Managed Defense is a technology-enabled managed detection and response service that utilizes our latest adversary, machine-based, and victim threat intelligence to detect, investigate, and proactively hunt for known and previously undetected threats in our customers' environments.

Our Technologies
We have developed proprietary technologies related to threat detection, virtual machine-based threat analysis, endpoint protection, and security orchestration. Our technologies leverage intelligence about threat actors’ tools and techniques, gathered through our incident response engagements and our network of security researchers, to adapt to new threats and changes in the threat environment. We believe these technologies, combined with our threat intelligence and security expertise, differentiate our products and services.
Advanced Threat Detection and Prevention Technologies. At the core of our detection and protection capabilities for our network, email and endpoint security solutions is our proprietary, purpose-built MVX engine and our IDA technologies. Our IDA technologies include advanced correlation and analytics engines, our MalwareGuard machine-learning detection engine, behavior- and rules-based detection modules, and signature matching capabilities. These detection technologies work in conjunction with our MVX engine and our Helix-based analytics to detect suspicious content and confirm malicious behavior in the targeted virtual environment. This allows our network, email and endpoint security solutions to provide high fidelity detection of known and unknown threats with negligible false-positive rates. We have built our IDA and MVX engine technologies over 10 years of research and development, and we believe they represent a significant competitive advantage for us. They first identify suspicious flows using intelligence-driven rules and analysis, including machine-learning and behavioral analysis, and then, through a separate process, use our MVX engine to determine whether such suspicious flows are malicious. Our detection technologies can be deployed on a single integrated appliance, as a cloud-based service, or in a hybrid appliance/cloud architecture.
Advanced Endpoint Validation and Containment. Our endpoint security solution includes proprietary technologies that enable (i) automatic creation of indicators of compromise coupled with rapid enterprise-wide search, (ii) exploit detection and prevention, (iii) malware detection and prevention, (iv) forensic data capture and (v) rapid containment and investigation for connected and unconnected endpoints. Additionally, we have developed our endpoint technologies to correlate and consume threat intelligence from our network-based security solutions.
Evolved Security Architecture and Security Orchestration. Our solutions are designed to operate as part of a comprehensive security architecture to defend organizations against today's cyber threats and minimize the business impact of cyber attacks. The ability to monitor all network traffic, as well as stored files and forensic data, is critical to detecting cyber threats that enter through multiple vectors and move laterally across the network. We combine this visibility with our dynamic, contextual and strategic threat intelligence, advanced analytics and case management tools in our Helix security operations platform to enable rapid, prioritized responses to critical alerts. Our security orchestration tools and technologies integrate with Helix to extend security processes and response activities across the IT infrastructure.
Customers
Our customer base has grown to approximately 7,700 end-customers as of December 31, 2018, including more than 50% of the Forbes Global 2000. We provide products, subscriptions and services to customers of varying sizes, including enterprises, governmental agencies and educational and nonprofit organizations. Our customers include leading enterprises in a diverse set of industries, including telecommunications providers, financial services entities, Internet search engines, social networking sites, stock exchanges, electrical grid operators, networking vendors, oil and gas companies, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and leading U.S. and international 
governmental agencies. Our business is not dependent on any particular end-customer as no end-customer represented more than 10% of our revenue for any of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, one reseller represented 15%, 13% and 12%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, one distributor represented 20%, 19% and 19% respectively, of our total revenue. 
Backlog
Orders for our appliances, software, subscriptions and services are typically shipped and billed in their entirety shortly after receipt of the order, even when the delivery term for the subscription or service extends over multiple periods. These amounts are included in deferred revenue, although the timing of revenue recognition for subscriptions and services may vary depending on the contractual service period or when the services are rendered. In certain instances, a customer may request periodic billing on a multi-period subscription or service contract or we may not have a contractual right to bill at period end. In these instances, the amount billed is included in deferred revenue and the amount to be billed in the future periods is included in backlog. Subscription and services backlog has historically represented less than 3% of our annual deferred revenue and revenue. As a result, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is meaningful because it does not represent a material component of future revenue in any given period.
We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from year to year due to several factors, including the amount invoiced early in the contract term, the timing and duration of customer agreements, varying invoicing cycles of agreements and changes in customer financial circumstances. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not always a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog internally as a key management metric.
Sales and Marketing
Sales. Our sales organization consists of in-house sales teams who work in collaboration with external channel partners to identify new sales prospects, sell additional products, subscriptions and services, and provide post-sale support. Our field sales team is organized by territory and is responsible for enterprise and government accounts within their region. Our inside sales organization is responsible for sales to medium-sized and smaller organizations, and for renewal of existing subscriptions.
We also have a dedicated team focused on channel sales who manage the relationships with our value-added reseller and distributor partners and work with these channel partners to win and support customers. We believe this hybrid direct-touch sales approach allows us to leverage the benefits of broader market coverage provided by a reseller channel while maintaining a face-to-face connection with our customers, including key enterprise accounts.
We have also cultivated alliances with non-traditional partners to generate customer referrals and extend our technologies and sales coverage to new market segments. These relationships include relationships with insurance providers, large systems integrators, and managed service providers, and we have engaged in joint solution development with leading providers of engineering services, payment systems, and public cloud platforms.
Our sales organization is supported by sales engineers with deep technical domain expertise who are responsible for pre-sales technical support, solutions engineering for our customers, proof of concept work and technical training for our channel partners. Our sales engineers also act as the liaison between customers and our marketing and product development organizations.
As part of our sales strategy, we often provide prospective customers with our detection and prevention products for a short-term evaluation period, typically ranging from one week to several months. During this period, the prospective customer conducts evaluations with the assistance of our system engineers and members of our security research team. We believe that by providing proof of concept evaluations to potential customers, we are able to contrast the effectiveness of our solutions versus our competitors in identifying suspicious and potentially malicious content in their actual IT environments. For our cloud-based email security solutions, we allow customers to submit emails previously scanned by their existing email security provider for analysis by our advanced detection technologies. Additionally, our Mandiant consultants use our technologies and products in their incident response and consulting engagements, providing de facto proof of concept evaluations in the customer’s environment. Our sales cycle varies by industry and can be long and unpredictable, but is typical of large, complex enterprise sales cycles that can last several months or more. However, some transactions can close in a few weeks when an active breach is discovered.
Marketing. Our marketing is focused on building our brand reputation and market awareness for our solutions, driving customer demand and a strong sales pipeline, and working with our channel partners around the globe. Our marketing team consists primarily of corporate marketing, channel marketing, account/lead development, marketing operations and corporate communications. Marketing activities include demand generation, advertising, product launch activities, managing our corporate website and partner portal, trade shows and conferences, press and analyst relations, and customer awareness. We are also actively engaged in driving global thought leadership programs through blogs and media and developing rich content such as the global cyber map and threat reports.
Technology Alliance Partners
FireEye has built a robust ecosystem of Technology Alliance Partners who, through integration and joint go-to-market efforts, extend the breadth and depth of the cybersecurity and protection we deliver to customers. Spanning multiple technology categories, including network monitoring vendors, security information and event management vendors, network equipment vendors, forensic software vendors and web application firewall vendors, these partnerships provide for threat intelligence sharing, cross-vendor technology integrations, 
and joint solution development. By helping to ease the complexity that organizations face when implementing multi-layered security solutions, our technology alliances facilitate integrated solution design, accelerate the time to realize value, and enhance our role as a strategic security partner.
Government Affairs
We maintain relationships with several governments around the globe. Our visibility into the threat landscape, knowledge of threat actors' activities, and thought leadership in defending against cyber threats has helped to shape the legislative, regulatory and policy environment to enhance these governments’ individual and collective cyber posture. As part of this effort, we contribute to the evolving standard-making processes, help define best practices in various jurisdictions and help organizations of all sizes better understand the cyber threat landscape. We also help governments identify future needs and requirements. Through these and related activities, we engage on the front lines of emerging cybersecurity related public policy and use our knowledge and insight to improve the cybersecurity of our government and industry customers.
Manufacturing
The manufacturing of our security appliances is outsourced to principally one third-party contract manufacturer. This approach allows us to reduce our costs as it reduces our manufacturing overhead and inventory and also allows us to adjust quickly to changing customer demand. Our manufacturing partner assembles our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and it procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions.
Our primary contract manufacturer is Flex Ltd. ("Flex"). The manufacturing agreement we entered into with Flex does not provide for any minimum purchase commitments and had an initial term of one year, which automatically renews for one-year terms, unless either party gives written notice to the other party not less than 90 days prior to the last day of the applicable term. Additionally, this agreement may be terminated by either party (i) with advance written notice provided to the other party, subject to certain notice period limitations, or (ii) with written notice, subject to applicable cure periods, if the other party has materially breached its obligations under the agreement.
Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our detection, analysis and correlation engines, expand our threat intelligence, build add-on functionality to our products, and improve our core technologies. We believe that adapting our hardware, software and cloud-based technologies to changes in the threat environment is critical to maintaining and expanding our leadership in the cyber security industry. Our engineering teams have deep networking, security and data management expertise and work closely with our customers and our Mandiant consultants to identify current and future needs. Because our Mandiant consultants use our products in their incident response and compromise assessment engagements and provide continual feedback to our engineering teams on product performance, detection efficacy, evasion techniques and attack trends, we are able to adapt our solutions as the threat environment evolves.
In addition to our focus on platform expansion and enhancement, our research and development teams are focused on developing automation tools and machine learning techniques to reduce the time to discover and distribute new threat intelligence, as well as generate efficiencies in our services offerings. We are also investing in security platform management and orchestration capabilities to provide unified reporting, automated response, and security orchestration features to customers in a single dashboard.
We maintain research and development activities across the globe with teams located in Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, Singapore and the United States.
Competition
We operate in the intensely competitive IT security market which is characterized by constant change and innovation. Changes in the threat landscape and broader IT infrastructures result in evolving customer requirements for cyber security. Several vendors have either introduced new products or incorporated features into existing products that compete with our solutions. Our current and potential future competitors fall into six general categories:
•large networking vendors such as Cisco and Juniper that may emulate or integrate security features similar to ours into their own products;
•large companies such as IBM, Oracle and HPE that have acquired security solutions and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market;

• | independent security vendors such as Palo Alto Networks, Proofpoint and CrowdStrike that offer products or features that claim to perform similar functions to our platform;


• | small and large companies, including new market entrants, that offer niche product solutions that compete with some of the features present in our platform;


• | providers of traditional signature-based security solutions, such as Symantec and McAfee; and


• | other providers of incident response and compromise assessment services.

As our market grows and a larger share of IT budgets is allocated to cybersecurity, it will attract more highly specialized vendors as well as larger technology vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their products more effectively. The principal competitive factors in our market include:

• | ability to deliver the combination of technology, intelligence and expertise necessary to combat the current threat landscape;


• | ability to detect and prevent known and unknown threats by overcoming the limitations of signature-based approaches, while maintaining a low rate of false-positive alerts;


• | scalability, throughput and overall performance of our detection and prevention technologies;


• | visibility into all stages of an attack, especially the exploit phase;


• | ability to consolidate features onto a single platform, thereby reducing the complexity of maintaining solutions from multiple vendors;


• | the ability to integrate with third-party IT providers to enable an orchestrated solution of products and services that detect, prevent and resolve cybersecurity threats across multiple attack vectors;


• | breadth and richness of the shared threat intelligence, including dynamic and contextual threat intelligence on cyber crime, cyber espionage, hacktivism, attacks on critical infrastructure and nation-state attacks;


• | flexible deployment options, including on-premise appliances, cloud-based software or a hybrid of both, as well as "as-a-service" options;


• | brand awareness and reputation;


• | strength and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;


• | product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technologies in the network infrastructure;


• | ease of use and customer experience; and


• | price and total cost of ownership.

We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of the features and performance of our platform, the ease of integration of our products with network infrastructures, the breadth of our services and solution offerings and the relatively low total cost of ownership of our products. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, deeper customer relationships, broader distribution, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property. We rely on, among other things, patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality safeguards and procedures, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We file patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is sufficient when considering the expected lives of our products. We cannot assure you whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of valuable breadth or applicability. In addition, any patents that may issue may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. We also license software from third parties for integration into our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.
We control access to and use of our proprietary software, technology and other proprietary information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end-customers and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright, patent and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our software, technology and other proprietary information, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology and other proprietary information. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. If we become more successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop 
products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights. In particular, large and established companies in the IT security industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. From time-to-time, third parties, including certain of these large companies and non-practicing entities, may assert patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners, or our end-customers, whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party, if any, could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions, or force us to pay substantial damages (including, in the United States, treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents), royalties or other fees. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business” for additional information.
