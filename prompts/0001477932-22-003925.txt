Item 1. Description of Business
Corporate Developments
 
Brisset Beer International, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on May 11, 2010, under the name Benefit Solutions Outsourcing Corp. The Company was initially formed to offer small and medium-sized businesses services that reduced invoicing expenses, sped up receipt of monies, and allowed authorization and recovery of paper drafts.
 
On April 4, 2014, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Scenario A, a Quebec corporation (“Scenario A”), to purchase all of its assets relating to “Broken 7”, a craft beer to be brewed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, for a purchase price of $25,000. The Asset Purchase Agreement relates to the Broken 7 trademark and recipe only. No other assets were acquired. $12,500 was paid at closing and $12,500 was to be paid 60 business days after the closing date of April 7, 2014. By letter agreement dated July 16, 2014, the parties agreed to extend the date on which the second payment of $12,500 was due to August 15, 2014. The Company made the final installment of $12,500 to Scenario A on August 14, 2014.
 
Effective July 24, 2014, the Company changed its state of incorporation from Florida to Nevada and its name from “Buckeye Oil & Gas, Inc.” to “Brisset Beer International, Inc.” by the merger of Buckeye Oil & Gas, Inc. with and into its wholly owned subsidiary, Brisset Beer International, Inc.
 
Until April 2014, the Company was engaged in the acquisition and exploration of oil and gas properties. Since its asset purchase in April 2014, the Company has abandoned its interests in its two oil and gas properties and is principally engaged in the development of a brewing, distribution, and marketing of craft-brewed beer business in the province of Quebec, Canada. Our craft beer consists of a single brand known as Broken 7, which we distribute to private retail stores, grocery chains and on-premise accounts across Quebec, Canada.
 
On November 10, 2014, the Company entered into a Service Agreement with Sandberg International Limited to provide investor relations for the Company. For such services, Sandberg International receives $500 per month, and on November 10, 2014, was issued 125,000 shares of common stock of the Company, Class A warrants to purchase 125,000 shares of common stock exercisable at $0.15 per share and a Class B warrant to purchase 125,000 shares of common stock exercisable at $0.25 per share. The agreement shall continue until either party notifies the other that it desires to terminate the agreement on 30 days' written notice.

On December 2, 2014 Biere Brisset International Inc., a Canadian corporation wholly-owned subsidiary by  Company (“BBII”), entered into a five-year Manufacturing and Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with 90127-2021 Quebec Inc., a Quebec company doing business as Breuvages Blue Spike (“Blue Spike”) pursuant to which Blue Spike has the exclusive right to manufacture, distribute and sell BBII's Broken 7 beer in certain designated networks in the following Canadian provinces and U.S. states: Newfoundland, Prince-Edward Island, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Washington DC, Delaware, Maryland. The Company granted Blue Spike a right of first refusal to act as exclusive agent for the distribution and sale of its products in other new territories.
 
On April 1, 2016, BBII amended the Distribution agreement (the “Amendment”) with Blue Spike to clarify certain of the business terms regarding the margins, pricing, and distribution networks.
 
Subject to Blue Spike's approval, the Company may sell products manufactured by Blue Spike in the Company's own distribution network. Products sold within the Company's own distribution network are subject to higher margins for the Company. The Company is responsible, at its expense, for the marketing and promotion of Broken 7, and has agreed to invest 25% of the gross margin of its products for marketing and advertising.
 
The Company granted Blue Spike a right of first refusal if the Company sells or transfers all or a portion of its rights in its brands. If the Company is sold during the term of the agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Blue Spike 2.5% of the purchase price for every $250,000 of product sales, up to $5 million but not to exceed 50% of the sale price. The agreement also provides for various payment returns to Blue Spike if the Company is sold when the agreement is no longer in effect, depending on when and why the agreement is no longer in effect. The agreement will automatically renew for an additional five-year term unless either party notifies the other of its intention not to renew 180 days prior to the expiration of the initial term.
 
On March 1, 2015, BBII entered into a five-year manufacturing and distribution agreement (the “CBB Agreement”) with La Compagnie de Biere Brisset, Inc. (“CBB”), a specialty brewer, to help bring to market and test new line extensions for beer brands owned by the Company. The CBB Agreement grants CBB the right to manufacture Broken 7 beer in accordance with certain minimum and production capacities set forth in the Agreement. Proceeds, if any, from the sale of BBI products will be retained by CBB as compensation for its services. Unless earlier terminated by BBII's bankruptcy, insolvency or sale of its business or assets or the gross misconduct or negligence of CBB, the Agreement will automatically renew for an additional five-year term unless either party notifies the other of its intention not to renew 180 days prior to the expiration of the initial term.
 
On April 1, 2016, BBII amended the manufacturing and distribution agreement (the “Amendment”) with Blue Spike to clarify certain of the business terms regarding the margins, pricing, and distribution networks.
 
The Distribution Agreement and the CBB Agreement were terminated on March 2, 2018.
 
We are currently seeking acquisition partners we believe would be beneficial for the Company and our shareholders. To this end, we intent to begin the process of identifying sectors and industries that current management believes will provide the most long-term and short-term benefit to the existing and future shareholders of the Company. However, as of the date of this Report we have not identified any potential acquisition candidates or entered any negotiations relating to the same.
