Overview
We are a medical aesthetics company focused on delivering advanced aesthetic procedures and treatments to physicians and consumers. We focus on the self-pay aesthetic market and our first product candidate, PrabotulinumtoxinA (DWP-450) is an injectable 900 kDa botulinum toxin type A complex designed to address the needs of the large and growing facial aesthetics market. We believe we will offer physicians and consumers a compelling value proposition with DWP-450. Currently, onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX) is the neurotoxin market leader and the only known approved 900 kDa botulinum toxin type A complex in the United States. We believe aesthetic physicians generally prefer the performance characteristics of the complete 900 kDa neurotoxin complex and are accustomed to injecting this formulation. We have completed the clinical development program for DWP-450 for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines, also known as “frown lines,” between the eyebrows, in the United States, EU and Canada. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, issued a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date of May 15, 2018 for completion of its review of our Biologics License Application, or BLA. We submitted a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and it was accepted for review in July 2017 with a decision that we expect by the second half of 2018. We have also submitted a New Drug Submission, or NDS, to Health Canada and it was accepted for review in October 2017 with a decision that we expect by the second half of 2018.
We successfully completed a comprehensive five-study DWP-450 clinical development program in the United States, EU and Canada to meet the regulatory requirements for a BLA in the United States, a MAA in the EU and a NDS in Canada, for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. The program, which was developed in consultation with the FDA and European regulatory bodies, included three multicenter, randomized, controlled, single dose Phase III studies and two open label, multiple dose, long-term Phase II studies. Over 2,100 adult male and female subjects with moderate to severe glabellar lines at maximum frown participated in the program. All three Phase III studies successfully met their respective primary endpoints.
Our primary market is the self-pay aesthetic market, which includes medical products purchased by physicians that are then sold to consumers or used in procedures for aesthetic indications that are not reimbursed by any third-party payor, such as Medicaid, Medicare or commercial insurance. Within the self-pay aesthetic market, the global aesthetic neurotoxin market was estimated to generate approximately $1.8 billion of revenue in 2017 and is estimated to grow to approximately $2.3 billion in 2020. The United States is the largest portion of this market and was estimated to generate approximately $941 million of revenue in 2017 and is expected to grow to approximately $1.2 billion in 2020. We believe the continued growth of the aesthetic neurotoxin market will be driven by an aging population, increased use by individuals between the ages of 19 and 34, whom we refer to as Millennials, rising disposable income, improved accessibility to these products and treatments due to an increase in the number of physicians who perform these procedures, continued innovation, and an increasing acceptance and utilization of elective or minimally invasive aesthetic procedures.
If approved, we plan to launch DWP-450 in the United States by building a commercialization infrastructure, including a specialty sales force of approximately 65 sales representatives within our first year of commercial launch and growing to 150 sales representatives over time. We intend for our sales force to market the product to aesthetic practices, beginning with U.S. board certified dermatologists, plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons and oculoplastic surgeons at launch and expanding to the broader aesthetic injector market over time. We intend to establish brand awareness for DWP-450 through national public relations, social media and direct-to-consumer media campaigns, which are widely-used commercialization channels for aesthetic neurotoxin products. In the long-term, we plan to capitalize on our commercialization infrastructure and our relationships with key aesthetic physicians to provide a comprehensive medical aesthetics portfolio over time, thereby driving continued revenue growth without a proportional increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses. Outside of the United States, we plan to market and sell DWP-450 through distributors in the territories in which we have the right to sell it.
On September 30, 2013, we entered into a license and supply agreement, or the Daewoong Agreement, pursuant to which we have an exclusive distribution license to DWP-450 from Daewoong Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., or Daewoong, a South Korean pharmaceutical manufacturer, for aesthetic indications in the United States, EU, Canada, Australia, Russia, Commonwealth of Independent States, or C.I.S., and South Africa, as well as co-exclusive distribution rights with Daewoong in Japan. We also have an option to exercise a similar license in these territories for therapeutic indications by the end of 2018, which we have assigned to and are currently holding in trust for ALPHAEON. DWP-450 will be manufactured by Daewoong in a recently constructed facility in South Korea that is designed with the intention of complying with FDA and EMA current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements. We also have the option to negotiate first with Daewoong to secure a

distribution license for any product that Daewoong directly or indirectly develops or commercializes that is classified as an injectable botulinum toxin (other than DWP-450) in a territory covered by the license.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we will offer physicians and consumers a compelling value proposition beginning with the launch of DWP-450, if approved, for the following reasons:

• | DWP-450 will offer the U.S. market the first known 900 kDa neurotoxin alternative to BOTOX. Both DWP-450 and BOTOX manufacturing start with a 900 kDa complex, include adding the excipients human serum albumin, or HSA, and sodium chloride, and are finished by vacuum drying. If approved, DWP-450 is expected to be the only known neurotoxin product in the United States with a 900 kDa neurotoxin complex other than BOTOX. We believe an important component of competitiveness in the neurotoxin market relates to the characteristics associated with the 900 kDa complex and the potential of the accessory proteins to increase the effectiveness of the active toxin portion of the complex.


• | DWP-450 may be easily integrated into existing aesthetic physician practices. DWP-450 was clinically tested with one DWP-450 unit compared to one BOTOX unit. In the study, both products were stored, prepared and injected identically. We believe aesthetic physicians’ familiarity with the 900 kDa neurotoxin complex’s handling, preparation and dosing will more easily facilitate incorporation of DWP-450 into their practices.


• | Enhanced level of physician-customer interaction through an aesthetic-only marketing strategy. We have elected to specifically target the self-pay aesthetic market. With a reduced regulatory burden compared to third-party payor reimbursed markets, we believe we will achieve a number of benefits that market participants in reimbursed markets are unable to achieve, such as an enhanced level of interaction with our physician-customers. It is expected that upon U.S. approval, DWP-450 will be the only U.S. neurotoxin without a therapeutic indication. We believe pursuing an aesthetic-only non-reimbursed product strategy will allow for meaningful strategic advantages in the United States, including pricing and marketing flexibility. We intend to utilize this flexibility to drive market adoption through programs such as promotional events, sampling programs and pricing strategies.


• | We have strong relationships with aesthetic key opinion leaders, or KOLs. We have established relationships with aesthetic KOLs as a result of our management team’s industry experience and engagement of our clinical trial investigators. In addition, there are approximately 250 KOLs who have invested in our parent organizations, creating financial alignment with our success. KOLs are important information resources to the general physician-customer market due to their clinical expertise, academic reputations, active clinical practices and their status as medical innovators. The broader physician community often looks to KOLs for their experience with products and procedures as part of their new product and procedure adoption process.


• | Our management team has significant experience and expertise in medical aesthetics. Our management team has extensive experience in self-pay healthcare markets, in the development, market launch and commercialization of major medical products, execution and integration of business development transactions, identification of and partnerships with KOLs, and understanding of the regulatory environment of the healthcare markets. Key members of our leadership team have also served in relevant senior leadership positions with leading aesthetic companies.

Our Strategy
Our near-term strategy is to enter the U.S. medical aesthetic neurotoxin market with DWP-450. We plan to expand our product offerings over time through in-licensing, partnerships and acquisitions. The key components of our strategy are:

• | Achieve regulatory approval of DWP-450. We believe the experience of our management team improves our ability to advance DWP-450 through the development phase and increases the likelihood of successfully obtaining approval for our product candidate. We also believe the completion of our clinical development program for the glabellar line indication and the acceptance of our BLA within three years of enrollment of the first patient demonstrates our ability to execute an effective development plan. In addition, we have worked with Daewoong to build a custom facility designed for neurotoxin manufacturing under FDA and EMA cGMP requirements during this pre-commercialization period.


• | Launch the first known 900 kDa neurotoxin in the United States since BOTOX was launched 15 years ago. The U.S. aesthetic neurotoxin market has been dominated by BOTOX since it received FDA approval for the treatment of

4

glabellar lines in 2002. As the only known commercially approved 900 kDa neurotoxin for the last 15 years, BOTOX has flourished in an economic market structure with only one 900 kDa product option and significant barriers to entry, including a strenuous regulatory approval process. DWP-450, if approved, is expected to be the only known BOTOX alternative in the United States with a 900 kDa complex and Phase III clinical testing of one DWP-450 unit to one BOTOX unit. We believe these product characteristics will enable aesthetic physicians who use BOTOX to more easily incorporate DWP-450 in their practices.

• | Pursue an aesthetic-only marketing strategy. It is expected that upon U.S. approval, DWP-450 will be the only U.S. neurotoxin without a therapeutic indication. An aesthetic-only indication is an important strategic advantage because it provides greater flexibility around pricing and marketing strategies compared to neurotoxin manufacturers with aesthetic and therapeutic sales. Current U.S. neurotoxin manufacturers are required to calculate their neurotoxin’s average sales price, or ASP, inclusive of both aesthetic and therapeutic sales, for purposes of therapeutic reimbursement. As a result, we believe that U.S. neurotoxin manufacturers limit aesthetic neurotoxin discounting to protect their therapeutic neurotoxin reimbursement rate, with therapeutic sales representing approximately 60% of all U.S. neurotoxin sales in 2016. By contrast, we will not have a therapeutic indication for DWP-450 upon commercialization and therefore will have greater flexibility in our pricing strategies. We will utilize this flexibility to create a compelling value proposition for aesthetic physicians. Additionally, our aesthetic-only focus will allow us marketing flexibility and the ability to pursue our neurotoxin commercial strategy.


• | Leverage our strong KOL relationships in medical aesthetics for our commercial launch. We will utilize our strong KOL relationships to facilitate the awareness of the DWP-450 clinical evidence to the broader aesthetic physician community. Since KOLs opinions are valued due to their clinical expertise, academic reputations, active clinical practices and status as medical innovators, we believe the aesthetic KOLs, including our indirect investors, will be important in influencing aesthetic physician buying decisions. We plan to utilize our KOLs to assist in scientific presentations, publications and other methods by which we will drive awareness.


• | Build a commercialization infrastructure with specialized sales and marketing functions. We intend to establish a commercial infrastructure targeting board certified dermatologists, plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons and oculoplastic surgeons at launch and expanding to the broader aesthetic injector market over time. We will hire experienced sales professionals who will reflect our commitment to serving physicians and their patients with a high level of service and engagement. We will partner with established distributors outside the United States to reach and serve physicians and consumers in those territories.


• | Establish a leading medical aesthetics company by in-licensing technology, developing partnerships and potentially acquiring products. Our long-term strategy is to build our company into a leading medical aesthetics company. We believe that an aesthetic neurotoxin is an attractive entry point for building a medical aesthetic portfolio as the aesthetic neurotoxin segment is one of the largest product segments in the self-pay medical aesthetics market. We intend to add additional self-pay medical aesthetics products that yield high patient satisfaction. We will use the insights of our management team to develop partnerships, in-license technology and potentially acquire products to expand our medical aesthetics product offerings over time. These products may include dermal fillers, aesthetic lasers, energy devices, and breast implants. We believe that we will create a commercial infrastructure and maintain relationships with key aesthetic physicians that can be leveraged over time to offer a medical aesthetics portfolio to our customers to drive growth without a significant increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses.

Our Market
Our primary market is self-pay healthcare, which includes medical products purchased by physicians that are then sold to consumers or used in procedures for aesthetic indications that are not reimbursed by any third-party payor, such as Medicaid, Medicare or commercial insurance. By focusing on the self-pay medical aesthetics market, we believe we will not be exposed to reimbursement risk associated with a reliance on payments from such third-party payors and we will be subject to fewer regulations that place limits on the types of marketing and other interactions we can have with physicians. For example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or the Anti-Kickback Statute, imposes significant restrictions on the ability of healthcare manufacturers who have products or services reimbursed by a federal healthcare program to interact with physicians in relation to the marketing of their products. We believe our clinical data and clinical testing of one DWP-450 unit to one BOTOX unit, together with the reduced regulatory burden and related flexibility in marketing and pricing, will improve our ability to generate product demand for DWP-450.

The global self-pay medical aesthetics neurotoxin market was estimated to generate approximately $1.8 billion of revenue in 2017 and is estimated to grow to approximately $2.3 billion in 2020. The global self-pay medical aesthetics market was estimated to generate approximately $9.3 billion of revenue in 2015 and is estimated to grow to approximately $15.1 billion in 2020, representing a 10% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of which the United States comprises the largest portion of the market at an estimated $3.9 billion of revenue in 2015, and is estimated to grow at an 11% CAGR during the same period. We believe the growth in both the self-pay medical aesthetics neurotoxin market and the overall self-pay medical aesthetics market is being driven by a number of factors, including: 

• | an aging population consisting of both Generation X, comprised of individuals between the ages of 35 and 50, and Baby Boomers, comprised of individuals between the ages of 51 and 64;


• | individuals between the ages of 19 and 34, whom we refer to as Millennials, seeking to prophylactically delay the appearance of aging and utilizing neurotoxins as an entry point for aesthetic procedures due to its minimally invasive nature;


• | an increasing life expectancy, which is resulting in consumers with a desire for improved appearance and well-being;


• | rising disposable income, with the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reporting that real disposable income in the United States increased approximately 17% from March 2012 to March 2017;


• | growing awareness, utilization and acceptance of elective or minimally invasive aesthetic procedures; and


• | continued innovation and improved accessibility to these treatments due to an increase in the number of physicians who perform these procedures.

We believe the demand for aesthetic treatment for facial lines has stimulated growth in the use of botulinum toxin type A, given the neurotoxin’s minimally invasive nature of the treatment, effectiveness, ease of use, and safety profile. Additionally, a consumer is able to have the procedure performed with minimal interruption to daily life primarily because most treatments require less than 30 minutes to be completed and have little to no recovery period. In general, the results of neurotoxin treatments may last up to four months but are not permanent. As a result, consumers may seek repeat procedures to maintain the product’s effect, which translates into recurring revenue generation for manufacturers and physicians.
The large and established U.S. aesthetic neurotoxin market includes a wide range of age groups. In 2016, approximately 39% of total U.S. nonsurgical procedures were performed on Generation X consumers and approximately 31% were performed on Baby Boomer consumers. Millennial consumers represent a growing segment of the aesthetic neurotoxin market with data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons showing a 49% increase between 2009 and 2016 in the number of botulinum toxin type A procedures in consumers aged 20 to 29, which is the younger subset of the age 19 to 34 Millennial generation. In 2016, this 20 to 29 age group made up approximately 16% of total U.S. nonsurgical procedures in 2016, and we believe provides a source of future growth.
The current medical aesthetics botulinum toxin type A market is set forth in the following table:

Botulinum toxin type A prices have increased consistently in recent years. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, the ASP of BOTOX was approximately $578 per 100 unit vial as of December 2017, up nearly 10% or over approximately $52, from its December 2014 ASP of approximately $526 per 100 unit vial. The ASP of Dysport was approximately $466 per 300 unit vial as of December 2017, up nearly 8% or over approximately $35, from its December 2014 ASP of approximately $431 per 300 unit vial. Further, the ASP of Xeomin was approximately $479 per 100 unit vial as of December 2017, up nearly 13% or over approximately $57, from its December 2014 ASP of approximately $422 per 100 unit vial. Many physicians have expressed frustration with increasing neurotoxin prices. According to a physician survey conducted by Bernstein Research in the second quarter of 2017, approximately 41% of physicians surveyed stated that they would be willing to try a new neurotoxin with a material discount strategy.
DWP-450 Overview
We licensed DWP-450 from Daewoong in September 2013 and commenced clinical trials in 2014. DWP-450 is an injectable formulation of a 900 kDa botulinum toxin type A complex designed to address the needs of the large and growing facial aesthetics market. We completed a comprehensive five-study DWP-450 clinical development program in the United States, EU and Canada to meet the regulatory requirements for a BLA in the United States, a MAA in the EU, and a NDS in Canada, for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. Our program was developed in consultation with the FDA and European regulatory bodies. These regulatory bodies provided guidance and feedback on the critical endpoints and statistical methodology required to develop the safety and efficacy endpoints that would support this indication’s approval.
The clinical program included three randomized, controlled, single dose Phase III studies, and two open label, multiple dose, long-term Phase II safety studies. Over 2,100 adult male and female subjects with moderate to severe glabellar lines at maximum frown participated in the program. All three Phase III studies successfully met their respective primary endpoints. A BLA and MAA seeking approval for the treatment of adult patients with glabellar lines was accepted and validated by the FDA and EMA, respectively, in July 2017 and a NDS was accepted by Health Canada in October 2017 on the basis of these studies. The FDA issued a PDUFA date of May 15, 2018 for completion of its review of our BLA. If approved, DWP-450 is expected to be the first known 900 kDa neurotoxin product in the United States since BOTOX was approved for the treatment of glabellar lines in 2002. Our MAA was accepted for review in July 2017 with a decision that we expect by the second half of 2018.
As demonstrated in the figure below, DWP-450 contains a 900 kDa botulinum toxin type A complex produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The active part of the neurotoxin is the 150 kDa component, and the remaining 750 kDA of the complex is made up of accessory proteins that we believe help with the function of the active portion of the toxin. DWP-450 has the same mechanism of action as other type A botulinum toxins. When injected intramuscularly at therapeutic doses, botulinum toxin causes a chemical denervation of the muscle resulting in localized reduction of muscle activity. Botulinum toxin type A specifically blocks peripheral acetylcholine release at presynaptic cholinergic nerve terminals by cleaving SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within the nerve endings leading to denervation and relaxation of the muscle.

Daewoong South Korean Clinical Development for Glabellar Lines
In South Korea, two DWP-450 clinical studies were used to support Daewoong’s BLA to the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, or MFDS, including one Phase I study and one Phase III study. Both studies were double blind, randomized trials with an active control. Both compared 20 units of Nabota, a DWP-450 formulation, with 20 units of BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA), injected as 4 units per 0.1 milliliters, or mL, into each of five target sites in the glabellar region of adult subjects with moderate to severe glabellar lines. Both the Phase I and Phase III study used the investigator’s assessment of the improvement of glabellar lines at maximum frown on a four-point Glabellar Line Severity scale to evaluate efficacy, where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe glabellar lines at maximum frown.
Phase I Clinical Trial. The Phase I study included 20 randomized subjects, with 10 subjects receiving Nabota and 10 subjects receiving BOTOX. The average ages, ratios of males to females, and the rating of glabellar lines at maximum frown and at rest at 4 weeks were similar between the two groups. Two adverse events, or AEs, were reported: a mild case of dizziness in a Nabota subject and a mild case of headache in a BOTOX subject.
Phase III Clinical Trial. The Phase III study included 268 randomized subjects, with 135 subjects receiving Nabota and 133 subjects receiving BOTOX. The primary efficacy endpoint was the responder rate at maximum frown at 4 weeks. A responder was defined as a subject with a Glabellar Line Severity scale score of none (0) or mild (1), based on the investigator’s assessment of glabellar lines. In a per protocol analysis, the responder rate was 93.9% in the Nabota group and 
8

88.6% in the BOTOX group. The difference between these groups was 5.3% and the lower limit of the 97.5% one-sided confidence interval was -1.53%. A confidence interval, or CI, is a range of values in which, statistically, there is a specified level of confidence where the result lies. In this Phase III study, the results indicate that there is a 97.5% level of confidence that the difference between the Nabota and BOTOX responder rates was between -1.53% and 5.26%, which we express as: 97.5% CI (-1.53, 5.26). Based on the lower limit of the confidence interval surpassing a pre-determined -15.0% threshold for non-inferiority, the Nabota treatment group was determined to be non-inferior to BOTOX.

Korean Phase III Primary Endpoint - Responder Rates at Week 4, Glabellar Line Severity at Maximum Frown by Investigator Assessment | Korean Phase III Primary Endpoint - Non-Inferiority, Glabellar Line Severity at Maximum Frown by Investigator Assessment

A secondary efficacy endpoint was the responder rate at maximum frown at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks, with a responder defined as a subject with a Glabellar Line Severity scale score of none (0) or mild (1), based on the investigator’s assessment of glabellar lines. The responder rates for the Nabota group were 93.6%, 83.9%, 75.6% and 62.1% at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks, respectively. For the BOTOX group, the responder rates were 89.3%, 82.6%, 70.0% and 54.6% at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks, respectively. The overall AE rate was 20.0% and 18.1% in the Nabota and BOTOX groups respectively, and the drug related AE rate was 5.9% and 4.5% in the Nabota and BOTOX groups respectively. There was one serious adverse event, or SAE, in the trial and it was assessed as not study drug related.
Korean Phase III Secondary Endpoint - Improvement in Rates for Glabellar Lines Severity at Maximum Frown by Investigator Assessment
South Korean Approval. Nabota was approved by the MFDS for marketing on November 29, 2013 for the treatment of glabellar lines. The Nabota DWP-450 formulation in the South Korean study and that is currently being commercialized by Daewoong is slightly different than the formulation used in our sponsored studies. The HSA used in our formulation is licensed and approved by the FDA and is certified by the EMA, whereas the HSA currently used in the Nabota formulation is not. In addition, the Nabota formulation is lyophilized, or freeze dried, whereas the product we intend to commercialize, if approved, is vacuum dried. See the section entitled “Additional Safety Evaluations” below for additional information.

Evolus Clinical Development for Glabellar Lines
In 2014, we initiated a comprehensive five-study DWP-450 clinical development program in the United States, EU and Canada to meet the regulatory requirements for a BLA in the United States, a MAA in the EU, and a NDS in Canada, for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. The program, which was developed in consultation with the FDA and European regulatory bodies, included three multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled, single dose Phase III studies titled EV-001, EV-002 and EVB-003. Each Phase III study lasted 150 days. We also completed two open label, multiple dose, long-term Phase II studies titled EV-004 and EV-006, each lasting one year. Between September 2014 and August 2016, over 2,100 adult male and female subjects with moderate to severe glabellar lines at maximum frown participated in this program.
In our clinical trials, subjects received intramuscular injections in five target sites in muscles that contribute to the formation of glabellar lines: the midline of the procerus, the inferomedial aspect of each corrugator, and the superior middle aspect of each corrugator. Each of the five target sites was injected with 0.1mL for a total of 0.5mL. Subjects assigned (in the open label studies) or randomized (in the controlled studies) to DWP-450 received a total of 20 units per treatment, administered as 4 units per 0.1 mL and those subjects who were randomized to the placebo group received 0.5 mL saline. In our EVB-003 Phase III trial, the only study of the five with both a placebo and active control arm, subjects randomized to the active control received a total of 20 units of BOTOX administered as 4 units per 0.1 mL. As in the Korean studies, 20 units of BOTOX served as the active control in EVB-003. In the multiple dose studies, eligible subjects could receive up to four treatments of 20 units of DWP-450 each.
All five studies contributed data to the evaluation of efficacy and safety. The table below summarizes our five-study DWP-450 clinical development program.

Phase III U.S. Based Clinical Trials. The two identical U.S. Phase III studies, EV-001 and EV-002, enrolled subjects who were selected from a population of healthy adults, at least 18 years of age, who had moderate to severe glabellar lines at maximum frown, as independently assessed by the investigator and subject using the 4-point photonumeric Glabellar Line Scale, or GLS, where 0=no lines, 1=mild lines, 2=moderate lines and 3=severe lines. On Day 0, eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single treatment of either DWP-450 or placebo. Subjects were followed for 150 days.
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the proportion of subjects classified as responders on Day 30. This was a composite endpoint in which a responder was a subject with a 2 point improvement or greater on the GLS from Day 0 to Day 30 at maximum frown, only if independently agreed by both investigator and subject assessment. In keeping with the FDA guidance, this was deemed to be a clinically meaningful composite primary efficacy endpoint.
Both studies met the primary endpoint of superiority over placebo. The percentages of responders in the intent to treat population for the composite primary endpoint, a two point or greater score composite improvement, in each of the two controlled single dose studies were:

• | EV-001: 1.2% placebo, 67.5% DWP-450, with an absolute difference between the groups of 66.3%, 95% CI (59.0, 72.4)

11


• | EV-002: 1.3% placebo, 70.4% DWP-450, with an absolute difference between the groups of 69.1%, 95% CI (61.5, 75.1)

U.S. Phase III Primary Endpoint - Composite Score ≥ 2 Point GLS Improvement at Maximum Frown on Day 30
Since a two point or greater composite score requires both the investigator and subject to agree simultaneously, studies using this definition generally have a lower responder rate than non-composite studies. Xeomin and Dysport represent two botulinum toxin type A products who also conducted trials using a two point or greater composite responder rate. The Xeomin two point or greater responder rates in their Phase III studies, per FDA labels, were 48% and 60%, and the Dysport rates were 52%, 55% and 60%. Importantly, no comparison across any of the studies can be made. 
U.S. Phase III Primary Endpoint - Components of Composite Score, ≥ 2 Point GLS Improvement at Maximum Frown on Day 30 by Investigator and Subject Assessment
In the EV-001 study, analysis of the secondary endpoints investigated the response at maximum frown beyond Day 30 using a two point composite score. A subject was considered a responder only if a ≥2 point improvement had occurred on the GLS at maximum frown from Day 0, by both investigator and subject assessment: 

• | At Day 90 (post hoc), the percentage of responders was 1.3% in the placebo group and 26.5% in the DWP-450 group with an absolute difference of 25.2%, p<0.001.


• | At Day 120, the percentage of responders was 1.3% in the placebo group and 8.3% in the DWP-450 group with an absolute difference of 7.0%, p=0.023.


• | At Day 150 or early termination, the percentage of responders was 0.0% in the placebo group and 4.6% in the DWP-450 group. The absolute difference of 4.6% between the groups remained statistically significant for the composite endpoint, p=0.041. 

A p value, as expressed in the data above, is the probability that the difference between two data sets was due to chance. The smaller the p value, the more likely the differences are not due to chance alone. In general, if the p value is less than or equal 
12

to 0.05, the outcome is statistically significant. 
The 2 point composite score results were similar in the EV-002 study to the EV-001 study for the secondary endpoints:

• | At Day 90 (post hoc), the percentage of responders was 0.0% in the placebo group and 25.8% in the DWP-450 group with an absolute difference of 25.8%, p<0.001.


• | At Day 120, the percentage of responders was 0.0% in the placebo group and 12.4% in the DWP-450 group, with an absolute difference of 12.4%, p<0.001.


• | At Day 150 or early termination, the percentage of responders was 0.0% in the placebo group and 4.6% in the DWP-450 group. The absolute difference of 4.6% between the groups remained statistically significant for the composite endpoint, p=0.047.

Additional exploratory efficacy analyses in the EV-001 and EV-002 studies were conducted where DWP-450 was investigated for a one point or greater improvement as assessed by either the subject or investigator at various days at maximum frown based on the GLS. DWP-450 was compared against a placebo at 2 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days, 120 days and 150 days or early termination.
U.S. Phase III Exploratory Endpoints - ≥ 1 Point Improvement GLS at Maximum Frown
In each of the EV-001 and EV-002 studies, we also assessed as an exploratory endpoint investigator and patient assessments on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale, or GAIS. The GAIS is a five-point scale on which an evaluator, the subject or investigator, can determine the aesthetic outcome for the subject from: much improved, improved, no change, worse or much 
13

worse. The rate of positive responders, those who were assessed by either the subject or the investigator as much improved or improved, over the course of the study is provided below.
U.S. Phase III studies Exploratory Endpoint - Global Aesthetic Improvement Responders (Much Improved/Improved)
EV-002 Subject - Glabellar Lines at Maximum Frown
In the EV-001 study, the AE rate was 32.1% in the placebo group and 38.2% in the DWP-450 group. Placebo and DWP-450 groups were similar in the overall incidence of subjects who experienced one or more AEs. Three DWP-450 subjects (3/246, 
14

1.2%) experienced SAEs, but none were assessed as study drug related. Placebo and DWP-450 groups were also similar in the percentages of subjects who experienced AEs assessed by the investigator as study drug related: 13.1% of placebo subjects and 15.4% of DWP-450 subjects. The eyelid and eyebrow ptosis rates, the drooping of an upper eyelid or eyebrow, respectively, in the DWP-450 group was 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively.
In the EV-002 study, the AE rate was 26.9% in the placebo group and 28.5% in the DWP-450 group. Placebo and DWP-450 groups were similar in the overall incidence of subjects who experienced one or more AEs. Four DWP-450 subjects (4/246, 1.6%) experienced a SAE, but none were assessed as study drug related. Placebo and DWP-450 groups were also similar in the percentages of subjects who experienced an AE assessed by the investigator as study drug related: 7.7% of placebo subjects and 9.8% of DWP-450 subjects. The eyelid and eyebrow ptosis rates in the DWP-450 arm were 1.2% and 0.4% respectively. Overall, AEs with an incidence of 1% or greater were headache at 9.3% in the DWP-450 groups and 7.6% in the placebo groups and eyelid ptosis at 1% in the DWP-450 groups and 0% in the placebo groups.
U.S. Phase III Trials - Adverse Event Rate Summary
Phase III European Clinical Trial for Glabellar Lines
The EVB-003 study was the third Phase III safety and efficacy study in the DWP-450 clinical development program, and was conducted in Europe and Canada. 540 subjects with moderate to severe glabellar lines, or a GLS score of 2 or 3, as assessed by the investigator, were eligible to be enrolled provided that subjects also felt their glabellar lines had an important psychological impact, such as on their mood, anxiety or depressive symptoms. On Day 0, eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 5:5:1 ratio to receive a single treatment of 20 units of DWP-450, 20 units of BOTOX or placebo. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the proportion of subjects classified as responders on Day 30. A responder was a subject with a GLS score of 0 or 1, as assessed by the investigator at maximum frown. The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint in the EVB-003 study showed DWP-450’s superiority over placebo, and established DWP-450’s non-inferiority to BOTOX. The percentages of responders for the primary efficacy endpoint were:

• | 4.2% in the placebo group, 95% CI (0.0, 9.8);


• | 82.8% in the BOTOX group, 95% CI (78.1, 87.5); and


• | 87.2% in the DWP-450 group, 95% CI (83.0, 91.5).

The absolute differences between the treatment groups were:

• | 83.1% between DWP-450 and placebo groups, 95% CI (70.3, 89.4), (p<0.001), indicating DWP-450 was superior to placebo; and


• | 4.4% between DWP-450 and BOTOX groups, 95% CI (-1.9, 10.8), with non‑inferiority of DWP-450 versus BOTOX concluded based on the lower bound of the 95% CI for the absolute difference exceeding -10.0%.

EU Phase III Primary Endpoint - Responder Rates at Maximum Frown on Day 30 (GLS = 0 or 1) by Investigator Assessment | EU Phase III Primary Endpoint - Non-Inferiority, at Maximum Frown on Day 30 by Investigator Assessment

As presented in the table below, within each group, 32.7% of placebo subjects, 41.9% of BOTOX subjects and 37.6% of DWP-450 subjects experienced AEs. One placebo subject (1/49, 2.0%), one BOTOX subject (1/246, 0.4%) and three DWP-450 subjects (3/245, 1.2%) experienced a total of 11 SAEs and none were assessed as study drug related. The eyelid ptosis rates were 1.6% in the DWP-450 arm and 0% in the BOTOX arm and the eyebrow ptosis rates were 0% in the DWP-450 arm and 0.4% in the BOTOX arm.
EU Phase III Trial - Adverse Event Rate Summary
Phase II Repeat Dose Clinical Trial for Glabellar Lines
The primary objective of the Phase II EV-004 study was to demonstrate the safety of DWP-450 in adult subjects receiving repeat doses of DWP-450 for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. This multi-dose study lasted one year. Subjects were selected from a population of healthy adults at least 18 years of age who had moderate to severe glabellar lines at maximum frown, as assessed by the investigator. On Day 0, eligible subjects were administered a single treatment, 20 units of DWP-450. On and after Day 90, subjects were eligible for a repeat treatment if their GLS score was 2 or greater at maximum frown, as assessed by the investigator. If a subject did not have a GLS score of 2 or greater, they were followed monthly until eligible for a repeat treatment or until the study ended on Day 365. The test product in this study was different from all the other Evolus sponsored studies because each vial contained lyophilized, instead of vacuum dried, DWP-450. See the section entitled “Additional Safety Evaluations” below for additional information. All other studies in the Evolus sponsored program used vials containing vacuum dried DWP-450.
Over the course of the one year study, the 352 subjects in the study received a median total dose of 60 units, or 3 treatments. 
Total AEs

• | 148 subjects (148/352, 42.0%) experienced a total of 265 AEs.


• | 7 subjects (7/352, 2.0%) experienced a total of 9 SAEs, none assessed as study drug related.

Study Drug Related AEs

• | 51 subjects (51/352, 14.5%) experienced a total of 59 AEs (59/265 events, 22.3%) assessed by the investigator as study drug related.


• | 39 subjects (39/352, 11.1%) experienced a study drug related AE following the initial treatment visit, representing 76.5% of all subjects who experienced study drug related AEs (39/51). Progressively lower percentages of subjects

16

experienced study drug related AEs following each repeat treatment: 3.4% (11/319) after the first repeat treatment, 1.5% (4/262) after the second repeat treatment, and none after the third repeat treatment.
The Phase II, EV-006 study’s primary objective was also to demonstrate the safety of DWP-450 in adult subjects receiving repeat doses of DWP-450 for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. Like EV-004, the EV-006 was a multi-dose study that lasted one year. Subjects were selected from a population of healthy adults at least 18 years of age who had moderate to severe glabellar lines at maximum frown, agreed by both the investigator and the subject, as opposed to the sole assessment of the investigator in the EV-004 study. On Day 0, eligible subjects were administered a single treatment of 20 units of DWP-450. On and after Day 90, subjects were eligible for repeat treatment if their GLS score was a 2 or greater at maximum frown, as assessed by the investigator. If a subject did not have a GLS score ≥2, they were followed monthly until eligible for repeat treatment or until the study ended on Day 365.
Over the course of the one-year study, the 570 subjects in the study received a median total dose of 60 units, or 3 treatments. 
Total AEs

• | 235 subjects (235/570, 41.2%) experienced a total of 475 AEs.


• | Seven subjects (7/570, 1.2%) experienced eight SAEs, none of the SAEs were assessed as study drug related. One death (1/570, 0.2%) was reported during the study, a SAE, this event was not related to the study drug.

Study Drug Related AEs

• | 61 subjects (61/570, 10.7%) experienced a total of 91 AEs (91/473 events, 19.2%) assessed by the investigator as study drug related.


• | 37 subjects (37/570, 6.5%) experienced 46 study drug related AEs following the initial treatment visit, representing 60.7% of all subjects who experienced study drug related AEs (37/61). Progressively lower percentages of subjects experienced study drug related AEs following each repeat treatment: 3.6% (19/524) after the first repeat treatment, 3.2% (14/431) after the second repeat treatment, and 1.9% (4/214) after the third repeat treatment.

The combined eyelid ptosis rate for the EV-004 and EV-006 studies was 0.9%. 
Additional Safety Evaluations
The five Evolus sponsored studies, EV-001, EV-002, EVB-003, EV-004 and EV-006, assessed the vital signs of subjects, and there were no notable differences found between the DWP-450 group and placebo. In the U.S.-based studies, EV-001, EV-002, EV-004 and EV-006, additional testing was conducted such as chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and electrocardiograms, and these additional tests did not reveal any notable differences between the DWP-450 and placebo groups. During the course of the U.S.-based studies, testing was also conducted looking for subjects who developed antibotulinum toxin antibodies after exposure to the drug, referred to as cases of seroconversion. There were two cases of seroconversion in the EV-004 repeat dose study. The DWP-450 formulation in the EV-004 study was not the same as the formulation used in all the other Evolus studies. Specifically, the DWP-450 formulation for the EV-004 study used a lyophilizing, or freeze drying, method for removing water. The pivotal studies EV-001 and EV-002, and the repeat dose study EV-006, used a DWP-450 formulation that was vacuum dried, and there were no cases of seroconversion in any subjects. This vacuum dried formulation was tested for antibotulinum antibody formations in 1,739 DWP-450 treatments in the 570 subjects in the repeat treatment EV-006 trial, and 492 DWP-450 treatments in the two U.S. single treatment Phase III trials, EV-001 and EV-002. If approved, we plan to commercialize the vacuum dried formulation of DWP-450.
Testing for neutralizing antibody formation was also conducted in the Daewoong Nabota DWP-450 studies and there were no cases of seroconversion. The Nabota DWP-450 formulation in the South Korean studies is slightly different than the formulation used in the Evolus sponsored studies. The HSA used in the Evolus formulation is licensed and approved by the FDA and certified by the EMA. Additionally, the Nabota product is lyophilized, whereas the Evolus product intended for commercialization is vacuum dried.
Additional Daewoong Clinical Trials
Phase III Post Stroke Upper Limb Spasticity Clinical Trial. Daewoong has also conducted a post-stroke upper limb spasticity Phase III comparator study. It was a randomized, double blind, multi-center, active drug controlled, Phase III 
17

clinical trial to compare the safety and efficacy of Nabota versus BOTOX conducted in South Korea. This study was the basis for registration and approval of Nabota with the MFDS for the post-stroke upper limb spasticity indication in South Korea.
Patients diagnosed with a stroke at least six weeks prior to the start date of the study and found to be eligible based on the screening test result, were randomized to either Nabota or BOTOX. Treatment consisted of intramuscular injections of up to 360 units to the wrist flexor, elbow flexor, finger flexor or thumb-in-palm; the total dose depended on the existence and severity of spasticity. In order to assess efficacy and safety after the treatment, follow-up visits were performed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.
The primary endpoint compared the evaluations of the changes in muscle tension values as measured by the Modified Ashworth Scale, or MAS, scores of wrist flexors at 4 weeks after the injection compared to the scores before treatment. The changes in the wrist flexor MAS assessed by the investigator at 4 weeks after treatment compared to the baseline in the per protocol analysis group for the primary efficacy assessment were -1.44±0.72 points and -1.46±0.77 points in the Nabota and BOTOX group, respectively. Both groups demonstrated statistically significant decreases (p<0.0001) in muscle tension as measured on the MAS. The difference between the Nabota and BOTOX groups was 0.0129, with a 95% CI (-0.2062, 0.2319). Since the upper limit of the 97.5% one-sided confidence interval of the difference in changes was 0.2319, Nabota was found to be non-inferior to BOTOX. As a secondary endpoint, the average change in muscle tension as measured on the MAS of both groups as compared to baseline, when measured at Week 8 and Week 12, remained statistically significant at all points in time.
After administration of the treatment, AEs occurred in 19.6% of the subjects in the Nabota group and 19.4% of the subjects in the BOTOX group. Adverse drug reactions occurred in 3.1% of the subjects in the Nabota group and in 4.1% of the subjects in the BOTOX group. There was one SAE, a radius fracture that occurred in the Nabota group, which was assessed as not study drug related. Botulinum neutralizing antibody testing was conducted using mouse bio-assay, and there were no “positive” subjects found in either group. Nabota is now approved for this indication in South Korea.
Manufacturing
Daewoong has agreed to manufacture and supply us with DWP-450. Daewoong has over 70 years of experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products and is one of the largest pharmaceutical drug companies in South Korea. Daewoong has recently constructed a facility for the purposes of producing DWP-450 drug product. The facility is located in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. We believe this facility will be sufficient to meet demand for DWP-450 for the foreseeable future. The FDA conducted a cGMP and pre-approval inspection of the facility in November 2017 in connection with our BLA for DWP-450. The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, also completed an inspection of the manufacturing facility in February 2018 in connection with our MAA for DWP-450.
Daewoong manufactures the DWP-450 drug substance in a separate facility on the same campus. The manufacture of DWP-450 drug substance is based on the fermentation of Daewoong’s C.botulinum cell line, followed by isolation and purification of the drug substance. Daewoong has received a U.S. patent for the production process. The DWP-450 drug substance production facility was renovated to comply with FDA and EMA cGMP requirements.
The FDA and MHRA each completed a cGMP and pre-approval inspection of Daewoong’s manufacturing facility in South Korea related to our BLA and MAA for DWP-450 in November 2017 and February 2018, respectively. At the end of the FDA’s inspection, the FDA issued an FDA Form 483 with ten inspectional observations to Daewoong. The Form 483 includes observations relating to the need for adherence to and improved procedures, processes and documentation relating to investigations of non-compliance with specifications for batches and components, environmental monitoring, drug substance testing, computer system access, material handling and staff training. Following the completion of the MHRA inspection, the MHRA issued an inspection report for the manufacturing facility which did not contain any critical observations. The MHRA found one major observation related to controls around sterility assurance process and found other observations related to quality control and related processes and procedures. Daewoong timely responded to both the FDA and MHRA with a plan for implementing corrective actions related to these observations. Daewoong has informed us that it believes that its responses will satisfy the requirements of the FDA and MHRA and that no significant further actions will be necessary. However, the FDA or MHRA may not be satisfied with such response, and it may require Daewoong to take additional corrective actions or other measures, require re-inspection, or decline to approve the facility.

Commercialization
We plan to build a sales and marketing infrastructure required to successfully commercialize DWP-450 in anticipation of FDA approval. We plan to launch with our own sales force in the United States, which will initially focus on core aesthetic physicians (dermatologists, plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons and oculoplastic surgeons), as these physicians perform a significant proportion of the aesthetic procedure volume in the United States. We believe a scientifically oriented, customer-focused specialty sales force initially consisting of approximately 65 sales representatives within our first year of commercial launch and growing to 150 sales representatives over time would allow us to establish the necessary relationships and achieve market presence. We intend to focus our initial sales efforts on the core physicians in U.S. cities located in regions where cosmetic practices are concentrated and where cosmetic surgical procedures are prevalent. In particular, we plan to focus our efforts in the primary markets of Los Angeles and San Francisco, California, Dallas and Houston, Texas, Atlanta, Georgia, Miami, Florida, Washington, D.C. Chicago, Illinois and New York, New York. We intend to seek distribution partners for commercialization of DWP-450 in markets outside the United States.
It is expected that upon U.S. approval, DWP-450 will be the only neurotoxin approved for marketing in the United States without a therapeutic indication. We believe pursuing an aesthetic-only strategy will allow for meaningful strategic advantages in the United States. The CMS establishes the reimbursement rates for Medicare Part B drugs based on the drugs’ ASP of both the aesthetic and therapeutic sales. Current U.S. neurotoxins manufacturers’ products are used for both aesthetic and therapeutic treatments. As a result, these U.S. manufacturers are required to calculate their neurotoxin’s ASP inclusive of both aesthetic and therapeutic sales, which we believe will cause these manufacturers to limit their aesthetic neurotoxin discounting to protect their therapeutic neurotoxin reimbursement rate. This is due to therapeutic neurotoxins representing approximately 60% of all U.S. neurotoxin sales in 2016. By contrast, we will not have a therapeutic indication for DWP-450 upon commercialization and therefore will have greater flexibility in our discounting strategies relative to other U.S. neurotoxin manufacturers. We will utilize this flexibility to appropriately incentivize aesthetic physicians to incorporate DWP-450 into their practices. We expect our pricing flexibility will continue until and unless we have approval for a U.S. therapeutic indication, which we believe would require at least five years from the start of the clinical program to complete, if we were able to pursue it. 
Pursuant to the therapeutic agreement we entered into with ALPHAEON on December 18, 2017, or the therapeutic agreement, we have agreed not to sell, sub-license or otherwise dispose in whole or in part the therapeutic option or the rights underlying the therapeutic option under the Daewoong Agreement. We further agreed not to develop or make plans to develop any therapeutic indications for DWP-450. These obligations will terminate upon the prior written consent of ALPHAEON, which consent may be withheld for any or no reason. If ALPHAEON consents to the expansion of our license of DWP-450 for therapeutic indications, we could pursue approval for a U.S. therapeutic indication for DWP-450.
We intend to establish brand awareness for DWP-450 through national public relations, social media and direct-to-consumer media campaigns. We will launch a comprehensive, multi-year communication campaign to drive brand awareness for DWP-450 upon FDA approval. We will increase brand awareness through consumer marketing initiatives including consumer electronic applications that will help connect aesthetic consumers with board-certified aesthetic physicians, high quality content and other self-pay consumers. The campaign will also leverage targeted communication channels to reach Baby Boomers, the Generation X and the fastest growing segment of the market, the Millennials. We expect our communications strategy will help facilitate consumer transitions from other neurotoxin products to DWP-450 and motivate non-neurotoxin consumers to experience the benefits of the aesthetic neurotoxin procedure. 
Our History
We were incorporated in November 2012 and are headquartered in Irvine, California. In a series of related transactions in 2013, SCH-AEON, LLC (formerly known as Strathspey Crown Holdings, LLC), or SCH, acquired all of our outstanding equity in exchange for membership interests in SCH. In 2014, SCH contributed our equity that it had acquired in 2013 to ALPHAEON in exchange for the payments described in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Payment Obligations Related to Our Acquisition by ALPHAEON.” As a result of these transactions, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of ALPHAEON.

Daewoong License and Supply Agreement
On September 30, 2013, we entered into the Daewoong Agreement with Daewoong, pursuant to which Daewoong agreed to manufacture and supply DWP-450 and grant us an exclusive license to import, distribute, promote, market, develop, offer for sale and otherwise commercialize and exploit DWP-450 in the United States, EU, Canada, Australia, Russia, C.I.S., and South Africa, each, a covered territory. Daewoong also granted us a non-exclusive license to do the same in Japan. In connection with our entry into the Daewoong Agreement, we made an upfront payment to Daewoong of $2.5 million. We further agreed to make milestone payments upon certain confidential development and commercial milestones, including a confidential payment to Daewoong upon each of FDA and EMA approval of DWP-450. Under the Daewoong Agreement, the maximum aggregate amount of future milestone payments that could be owed to Daewoong upon the satisfaction of all milestones is $13.5 million. Under the Daewoong Agreement, Daewoong is responsible for all costs related to the manufacturing of DWP-450, including costs related to the operation and upkeep of its manufacturing facility, and we are responsible for all costs related to obtaining regulatory approval, including clinical expenses, and commercialization of DWP-450.
Under the Daewoong Agreement, Daewoong has agreed to supply us with DWP-450 at an agreed-upon, transfer price, and we have agreed to make milestone payments upon completion of certain confidential development and commercial milestones. Our exclusivity is subject to certain minimum annual purchases upon commercialization, irrespective of aesthetic or therapeutic indications, and if we fail to meet these targets, Daewoong may, at its option, convert the exclusive license to a non-exclusive license. These potential minimum purchase obligations are contingent upon the occurrence of future events, including receipt of governmental approvals and our future market share in various jurisdictions. During the term of the Daewoong Agreement, we cannot purchase, sell or distribute any competing products in a covered territory or Japan or sell DWP-450 outside a covered territory or Japan. 
The initial term of the Daewoong Agreement is from September 30, 2013 to the later of (i) the fifth anniversary of approval from the relevant governmental authority necessary to market and sell DWP-450 or (ii) September 30, 2023, and automatically renews for unlimited additional three-year terms if we meet certain performance requirements. The Daewoong Agreement will terminate (A) upon written notice by either us or Daewoong upon a continuing default that remains uncured within 90 days (or 30 days for a payment default) by the other party, or (B) without notice upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of our company. 
In addition to the aesthetic use of DWP-450, Daewoong has granted us an option to expand our exclusive license to include therapeutic indications, for which we paid a total of $1.0 million. This option expires on December 31, 2018 and is exercisable by us on behalf of ALPHAEON, pursuant to the Therapeutic Agreement, upon payment of a confidential option exercise price, which ALPHAEON has agreed to provide to us upon its decision to exercise the therapeutic option. We also have the option to negotiate first with Daewoong to secure a distribution license for any product that Daewoong directly or indirectly develops or commercializes that is classified as an injectable botulinum toxin (other than DWP-450) in a covered territory or Japan. 
We will be the sole owner of any marketing authorization and clinical trial results we pursue in a covered territory. This will include ownership of the BLA we submitted to the FDA in May 2017, the MAA that was accepted for review by the EMA in July 2017, the NDS that was accepted for review by Health Canada in October 2017, and any other approvals we receive in a covered territory. However, if we do not renew the Daewoong Agreement or upon termination of the Daewoong Agreement due to a breach by us, we are obligated to transfer our rights to Daewoong. 
Pursuant to the Daewoong Agreement, a Joint Steering Committee, or JSC, comprised of an equal number of development and commercial representatives from Daewoong and us, shall review and provide input on our commercialization plan for DWP-450, although we have final decision-making power regarding the marketing, promotion, sale and/or distribution of DWP-450. A disagreement among the JSC will be referred to senior management of Daewoong and us for resolution if the JSC is unable to reach a decision within 30 days. We plan to market DWP-450 under a name approved by relevant regulatory agencies. Daewoong currently markets DWP-450 in South Korea under its own brand name, Nabota.
The Daewoong Agreement also provides that Daewoong will indemnify us for any losses arising out of (i) Daewoong’s willful misconduct or gross negligence in performing its obligations under the agreement, (ii) Daewoong’s breach of the agreement, or (iii) any allegation that DWP-450 or Daewoong’s trademark infringes or misappropriates the rights of a third party, except, in each case, as a result of our willful misconduct or gross negligence. We have agreed to indemnify Daewoong for any losses arising out of (A) our willful misconduct or gross negligence in performing our obligations under the agreement, or (B) our breach of the agreement, except, in each case, as a result of Daewoong’s willful misconduct or gross negligence.

Competition
Our primary competitors in the pharmaceutical market are companies offering injectable dose forms of botulinum toxin. There are only three approved injectable botulinum toxin type A neurotoxins in the United States. There are also other injectable botulinum toxin type A products being developed in the United States, however, we believe our product, DWP-450, is further along in its clinical development than other products and is the only product with an accepted BLA in the United States. We believe the primary products in this market include BOTOX, Dysport and Xeomin:

• | BOTOX, marketed by Allergan plc, or Allergan, received FDA approval in 2002 for glabellar lines. Allergan was the first company to market neurotoxins for aesthetic purposes.


• | Dysport, marketed by Galderma S.A., or Galderma, received FDA approval in 2009 for glabellar lines.


• | Xeomin, marketed by Merz Pharma GmbH & Co., or Merz, received FDA approval in 2011 for glabellar lines.

In addition to the companies commercializing neurotoxins, there are other products and treatments that may indirectly compete with DWP-450, such as dermal fillers, laser treatments, brow lifts, chemical peels, fat injections and cold therapy. We compete with various companies that have products in these medical aesthetic categories. Among these companies are Allergan, Sanofi, Sun Pharma, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., or Valeant, Mentor Worldwide LLC, a division of Johnson & Johnson, Merz, Galderma, and Skinceuticals, a division of L’Oreal SA. In addition, we are aware of other companies also developing and/or marketing products in one or more of our target markets, including competing injectable botulinum toxin type A formulations that are currently in Phase III clinical development in North America for the treatment of glabellar lines.

We operate in a highly regulated industry that is subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Our business has been, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of laws including the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or the PHS Act, among others. Biologics and medical devices are subject to regulation under the FFDCA and PHS Act.
In the United States, cosmetics, dietary supplements, biopharmaceutical products and medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FFDCA, PHS Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, regulatory approval, license or clearance, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of these products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending license or marketing applications, warning letters and other enforcement actions, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
U.S. Biological Products Development Process
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigative new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use, according to the FDA’s regulations, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements including those for the protection of human research subjects and their health and other personal information;


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety;


• | purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;

21


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices for the use of human cellular and tissue products;


• | potential FDA audits of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA.

Preclinical Studies
Biological product development in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs, among other requirements. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not objected to the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical Studies
Our clinical trials for our DWP-450 product candidate involved the administration of the investigational biologic to subjects under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators. Clinical trials must be conducted pursuant to an IND and in compliance with federal regulations and GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other requirements or sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The clinical trial protocol, any protocol amendments, and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent form that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase I. The product candidate is initially introduced into a limited population of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for some diseases, or when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the disease or condition for which the product candidate is intended to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.


• | Phase II. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population, but larger than in Phase I, to identify possible adverse events and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to assess dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.


• | Phase III. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, and provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, such as several hundred to several thousand subjects, at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase III clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase II clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. These trials typically have at least 2 groups of patients who, in a blinded fashion, receive either the product or a placebo. Phase III clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.

22


• | Phase IV. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the product. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase IV clinical trials.

Marketing Approval
Clinical trials to support BLAs, which are applications for marketing approval, are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase I, the initial introduction of the investigational biologic candidate into patients, the investigational biologic is tested to assess side effects and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase II usually involves trials in a limited subject population to determine the effectiveness of the investigational biologic for a particular indication or indications and identify common adverse effects and safety risks.
If an investigational biologic demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase II evaluations, Phase III clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide adequate information for its labeling. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the biologic for use in a specific indication or population. A single Phase III clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application fee, and the manufacturer or sponsor under an approved BLA are also subject to annual FDA product and establishment user fees.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologics products are reviewed within twelve months of submission; most applications for priority review biologics are reviewed within eight months of submission. Priority review for biologics is limited to those products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease with unmet medical need relative to the currently approved products. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologics products or biologics products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the BLA unless it determines that compliance with cGMP is satisfactory. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the FDA’s general biological product standards. After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, including additional large-scale clinical testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, which can materially affect the product’s potential market and profitability. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems or safety issues are identified following initial marketing. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, ingredients or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A 
23

BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as product manufacturing, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with applicable regulations such as cGMP and the Quality System Regulation. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
Biosimilar Approval Process
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on their similarity to an existing brand product.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until twelve years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. However, an application may be submitted after four years. The BPCIA is complex and is still in the process of being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact and implementation are subject to uncertainty.
Government Regulation in Europe
In the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is composed of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA.
There are two types of MAs:

• | The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure the standard 210 days review period is reduced to 150 days.


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a

24

National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
Because we are a biotechnology medicinal products company, we are eligible for a Community MA under the Centralized Procedure.
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Product Approval Process Outside the United States and Europe
In addition to regulations in the United States and EU, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing manufacturing, clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval or MA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval or MA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse
While we do not currently have plans for our neurotoxin product candidate to be covered by insurance or government reimbursement programs, if we were to offer reimbursable products, we could be subject to federal laws and regulations covering reimbursable products, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law and Physician Payment Sunshine Act. These laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:

• | the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration (including any ownership, kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return, for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, service or item for which payment is made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply, among others, to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for a statutory exception or a regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $25,000 for each violation and imprisonment of up to five years for each violation. Violations are also subject to sanctions under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, including penalties of up to $50,000 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act of up to $11,000 for each claim submitted, plus up to three times the amounts paid for such claims, and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs;


• | the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as “whistleblowers,” may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, the government may impose penalties of not less than $5,500 and not more than $11,000 per claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages which the government sustains because of the submission of a false claim, and may exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Recently, the civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Medicaid Best Price or Average

25

Manufacturer Price, improper use of supplier or provider Medicare numbers when detailing a provider of services, improper promotion of drugs or off-label uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a drug’s label, and misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered or items provided, among other issues;

• | the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Significantly, the HIPAA provisions apply not only to federal programs, but also to private health benefit programs. HIPAA also broadened the authority of the Office of Inspector General to exclude participants from federal healthcare programs; and


• | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which require that certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report to the CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians, which is defined broadly to include other healthcare providers, teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each calendar year. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”) for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Some state laws require biopharmaceutical companies to adopt or disclose specific compliance policies to regulate a company’s interactions with healthcare professionals. Moreover, some states, such as Minnesota and Vermont, also impose an outright ban on certain gifts to physicians.

We may also be subject to analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers or self-pay patients; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers.
Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
We are also subject to data privacy and security regulation by the federal government, states and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. For example, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” those independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, transmit or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state and non-U.S. laws govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
26

Environmental Regulation
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, fire hazard control, product stewardship and end-of-life handling or disposition of products, and environmental protection, including those governing the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances and biological materials. 
Employees
As of March 23, 2018, we had 21 employees, all of whom constituted full-time employees. Three of our full-time employees, including our Chief Operating Officer, J. Christopher Marmo, Ph.D., are employed by ALPHAEON and we reimburse ALPHAEON for amounts due under their respective employment agreements with ALPHAEON. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced any work stoppage. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
