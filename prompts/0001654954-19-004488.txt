ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Overview
  
  Eco Energy Tech Asia, Ltd. (the “Company” “we” or “us”) is a development stage company. We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on January 20, 2015. To date we have not generated any revenues. We have developed a proprietary growing system that designs and builds custom biodomes ranging in size appropriate for global commercial agricultural concerns as well as small local producers; delivering greater yields per meter than traditional single level greenhouse operations resulting from our multi-tier/multi-level growing system which permits us to grow a greater number of plants. Our fiscal year end is December 31.
  
  On February 27, 2015, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Eco Energy Tech Asia, Ltd. (“EETA”), a Hong Kong corporation formed on December 27, 2012. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we issued 20,000,000 shares of our common stock to the sole shareholder of EETA in exchange for 1,000,000 ordinary shares of EETA. The sole shareholder of EETA, Yuen May Cheung, is also our Chief Executive Officer, President and sole Director.  EETA is also the owner of 82.4% of the common stock of 7582919 Canada, Inc., a corporation originally formed pursuant to the laws of British Columbia, Canada on June 21, 2010, as Renergy Foods Canada, Inc. On March 6, 2012, Renergy Foods Canada, Inc. changed its name to NuAgri, Inc. On October 1, 2013, NuAgri, Inc. changed its name to 7582919 Canada, Inc.
  
  We have developed a proprietary growing system that designs and builds custom biodomes ranging in size appropriate for global commercial agricultural concerns as well as small local producers; delivering greater yields per meterthan traditional single level greenhouse operations as a result of our multi-tie/multi-level system which permits us to grow a greater number of plants. By avoiding a traditional, low-profit commoditized monoculture environment, we can increase profitability by selling a higher yielding and diversified range of high-profit niche produce.
  
  Our proprietary biodomes are environmentally friendly and can be located anywhere, including in the most climatically inhospitable areas. The Company’s technologies provide the ability to grow high margin produce for twelve (12) months of the year, with faster growing times and cost-effective energy management. As a result, clients will experience faster capital payback, enhanced profitability and compelling, consistent revenue growth.
  
  Marketing Overview
  
  We are in the process of building a sales organization to penetrate established markets with multiple product lines to sell Biodomes to property developers, and commercial growers; sell propagation services to commercial growers; sell produce to restaurants, hotels, supermarkets, and greengrocers as well as direct to consumers.
  
  We will establish partnerships with local (supermarket) food retailers, which can locate directly below a Biodome’s production area. In such an arrangement, local retailers will make product purchase commitments with the dome operators.
  
  Product Overview
  
  ● Turnkey Biodomes
   We design and build climate-controlled Biodomes with Vertical Aeroponic Growing Cabinets that markedly increase yields and mitigates the risks associated with growing vegetables, herbs, microgreens, and fruits.
  ● Micropropagation Services
   We intend to provide commercial growers worldwide with the highest quality, certified disease free, high-yielding plantlets grown in a closed-controlled environment from both seeds and cuttings obtained by micropropagation.
  ● Karma Verdi Brand: Local. Everywhere.
   We intend to develop a global network of small commercial growers interested in contract growing for the Karma Verdi Brand. This brand will differentiate itself by growing produce locally so it is fresh, and where possible, alive to increase shelf life for both retailers and consumers year-round.

  Background
  
  The following few key global issues shape our business model for the foreseeable future.
  
  Increasing Populations
  
  With no change to the 1.14%1 annual growth rate, the current world population of 6.79 billion people will double over the next 61 years to 13.6 billion. Realistically, and according to projections, the world population will continue to grow until at least 2050, with the population reaching 9 billion in 2040.2 Most of this growth will take place in developing nations.
 Energy Inflation
  
  For the developed world, conventional food production and distribution requires a tremendous amount of energy. Besides fueling farm machinery and transporting food, significant energy goes towards the production of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, and to the processing, packaging, and storing of food. Because commercial growers have evolved to depend upon the use of low-cost rural land, inefficient greenhouses, and low-cost fossil fuels to supply food to urban centers, they have not been designed to deal with the potential problems associated to energy inflation. Over time, and with an annual rate of 7.33% energy inflation, this inherent inefficiency in food production and distribution has resulted in increased food prices. Extrapolating the 7.33% rate of inflation, energy costs are likely to double in the next ten years.

  Global Warming / Climate Change
  
  With global warming and climate change, predictions4 call for the frequency of warm spells or heat waves to increase over most land areas. Other likely changes include an increase in the number of areas that will be affected by drought, floods, and tropical storm activity, all of which will have a negative impact on agricultural activities and result in increased food prices.

  Food Inflation

  With increasing populations, energy costs, and climate change, the current annual rate of 1.84%5 per year is likely to increase significantly: In all likelihood, this rate of inflation will likely increase to match the higher rate of energy inflation.
 Consumer Food Choice Trends
  
  Four primary food choice trends exist in today’s market:
  
 
● | Health and wellness – an aging population increasingly focused on health awareness is creating a demand for chemical-free foods, functional foods, nutraceuticals, and treating food as medicine.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Convenience – with a faster pace of lifestyle, smaller households, a higher rate of women working, and time becoming a more valuable resource, there is a growing demand for smaller portions of prepared foods.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Value – with an increasingly educated and sophisticated consumer, there is a growing demand for premium private label products. With increasing income distribution and gaps, and declining food expenditure share, there is growing price consciousness of lower income consumers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pleasure - As populations in developing countries increase, new immigrants are replenishing the declining populations in developed countries. This trend is creating an increasing demand for ethnic and exotic foods. In addition, consumers are increasingly looking for more variety in the taste of their food. Due to the fact that they want to be indulgent and guilt-free, they are seeking more healthy foods

  Karma Verdi Brand: Local. Everywhere
  
  We intend to develop a global network of small commercial growers interested in contract growing for the Karma Verdi Brand. This brand will differentiate itself by growing produce locally so it is fresh, and where possible, alive to increase shelf life for both retailers and consumers year-round. The revenues of growers and retailers benefit from higher out-of-season prices. The Company is also developing the KarmaVerdi.com website to process orders for this international network of growers and to promote the Brand, consisting of a diversified range of fruits, herbs, microgreens, and vegetables. Social media assets, the website, and print-on-demand eBooks will be used to promote recipes, chefs, and restaurants that use Karma Verdi produce. Revenues will be generated from the sale of Karma Verdi – branded material as well as distribution and processing fees.
 Technologies
  
  EcoEnergy Biodome
  
  One of our principal objectives is to provide food producers with the opportunity of growing high-quality food crops year-round – even in heavily populated urban environments. For this purpose, we have developed several design versions of an insulated, efficient hi-tech plant sheltering structures called “EcoEnergy Biodomes”. These custom Biodomes may be configured as single-level or as two-story structures, depending on the requirements of the end user and the necessary technical degree of sophistication. A two-story version can, for instance, incorporate a retail floor and a crop cultivation floor. Our initial demonstration Biodome consists of a growing level, a laboratory floor, and a test retail area.
  
  There are a number of architectural and environmental features, which set EcoEnergy Biodomes apart from most conventional (monoculture-type, petrochemically-intensive) greenhouses. In the paragraphs below, we discuss a number of environmental and biological aspects as they relate specifically to the creation of ideal crop growing conditions in EcoEnergy Biodomes.
  
  First, a discussion of some of the architectural benefits of the EcoEnergy Biodomes that pertain largely to the extensive use of a cladding material called ETFE (Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene). This product is a lightweight, high-strength, low-cost, transparent non-petroleum based plastic with a number of remarkable properties:
  
  ETFE has a significantly longer lifespan of up to fifty (50) years than the frequently used poly sheets, which need to be replaced every three (3) to four (4) years. At the same time, among a wide range of common cladding materials used in greenhouses, ETFE film ranks highest in terms of plant growth enhancing light transmittance (both for direct and for diffuse light), allowing transmission of up to 95% all light frequencies. ETFE weighs only 1% as much as glass, making for considerable material savings from a structural perspective. The non-stick characteristics of ETFE make it low maintenance and virtually self-cleaning. With a wide service temperature range of between -200° to +150° C, ETFE is extremely resistant to tearing, weathering, solvents and chemicals. It is also extremely flexible and can stretch up to 200% before breaking. Furthermore, ETFE is low flammable and self-extinguishing. In contrast to many other plastics, specifically those used to cover non-glass greenhouses, ETFE is not a petrochemical derivative (i.e. no solvents or additives are used in the water-based manufacturing process) and can be fully recycled. When fashioned into so-called “pneumatic pillows” (which may consist of three layers of 100 micron sheets of ETFE welded together with specialized welding equipment), a significant solar gain can be achieved inside EcoEnergy Biodomes: ETFE in a triple-layered pillow configuration achieves a U-value of approximately 1.95 W/m2K, considerably better than triple glazing. Pneumatic ETFE pillows can be filled with air and kept inflated at pressures of 200 and 600 Pascal’s. Gauges and electronic switches are used to monitor and automatically activate low-power electrical fans connected to the pillows to maintain air pressure. Maintaining air pressure (rather than creating air flow) markedly lowers energy consumption. As well, the air pressure in the pillows pre-stresses them to withstand external loads, such as snow and wind. EcoEnergy will use ETFE pillows as cladding for its Biodomes with the pillows held in place by aluminum keder tracks and compression plates. Structural movement is absorbed within each panel.
  
  A significant architectural feature of EcoEnergy Biodomes is that they are largely sealed and equipped with air-lock doors. These features limit the venting of carbon dioxide (which is added as a plant growth accelerant) and keep insects and pathogens out.
  
  Plant Lighting
  
  For optimal photosynthesis, plants require specific types and amounts of light. Inadequate lighting may stunt growth and compromise the taste of produce. EcoEnergy Biodomes are designed to use full spectrum diffused light in order to optimize plant yields.
  
  When natural light is not sufficiently available, EcoEnergy Biodomes will supplement with artificial light. Amongst other technologies, sulphur plasma lights will be used. Researchers at Wageningen University in the Netherlands reported that sulphur plasma lights produced young cucumber plants that are 64% heavier than those grown under a SON-T-light, a light source traditionally used in the horticultural industry.

  Sulphur plasma lamps provide a true, full spectrum light similar to that of sunlight. Sulphur plasma light is low in infrared energy; less than 1% of the spectrum is ultraviolet light. As much as 75% of the emitted radiation is in the visible spectrum, far more than with other types of lamps. Sulphur plasma lamps are between 25% and 100% more efficient than any other artificial source of high quality white light.
  
  Together with a leading Dutch plant lighting scientist, we will be testing a range of lighting options including LED lights to gain first-hand experience in this crucial field.
  
  Plant Biotechnology and Micropropagation Laboratory
  
  Our demonstration Biodome will house a state-of-the-art plant biotechnology / micropropagation laboratory to be located on the lower floors of the structure. This well-equipped lab will serve numerous purposes, including the study of seed physiology and germination patterns, the assessment of crop growth performance (physiology, biochemistry), the quality and health control of foods grown (microbiology), the formulation and testing of dry blend and liquid solution fertilizers, and the optimization of aeroponics nutrient delivery mechanisms. Further, the laboratory will also serve to address, test, and resolve post-harvest and packaging issues, and finally to assess the potential of new crops, such as micro-greens. A significant section of the laboratory will be devoted to the micropropagation of plants. The result will be large quantities of disease-free crops of superior quality for ensuing cultivation in EcoEnergy Biodomes, as well as for sale to the wider market. The most promising crops currently under consideration for in vitro micropropagation include strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, potato, culinary herbs (e.g., oregano, thyme, French tarragon), spices (Wasabi, Horseradish), and medicinal plants (such as Goldenseal and Seabucktorn). Specific protocols for the micropropagation of such crops will be developed and refined. Plants with nutraceutical potential (e.g., the sugar replacement plant “Stevia”) will also be addressed.
  
  A key design objective of the laboratory is that it allows micropropagation to be scaled up rapidly. We will be able to respond quickly and efficiently to an anticipated increase in market demand for its high quality propagated juvenile plants.
  
  Growing Cabinets
  
  We have developed a proprietary aeroponics growing cabinet in which crops of various sizes can be cultivated vertically in multiple layers. This growing arrangement increases plant density. Based on a variety of plant sizes, a EcoEnergy Biodome will hold between 200,000 and 600,000 plants, all in a footprint comprising less than a third of an acre (which is roughly equivalent to 1/10 ha). At a very basic level, we can differentiate two main types of roots: (1) Burrowing roots that serve to anchor the plant; and (2) Fine root hairs through which plants absorb most of the water and nutrients they require.
  
  When growing in the soil, plant root systems need to seek out nutrients and water in what is typically a very hostile, competitive environment characterized by limited, local, and highly variable nutrient availability. In contrast, in a soilless environment, plants do not need to develop an extensive system of burrowing roots to access nutrients. EcoEnergy's growing cabinets optimize plant growth by providing ideal conditions – a dark, oxygenated environment where nutrients are delivered in a spray with the perfect droplet size consisting of less than 5 microns. In such an environment, plants can put all of their energies directly into the development of healthy fine root hairs, which optimize nutrient uptake and accelerated plant growth.
  
  Furthermore, our growing cabinet design addresses a problem that has limited the commercial use of aeroponics nutrient systems: blocked nozzles. We intend to file a patent that bypasses the problem of blocked nozzles, paving the way for widespread commercial adoption of our solution.
  
  Nutrient Solution
  
  Conventional soil-based agriculture may use anywhere from 200 to 400 liters of water to produce a single kilogram of tomatoes. In a hydroponic horticulture in a typical greenhouse, the same quantity of tomatoes would require 70 liters of water. However, with our aeroponic system, less than 20 liters of water will be required to produce a kilogram of tomatoes.
  
  We will market a naturally derived nutrient solution to grow healthy and tasty produce rich in nutrients. The basic nutrients required for plant growth are divided into two main categories:
  
 
● | Macronutrients: Nitrogen, calcium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, and sulphur; and; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Micronutrients: Iron, zinc, molybdenum, selenium, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, and chlorine.


 
  We have developed and market a nutrient solutions formulated specifically for each Biodome crop.
  
  Biodome Control Systems
  
  EcoEnergy Biodomes use sophisticated control technologies, which automatically monitor and adjust plant growth parameters twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.

  In alphabetical order, control systems include:
  
 
● | Artificial Light Control System: Measures available light conditions and automatically switches supplemental lighting on/off, when necessary;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Carbon Dioxide Control System: Monitors and automatically adjusts carbon dioxide levels for optimal plant growth when the Biodome is sealed; 


● | Climate Control System: Monitors a variety of climate control parameters, automatically activating the appropriate HVAC equipment in order to heat, cool, or dehumidify the Biodome; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Energy Control System: Monitors both the availability and energy requirements in the Biodome; 
● | ETFE Control System: Measures parameters such as interior and exterior temperatures, wind velocity, and snow loads and automatically inflate or deflate the Biodomes pneumatic ETFE pillows in order to maintain structural integrity and interior climate conditions.


● | Nutrient Control System: Monitors, activates and maintain the release of plant nutrients and oxygen;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Plant Productivity System: Monitors, manages, and forecasts crop growing / harvest parameters; 


● | Video Monitoring System: Monitors and activates video cameras in and around the Biodome.

 The Opportunity
  
  We have identified a number of needs that if addressed cost-effectively, provide a significant opportunity to support a commercially viable business.
  
  Growing Environment to Supply Local Markets
  
  With transportation and food distribution costs expected to rise in the foreseeable future and with consumers increasingly interested in buying locally, there is an opportunity to supply growing environments such as the EcoEnergy Biodome to commercial growers within or close to urban markets. As costs associated to food distribution increase over time, more consumers will become interested in supporting local growers.
 Growing Environment with a Smaller Footprint
  
  With increasing populations and migration to urban areas, land costs in and around urban areas are expected to continue to rise over the coming decades. Because energy and food costs and demand are expected to rise in the foreseeable future, there is an opportunity to supply commercially viable growing environments that occupy a smaller footprint that is located in or around urban areas.
 More Productive Year-Round Growing Environment
  
  With climate change the increased risk of draughts, floods, and cold and hot temperatures will continue to impact the availability of food year-round. As a result, there is a significant opportunity to supply a growing system such as the EcoEnergy Biodome that can grow produce year-round, provide more crops per year, and enjoy the profits associated with out-of-season production. In addition, there is an opportunity to supply Biodomes to areas not traditionally used to grow fresh produce because of inhospitable climate.
 Healthier Growing Environment
  
  With climate change and the consequential adverse weather conditions expected to compromise food security, there is an opportunity to supply Biodomes that can be controlled to provide a healthier growing environment that limits exposure to pathogens, root rot, humidity, fungi, algae, and excessive cold or heat.
 Improved Growing System
  
  With the increased cost of land and need to generate profits, there is an opportunity to supply growing systems to commercial farmers that will achieve higher plant densities than currently available, allow the development of healthier roots, and that use less water and nutrient solution.
 Healthier and Diversified Range of Niche Products
  
  Because commercial growers are continuously seeking ways to maximize yields, and because healthy plants require healthy seedlings, there is an opportunity to supply commercial growers with seedlings that are warranted to be disease-free and pathogen-free. In addition, there is an opportunity to supply a diversified range of seedlings that are simply not commercially available.
  
 
   
10


  
 
  Lower Cost Branding Solution for Local Suppliers
  
  Smaller commercial growers cannot afford to brand their produce in the same way as larger commercial growers that have sophisticated websites that incorporate social media, professional packaging designs, and access to shelf space in supermarkets. As a result, there is an opportunity to allow smaller commercial growers to market their produce under a shared brand. This eventuality is accomplished by allowing smaller commercial growers to grow under contract for EcoEnergy Foods and to market produce directly under the Karma Verdi Brand.
 Target Markets
  
  Today, an increasing number of (urban) food consumers want to know where their food is produced and are thus concerned about aspects such as the environmental impacts of food production, carbon footprints, and sustainability. Our turnkey urban agriculture system will appeal to a growing number of entities that wish to tap into this consumer market trend:
Commercial Growers
  
  Commercial growers represent our largest target market; all of our products and services should appeal to segments of this large, diverse market.

 Competition
  
  Our competitive research shows that few players are developing integrative, interdisciplinary approaches that match challenging goals of plant science with hands-on, commercial growing methods specifically for the urban agriculture context.
  
  A handful of direct competitors address indoor vertical farming methods (mostly hydroponics), growing produce on city rooftops, or bringing plant life to abandoned industrial buildings. While vertical soilless growing systems are being developed in various configurations, work is often limited to low-margin leafy greens rather than tackling more challenging and profitable crops.
  
  Many of our competitors are well established, have longer-standing relationships with customers and suppliers, greater name recognition and greater financial, technical and marketing resources. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities or customer requirements.  Existing or future competitors may develop or offer products that provide price, service, number or other advantages over those we intend to offer.  If we fail to compete successfully against current or future competitors with respect to these or other factors, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
  
  Our Competitive Advantage
  
  Biodomes versus Traditional Greenhouses
  
  Most suppliers provide a single floor greenhouse design that has benefitted from small incremental design improvements over the last forty years. However, these design changes have not addressed fundamental design flaws that impact on the viability and profitability of commercial growing operations.
  
  Greenhouses invariably use glass that requires shade cloths to diffuse light and minimize heat buildup in summer, and are extremely expensive to heat in winter. In some areas, greenhouse operations cannot operate in winter months because the cost of heating is too high. When heat levels rise, hot air along with carbon dioxide used to optimize plant growth is vented out of the greenhouse. Because they are not sealed, greenhouses are susceptible to pest and pathogen invasion. When using a positive pressure to minimize the presence of pathogens and pests, higher energy costs ensue.
  
 
   
11


  
 
  In creating a microclimate around the plants, a few patented designs achieve the benefit of delivering optimum air quality to plants. However, because these systems use traditional greenhouse designs, pathogens and pests are not guaranteed to be kept out.
  
  EcoEnergy Biodomes are sealed, grow areas do not require venting, are extremely well insulated, filtered and designed to diffuse light.
  
  Growing Systems
  
  Most traditional greenhouse operations grow plants on horizontal surfaces; train plants to grow upwards, and may suspend plants to form multiple layers. Because artificial lighting solutions are so costly, lights are placed high above the plants to maximize coverage. This characteristic compromises the taste of produce. Growing horizontally is not an efficient use of space.
  
  An emerging and increasing number of companies are commercializing their vertical growing systems.
  
  Our Aeroponic Growing System allows plants to grow on multiple layers, positions lights closer to the plants, creates an ideal micro climate for plants, and delivers light directly to leaves. In addition, the aeroponic nutrient delivery system oxygenates plant roots, delivers optimum droplet size for nutrient uptake, and only uses 20% of water and nutrients used by hydroponic systems.
  
  Property and Facilities
  
  Our Hong Kong business office is located at Unit 503, 5F Silvercord Tower 2, 30 Canton Road, TST, Kowloon, Hong Kong.  This office is provided to us by our Chief Executive Officer, President and Director, Yuen May Cheung, at no cost to our Company. Through our Canadian subsidiary, 7582919 Canada Inc., we own a parcel of land at 4174 184th Street, Surrey, British Columbia, Canada (the “Land”). On July 5, 2017, 7582919 Canada, Inc. (“7582919”), a subsidiary of the Company, consummated the sale of a parcel of real property located at 4174 184th St., Surrey, British Columbia V3Z 1B7, Canada. The purchase price was $1,650,000 (CN). 7582919 received $1,000,868.70 (CN) after deduction for payment of the outstanding mortgage, real estate commissions, and other related closing expenses.
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
  
  We do not anticipate dependence on one or a few major customers for at least the next twelve (12) months or the foreseeable future.  
  
  Environmental Regulations
  
  Environmental regulations have had no materially adverse effect on our operations to date, but no assurance can be given that environmental regulations will not, in the future, result in a curtailment of service or otherwise have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation. Public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations could continue. To the extent that laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs, our business and prospects could be adversely affected.
 Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
  
  We currently do not have any patents or trademarks; and we are not party to any license, franchise, concession, or royalty agreements or any labor contracts.
 Employees
  
  In addition to our three (3) executive officers, we currently have five (5) part time employees.
  
  We file reports with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any other filings required by the SEC. The public may read and copy any materials we file with, or furnish to, the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549.
