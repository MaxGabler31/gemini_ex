Item 1. Business 
 
We were incorporated April 24, 2012 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We intend to engage primarily in the development of regenerative medical applications which we intend to license, develop internally or acquire outright from other entities up to the point of successful completion of Phase I and or Phase II clinical trials after which we would either attempt to sell or license those developed applications or, alternatively, advance the application further to Phase III clinical trials. The primary factor to be considered by us in arriving at a decision to advance an application further to Phase III clinical trials would be a greater than anticipated indication of efficacy seen in Phase I trials.
 
As of December 27, 2016 , we have not licensed any existing therapies which may be marketed. On June 23, 2015 Regen Biopharma, Inc. ( “Regen”) entered into an agreement (“Agreement”) with Zander Therapeutics, Inc. ( “Zander”) whereby Regen granted to Zander an exclusive worldwide right and license for the development and commercialization of certain intellectual property controlled by Regen (“ License IP”) for non-human veterinary therapeutic use for a term of fifteen years. Zander is a subsidiary of Entest Biomedical, Inc.
 
Pursuant to the Agreement, Zander shall pay to Regen one-time, non-refundable, upfront payment of one hundred thousand US dollars ($100,000) as a license initiation fee which must be paid within 90 days of June 23, 2015 and an annual non-refundable payment of one hundred thousand US dollars ($100,000) on on July 15th, 2016 and each subsequent anniversary of the effective date of the Agreement.
 The abovementioned payments may be made, at Zander’s discretion, in cash or newly issued common stock of Zander or in common stock of Entest BioMedical Inc. valued as of the lowest closing price on the principal exchange upon which said common stock trades publicly within the 14 trading days prior to issuance.
 Pursuant to the Agreement, Zander shall pay to Regen royalties equal to four percent (4%) of the Net Sales , as such term is defined in the Agreement, of any Licensed Products, as such term is defined in the Agreement, in a Quarter.
 
Pursuant to the Agreement, Zander will pay Regen ten percent (10%) of all consideration (in the case of in-kind consideration, at fair market value as monetary consideration) received by Zander from sublicensees ( excluding royalties from sublicensees based on Net Sales of any Licensed Products for which Regen receives payment pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement).
 
Zander is obligated pay to Regen minimum annual royalties of ten thousand US dollars ($10,000) payable per year on each anniversary of the Effective Date of this Agreement, commencing on the second anniversary of June 23, 2015. This minimum annual royalty is only payable to the extent that royalty payments made during the preceding 12-month period do not exceed ten thousand US dollars ($10,000).
 
The Agreement may be terminated by Regen:
 
If Zander has not sold any Licensed Product by ten years of the effective date of the Agreement or Zander has not sold any Licensed Product for any twelve (12) month period after Zander’s first commercial sale of a Licensed Product.
 
The Agreement may be terminated by Zander with regard to any of the License IP if by five years from the date of execution of the Agreement a patent has not been granted by the United States patent and Trademark Office to Regen with regard to that License IP.
 
The Agreement may be terminated by Zander with regard to any of the License IP if a patent that has been granted by the United States patent and Trademark Office to Regen with regard to that License IP is terminated.
 
The Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach by the other party.

David R. Koos serves as sole officer and director of both Zander and Entest Biomedical, Inc. and also serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Regen.
 
Zander will be required to obtain approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in order to market any Licensed Product which may be developed within the United States and no assurance may be given that such approval would be granted.
 
Regen has been assigned intellectual property with regard to the gene NR2F6 . It is believed by the Company that NR2F6 expression leads to the shutting down of the immune system’s natural ability to kill cancerous cells. The Company believes that identification of a small molecule which could inhibit this receptor would potentially provide an avenue for immunotherapy of cancer and that identification of a small molecule which could activate this receptor could potentially provide a therapy for autoimmune disease.
 The Company is actively identifying small molecules via a high throughput screening program that inhibit NR2F6 leading to immune cell activation for oncology applications. On December 15, 2015 Regen entered into an agreement (“Agreement”) with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (“NCATS”), which is a component of the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services whereby Regen and NCATS shall collaborate to screen for small molecule compounds that activate or inhibit the orphan nuclear receptor, NR2F6.
 Initial high throughput screening assays were performed in July to September of 2016 by the contract research organization Proteros, GMBH for Regen Biopharma, Inc. This assay is based on Regen Biopharma Inc.’s screening assay whereby the full-length or ligand-binding domain of NR2F6 Reporter gene assays are used to screen for compounds that modulate gene expression via binding to nuclear hormone receptors. Transfer of this assay to ChemDiv, Inc., another contract research organization, by Regen Biopharma, Inc. was effected in January, 2017.

In molecular biology, a reporter gene is a gene that researchers attach to a regulatory sequence of another gene of interest in bacteria, cell culture, animals or plants. Certain genes are chosen as reporters because the characteristics they confer on organisms expressing them are easily identified and measured, or because they are selectable markers. Reporter genes are often used as an indication of whether a certain gene has been taken up by or expressed in the cell or organism population.
 
High Throughput Screens (HTS) are recent scientific methods in which hundreds of thousands of experimental samples are subjected to simultaneous testing under given conditions. Through this process one can rapidly identify active compounds, antibodies, or genes that modulate a particular biomolecular pathway. The results of these experiments provide starting points for drug design and for understanding the interaction or role of a particular biochemical process in biology.
 
HTS performed on behalf of Regen Biopharma, Inc. have been ongoing as of September 9, 2016. Through HTS four newly discovered small molecule compounds which (a) can bind to the relevant structure in a cellular system and (b) show evidence of the ability to modulate activity of NR2F6 have been discovered. In addition, research conducted by ChemDiv on Regen’s behalf has identified a compound that activate NR2F6 which appears to be effective in treating autoimmune diseases with virtually no toxicity.
 
Regen will be required to obtain approval from the FDA in order to market any of Regen’s products or therapies. No approval has been granted by the FDA for the marketing and sale of any of the Company’s products and therapies and no assurance may be given that any of the Company’s products or therapies will be granted such approval. The Company’s current plans include the development of regenerative medical applications up to the point of successful completion of Phase I and/ or Phase II clinical trials after which we would either attempt to sell or license those developed applications or, alternatively, advance the application further to Phase III clinical trials. We can provide no assurance that the Company will be able to sell or license any product or that, if such product is sold or licensed, such sale or license will be on terms favorable to the Company.

Distribution methods of the products or services: 
 It is anticipated that Regen will enter into licensing and/or sublicensing agreements with outside entities in order that Regen may obtain royalty income on the products and services which it may develop and commercialize.
 
Competitive business conditions and Regen's competitive position in the industry and methods of competition 
 
We are recently formed and have yet to achieve revenues or profits. The pharmaceutical and biologics industries in which we intend to compete are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological advancement. Many of our competitors have greater resources than we do.
 
We intend to be competitive by utilizing the services and advice of individuals that we believe have expertise in their field in order that we can concentrate our resources on projects in which products and services in which we have the greatest potential to secure a competitive advantage may be developed and commercialized .
 
To that effect, we have established a Scientific Advisory Board of (the Advisory Board) comprised of individuals who we believe have a high level of expertise in their professional fields and who have agreed to provide counsel and assistance to us in (a) determining the viability of proposed projects (b) obtaining financing for projects and (c) obtaining the resources required to initiate and complete a project in the most cost effective and rapid manner.

Need for any government approval of principal products or services, effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business. 
 
The US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and foreign regulatory authorities will regulate our proposed products as drugs or biologics, , depending upon such factors as the use to which the product will be put, the chemical composition, and the interaction of the product on the human body. In the United States, products that are intended to be introduced into the body will generally be regulated as drugs, while tissues and cells intended for transplant into the human body will be generally be regulated as biologics.
 
Our domestic human drug and biological products will be subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals, an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) must be filed with the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans.
 
Phase I
 
Phase 1 trials are designed to assess the safety (pharmacovigilance), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a drug. These trials are often conducted in an inpatient clinic, where the subject can be observed by full-time staff. The subject who receives the drug is usually observed until several half-lives of the drug have passed. Phase I trials normally include dose-ranging, also called dose escalation, studies so that the appropriate dose for therapeutic use can be found. The tested range of doses usually are a fraction of the dose that causes harm in animal testing and involve a small group of healthy volunteers. However, there are some circumstances when real patients are used, such as patients who have end-stage disease and lack other treatment options.

Phase II
 
Phase II trials are designed to assess how well the drug or biologic works, as well as to continue Phase I safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers and patients. Phase II trials are performed on larger groups.
 
Phase III
 
Phase III trials are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective the product is in comparison with current best standard treatment and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase III trials may also be conducted for the purposes of (i) "label expansion" (to show the product works for additional types of patients/diseases beyond the original use for which the drug was approved for marketing or (ii) to obtain additional safety data, or to support marketing claims for the product.
 
On occasion Phase IV (Post Approval) trials may be required by the FDA. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance) and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives permission to be sold.The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time period than was possible during the Phase I-III clinical trials.
 
All phases, must be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. Each clinical study is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”). The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. The time and expense required to perform this clinical testing can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product. No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the United States until an appropriate New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologic License Application (“BLA”) or has been approved by the FDA. FDA regulations also restrict the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to NDA or BLA approval.
 
Even after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. In addition, use of these products during testing and after marketing could reveal side effects that could delay, impede, or prevent FDA marketing approval, resulting in FDA-ordered product recall, or in FDA-imposed limitations on permissible
 
The FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, and human tissue and cell products, requiring that they be produced in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) . The FDA also regulates the content of advertisements used to market pharmaceutical products. Generally, claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy of a product, or any advantages of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of an NDA or an amendment to an NDA, and statements regarding the use of a product must be consistent with the FDA approved labeling and dosage information for that product.
 
Sales of drugs and biologics outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 
Amount spent during the last fiscal year on research and development activities 
 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 we expended $ 1,149,663 on research and development activities.
 
Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws (federal, state and local) 
 
Regen has not incurred any unusual or significant costs to remain in compliance with any environmental laws and does not expect to incur any unusual or significant costs to remain in compliance with any environmental laws in the foreseeable future.
