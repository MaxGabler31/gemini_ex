Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines for the treatment of serious diseases in which signaling by protein growth factors plays a fundamental role. Our novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms of growth factor activation enabled us to develop a proprietary platform for the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies that locally and selectively target the precursor, or latent, forms of growth factors. By targeting the signaling proteins at the cellular level and acting in the disease microenvironment, we believe we may avoid the historical dose-limiting safety challenges associated with inhibiting growth factors for therapeutic effect. We believe our focus on biologically validated growth factors may facilitate a more efficient development path. 
We have a productive scientific platform and are building our portfolio of novel product candidates with the aim of transforming the lives of patients suffering from a wide range of serious diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cancer, and fibrosis. We have discovered and progressed the development of: 

● | Apitegromab, an inhibitor of the activation of latent myostatin, for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”). We also believe apitegromab could have potential in the treatment of other myostatin-related disorders.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SRK-181, an inhibitor of the activation of latent transforming growth factor beta-1 (“TGFβ1”), for the treatment of cancers that are resistant to anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Potent and selective inhibitors of the activation of transforming growth factor beta (“TGFβ”) for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. We are advancing multiple antibody profiles toward product candidate selection including antibodies that selectively inhibit the activation of latent TGFβ1 in the context of fibrotic extracellular matrix and that avoid perturbing TGFβ1 presented by cells of the immune system.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additional discovery and early preclinical programs related to the selective modulation of growth factor signaling including BMP6 and other growth factors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our first product candidate, apitegromab (formerly SRK-015), is a highly selective, fully human, monoclonal antibody, with a unique mechanism of action that results in inhibition of the activation of the growth factor, myostatin, in skeletal muscle. Apitegromab is being developed as a potential first muscle-directed therapy for the treatment of SMA. We are conducting SAPPHIRE, a pivotal Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apitegromab in patients with non-ambulatory Type 2 and Type 3 SMA (which is estimated to represent the majority of the current prevalent SMA patient population in the U.S. and Europe). Apitegromab was evaluated in our TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the treatment of patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA. Positive 12-month top-line results were announced in April 2021 showing apitegromab’s transformative potential (see “TOPAZ Phase 2 Trial Analysis” below). The FDA granted fast track designation, rare pediatric disease designation and orphan drug designation to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA in May 2021, August 2020 and March 2018, respectively. The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) granted PRIority MEdicines (“PRIME”) designation in March 2021 and the EC granted orphan medicinal product designation in December 2018 to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA. 
Our second product candidate, SRK-181, is being developed for the treatment of cancers that are resistant to checkpoint inhibitor therapies (“CPI therapies”), such as anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody therapies. SRK-181 is a highly selective inhibitor of the activation of latent TGFβ1 that is being investigated in our DRAGON Phase 1 proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that exhibit primary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies. This two-part clinical trial consists of a dose escalation portion (Part A) and a dose expansion portion evaluating SRK-181 in combination with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy (Part B). Part B encompasses five cohorts, including urothelial carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma

and other solid tumors and commenced in 2021. Initial clinical data from Part A were presented in November 2021 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (“SITC”) 36th Annual Meeting.
Beyond these programs, we continue to discover and develop highly specific monoclonal antibodies to selectively modulate growth factor signaling. Growth factors are naturally occurring proteins that typically act as signaling molecules between cells and play a fundamental role in regulating a variety of normal cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation. Current therapeutic approaches to treating diseases in which growth factors play a fundamental role involve directly targeting the active form of the growth factor or its receptor systemically throughout the body. These approaches have suffered from a variety of shortcomings, including lack of pathway selectivity, lack of target selectivity, and non-localized target inhibition.
Our innovative approach is rooted in our structural biology insights into the mechanism by which certain growth factors are activated in close proximity to the cell surface. We integrate these insights with sophisticated protein expression, assay development and monoclonal antibody discovery capabilities. We believe our proprietary platform can address the challenges of treating diseases in which growth factors play a fundamental role by:

● | targeting the natural activation mechanism to prevent activation of the growth factor rather than attempting to inhibit the growth factor after activation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | achieving heightened specificity for the targeted growth factor while minimizing interactions with structurally similar and related growth factors, thereby potentially reducing the risk of unintended systemic adverse events; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | targeting the disease microenvironment, where we believe we can interfere with the disease process while minimizing the effects on the normal physiological processes mediated by the same growth factors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our structural insights and unique antibody discovery capabilities can be applied to other protein classes beyond growth factors, with an aim of generating differentiated candidates targeting cell surface receptors such as immune cell receptors or G-protein coupled receptors, where selectivity remains challenging.
Our Approach and Proprietary Platform 
Our innovative approach is rooted in our novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms of growth factor activation and signaling and is designed to discover and develop monoclonal antibody product candidates that can inhibit the activation of a growth factor with an unprecedented degree of selectivity. Our proprietary platform is designed to generate product candidates that target the growth factor’s latent precursor form prior to its activation within the disease microenvironment, or tissue where it is localized, and would normally signal upon activation.
Growth factors are naturally occurring proteins that typically act as signaling molecules between cells and play a fundamental role in regulating a variety of normal cellular processes. Members of the TGFβ superfamily of growth factors, for example, can mediate diverse biological functions, including cell growth and differentiation, tissue homeostasis, immune modulation and extracellular matrix remodeling. Growth factors have also been shown to play a fundamental role in a variety of disease processes. Because of the importance of growth factors in multiple diseases, the pharmaceutical industry has made many attempts to inhibit growth factors in a variety of therapeutic settings. However, products utilizing conventional approaches have seen only limited success. Current therapeutic approaches to treating diseases in which growth factors play a fundamental role involve directly targeting an activated growth factor or its receptor systemically throughout the body and have suffered from a variety of shortcomings:

● | Lack of pathway selectivity—multiple growth factors often signal through the same or overlapping sets of related receptors, making it difficult to specifically modulate one pathway over another;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lack of target selectivity—members of the same growth factor superfamily share considerable structural similarities, making it difficult to achieve specific inhibition of the targeted growth factor; this can result in broad systemic inhibition that can cause undesirable, and in many cases toxic, side effects; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6




● | Non-localized-target inhibition—systemic and non-selective inhibition of a growth factor can block the growth factor’s role in the disease process, but can also simultaneously interfere with its other normal physiological roles.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our approach to the discovery and development of growth factor targeted drugs is fundamentally new and different from traditional approaches. Our approach of targeting the precursor, or latent forms of growth factors is based on the breakthrough discovery by the laboratory of our cofounder, Timothy A. Springer, Ph.D. of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital.
Unlike many other proteins that are produced and secreted by cells in a mature, or active, form, many growth factors are expressed by cells in a latent form. For example, TGFβ1 is produced by cells as a single protein which is then enzymatically processed by the cells into two distinct and physically separated domains — the mature growth factor and the remaining portion of the original protein, referred to as the prodomain — which remain associated as part of a complex. This secreted complex is latent, or inactive, and must first be activated to carry out its normal function in a highly localized tissue or disease microenvironment. In a seminal peer-reviewed publication in 2011, Dr. Springer elucidated a new understanding of the mechanism of activation of the latent growth factor complex among members of the TGFβ superfamily by solving a high resolution x-ray crystal structure of this latent form of TGFβ1 (as illustrated in the graphic below).

Structural representation of the latent form of TGFβ1
wherein the prodomain wraps around the active growth factor
This research explained at a molecular level why the secreted form of TGFβ1 is inactive. The prodomain, though physically separated from the mature growth factor domain, forms a “cage” around the active form of TGFβ1, blocking the growth factor from signaling through its receptor. Only when the cage is “unlocked” by a precursor activation event can the growth factor be released and mediate its effects in the local microenvironment. Dr. Springer further hypothesized that this phenomenon likely holds true for most members of the TGFβ superfamily, though the exact nature of the activation event, such as integrin binding or enzymatic cleavage, may differ among members of the superfamily. Importantly, while many growth factors are structurally very similar, their cages are structurally diverse, and this provides the basis for our approach to improved selectivity.

We believe that there are several important advantages to our approach of targeting the precursor, or latent, forms of growth factors over conventional therapeutic approaches, which inhibit mature growth factors or their receptors systemically throughout the body:

● | targeting the latent precursor allows intervention at the site of action, within the microenvironment of the diseased tissue. Because our antibodies specifically bind the latent forms of the growth factors, we can prevent the activation of the growth factors. Given that many growth factors act primarily within the microenvironment where they are activated, as opposed to exerting their effects systemically, we believe that prevention of activation is a preferred mode of action for achieving improved outcomes. In contrast, traditional approaches to targeting growth factor signaling are focused on inhibiting the growth factor after it has been activated and released systemically;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | targeting the latent precursor allows heightened selectivity among structurally related growth factors, which we believe could limit off-target effects. For example, two members of the TGFβ superfamily, myostatin and GDF11, are 90% identical in their growth factor domains. Therefore, many of the traditional inhibitors that target myostatin also inadvertently inhibit GDF11. Similarly, most of the known inhibitors of TGFβ are pan-inhibitors, meaning that they do not distinguish among the three isoforms of TGFβ, namely, TGFβ1, TGFβ 2 and TGFβ3. Despite the sequence similarities of the active forms of these growth factors, their cages are structurally diverse. We have been able to harness this diversity to generate antibodies that specifically bind the inactive growth factor precursors and inhibit activation of a particular growth factor of interest, but not others that are closely related; and

● | targeting these precursor forms in the disease microenvironment, we believe we can interfere with the disease process while minimizing the effects on the normal physiological processes mediated by growth factors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To enable our novel approach, we have built a proprietary platform that is rooted in our structural biology insights into activation of latent growth factor precursors. We integrate these insights with sophisticated protein expression, assay development and monoclonal antibody discovery capabilities. In addition to such know-how, our proprietary platform is covered by two patent families, with issued patents projected to expire well into the 2030s, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions. The key elements of our proprietary platform include the following:

● | focusing on growth factor targets with a high degree of evidence implicating them in a disease process or processes;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | utilizing structural biology insights to generate recombinant versions of the latent forms of targeted growth factors, as well as versions of closely related growth factors utilizing proprietary technology and in-house expertise;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | developing proprietary assays in which we are able to recapitulate the natural activation mechanism that these growth factors undergo in the human body;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | designing sophisticated selection strategies utilizing recombinant antibody libraries such as phage and yeast display that allow us to identify monoclonal antibodies, a well-established therapeutic modality, that can modulate the activation of these growth factors without having an effect on the activation of other closely related growth factors; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | optimizing the output of such selections to ensure that our product candidates have the appropriate characteristics for manufacturability and further development.

Using our innovative approach and proprietary platform, we are creating a pipeline of novel product candidates that selectively modulate the activation of growth factors implicated in a variety of serious diseases. Our structural insights and unique antibody discovery capabilities can also be applied to other protein classes beyond growth factors, with an aim of generating differentiated candidates targeting cell surface receptors such as immune cell receptors or G-protein coupled receptors, where selectivity remains challenging.
Our Expertise 
We have assembled an experienced management team, board of directors, scientific founders and advisory board who bring extensive industry experience to our company. The members of our team have deep experience in discovering, developing and commercializing therapeutics, having worked at companies such as: Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Avila Therapeutics, Inc.; Dyax Corp.; AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc; Ocata Therapeutics, Inc; Foundation Medicine, Inc.; Merck; and Pfizer Inc. We were founded by internationally respected scientists, Drs. Timothy A. Springer and Leonard I. Zon of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital.
Our Strategy 
Using our proprietary platform to unlock the therapeutic potential of targeting growth factor signaling in the disease microenvironment, our goal is to deliver novel therapies to underserved patients suffering from a wide range of serious diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cancer and fibrosis. To achieve this goal, we plan to:

● | Continue advancing apitegromab in its registrational program in SMA and offer meaningful benefit to patients. We are developing our first product candidate, apitegromab, for the treatment of patients with SMA. By targeting the latent form of myostatin and specifically inhibiting its activation in muscle, we believe apitegromab holds considerable promise in improving motor function in patients with SMA. We are currently conducting SAPPHIRE, a pivotal Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apitegromab in patients with non-ambulatory Type 2 and Type 3 SMA being treated with background survival motor neuron (“SMN”) upregulator therapy (e.g., therapies that upregulate the expression of SMN, such as SMN splicing modulators). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Identify the next indication(s) for apitegromab. Our goal is to maximize the value of apitegromab by exploring its potential across SMA types and in other myostatin-related indications. We believe that the role of apitegromab as a muscle-directed therapy could have broad potential beyond SMA, spanning a number of muscle disorders in which fast-twitch fibers may play an important role in motor function. There is also increasing recognition of the important role of skeletal muscle in modulating metabolic physiology, highlighting a potential therapeutic opportunity for myostatin blockade. We have efforts underway to evaluate these opportunities, including preclinical and translational research, development path assessments, and commercial evaluations. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advance our TGFβ1 product candidate, SRK-181, through clinical proof-of-concept. Our second antibody program is focused on the discovery and development of potent and selective inhibitors of the activation of latent TGFβ1. We believe that the selectivity of SRK-181 is a significant differentiator in our efforts to address the historical dose-limiting safety challenges resulting from non-selectively inhibiting multiple isoforms that activate the TGFβ signaling pathway. We are conducting a Phase 1 proof-of-concept clinical trial of SRK-181 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are experiencing primary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy. Additionally, we believe that SRK-181 has the potential to address unmet medical needs in other oncology indications, and we will endeavor to maximize the value of this product candidate by exploring its potential in additional oncology indications. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advance additional TGFβ program candidates in non-oncology indications. We believe that additional product candidates in the TGFβ portfolio have the potential to address other disorders associated with increased TGFβ signaling, including tissue and organ fibrosis. To advance the discovery and development of selected inhibitors originating from our TGFβ program that we believe have the potential to address unmet medical needs in non-oncology indications, we entered into a three-year fibrosis-focused collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”) which concluded in December 2021. We have identified a suite of anti-fibrotic

antibodies with novel selectivity profiles that were discovered over the course of the collaboration including those which may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of organ fibrosis by inhibiting TGFβ1 function in connective tissue while having no impact on the activation or signaling of TGFβ1 in the immune system. We plan to continue the advancement of these assets as part of our growing preclinical pipeline.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Continue to leverage our proprietary platform to expand our pipeline beyond current lead programs. We will continue to leverage and expand our proprietary platform to selectively target the activation of additional growth factors, both within and beyond the TGFβ superfamily. Given the established role of signaling by protein growth factors in numerous diseases, we believe that these efforts could result in new opportunities to treat diseases with unmet medical need. In order to support our pipeline expansion and intention to be the leader in the field of growth factor-targeted drug development, we are investing in the technologies supporting our proprietary platform. We have designed a proprietary, state of the art antibody display library, to more efficiently identify differentiated candidate antibodies. Furthermore, we believe that our structural insights have applicability beyond growth factor activation to include other cell signaling mechanisms. Using our structural insight, we have identified modulators of bone morphogenic protein 6 (a TGFβ superfamily growth factor) by selectively inhibiting its co-receptor RGMc or hemojuvelin which is required for activation. BMP6 functions as a critical control point in iron modulation via regulation of hepcidin. Traditional approaches to inhibiting the signaling of BMP6 systemically would likely perturb the numerous different physiological processes in which BMP6 is involved. Our approach could provide the potential for tissue specific modulation of BMP signaling and iron regulation.

​

● | Selectively seek strategic collaborations to maximize the value of our proprietary platform and pipeline. Given the potential of our proprietary platform to generate novel product candidates that could treat a wide variety of diseases, we believe that we can maintain in-house discipline with respect to our key development and commercialization efforts, while at the same time maximizing the full potential of our proprietary platform for other disease areas and indications. As a result, and as exemplified by our ongoing and past collaborations, we may seek to form additional strategic collaborations around certain targets, product candidates or disease areas that we believe could benefit from the resources of either larger biopharmaceutical companies or those specialized in a particular area of relevance.

Our Pipeline
Using our innovative approach and proprietary platform, we are creating a differentiated pipeline of novel product candidates that selectively inhibit the activation of latent growth factors believed to be important drivers in a variety of diseases, including neuromuscular disorders, cancer and fibrosis. Our proprietary platform includes (i) our know-how enabling expression and purification of latent protein growth factor complexes in quantity and quality sufficient to enable antibody discovery; (ii) strategies to identify rare antibodies that selectively bind targeted latent protein growth factor complexes using our own proprietary antibody libraries; and (iii) assays developed by us in which to test the highly selective antibodies’ ability to modulate the activation of specific latent growth factors. We have worldwide rights to our proprietary platform and all of our product candidates, with the exception of certain early-stage antibodies that specifically inhibit the activation of TGFβ1 in the context of regulatory T cells, which we licensed to Janssen. 
The following summarizes our pipeline programs:

​
Our Product Candidates and Additional Programs
Apitegromab — Our Inhibitor of Latent Myostatin Activation for SMA
We are developing apitegromab, a novel, highly selective inhibitor of the activation of the growth factor myostatin, as a potential first muscle-directed therapy for the treatment of SMA. Myostatin, a member of the TGFβ superfamily of growth factors, is expressed primarily in skeletal muscle cells and the absence of its gene is associated with an increase in muscle mass and strength in multiple animal species. We believe that inhibition of the activation of myostatin may promote a clinically meaningful increase in motor function.
In preclinical studies, we have shown that apitegromab selectively avoids interaction with other closely related growth factors that play distinct physiological roles. We observed multi-fold increases in serum latent myostatin levels in mouse models of both early and late SMN restoration and that apitegromab promoted increased strength (as measured by torque generation) in SMN-deficient mice. In a Phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (“PK”) /pharmacodynamic (“PD”) profile of apitegromab in adult healthy volunteers, there were no dose-limiting toxicities and robust and sustained target engagement following administration of apitegromab was observed. Apitegromab was evaluated in our TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the treatment of patients 

11



with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA and positive 12-month top-line results were announced in April 2021 showing apitegromab’s transformative potential. See “TOPAZ Phase 2 Trial Analysis” below. We are currently conducting SAPPHIRE, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apitegromab in patients with non-ambulatory Type 2 and Type 3 SMA receiving background SMN upregulator treatment. 
We believe that apitegromab has the potential to be the first muscle-directed therapy, which is aimed at improving motor function in patients with SMA and could be used in conjunction with SMN upregulator therapies or as a monotherapy. We have identified multiple other diseases for which the selective inhibition of the activation of myostatin may offer therapeutic benefit, including additional patient populations in SMA (such as Type 1 SMA and ambulatory SMA) and indications outside of SMA.
 Background on SMA
SMA is a rare, and often fatal, genetic disorder that typically manifests in young children. It is characterized by the loss of motor neurons, atrophy of the voluntary muscles of the limbs and trunk and progressive muscle weakness. Disease severity in SMA can range from patients who die soon after birth to patients who live into adulthood with varying degrees of morbidity. The underlying pathology of SMA is caused by insufficient production of a protein known as “survival of motor neuron,” or SMN. The SMN protein, essential for the survival of motor neurons, is encoded by two genes, SMN1 and SMN2.

● | SMN1 genes produce the majority of functional SMN protein; healthy individuals have one or two functional copies of SMN1, while patients with SMA have mutations in or deletions of both copies of the gene.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SMN2 genes produce only 10% to 20% of functional SMN protein and an individual’s copy number of the SMN2 gene can range from zero to eight. In SMA patients, the number of SMN2 genes present in their genome is correlated with disease onset and severity; patients who have a lower number of SMN2 gene copies generally develop earlier and more severe SMA, because they produce less SMN protein.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMA Natural History and Epidemiology
SMA, the most common monogenic cause of death in infants, is a rare neuromuscular disorder. An estimated 30,000 to 35,000 patients suffer from SMA in the U.S. and Europe alone. Patients with SMA can be categorized as one of four types, Type 1 through Type 4. Approximately 85% of SMA patients currently living in the U.S. and Europe are estimated as having Type 2 or Type 3 disease, although it should be noted that this percentage may evolve over time. Type 2 and Type 3 SMA will be the initial focus of investigation in the development program.

● | Type 1 disease is the most severe form, with clinical signs emerging at or shortly following birth. Patients with Type 1 SMA suffer from respiratory compromise and often require mechanical ventilation shortly after birth. Without intervention, Type 1 infants are never able to sit without support. Type 1 patients begin to lose motor neurons and muscle mass before birth.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Type 2 disease manifests in early childhood and is less severe than Type 1 disease, although patients exhibit profound deficits in motor function. Patients with Type 2 disease may be able to sit independently but they are typically unable to walk without assistance.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Type 3 disease manifests usually in childhood. While Type 3 SMA patients develop the ability to walk unaided, many individuals lose that ability over time. Ambulatory Type 3 SMA patients commonly suffer from substantial motor functional impairment, as evidenced by Expanded Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale (“HFMSE”) scores and Six-Minute Walk Test distances, two commonly used measures of motor function.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Type 4 disease is the mildest form of SMA, and its population is not well characterized. After symptom onset, which is most commonly reported between 20 and 30 years of age, patients experience mild to moderate muscle weakness and increasing disabilities. Patients are ambulatory and their life expectancy is normal.

Unmet Medical Need in SMA
We view the emerging landscape for the development of novel medicines for SMA as being classified into two distinct but complementary therapeutic strategies: 1) SMN upregulator therapy (or also known as SMN corrector therapy, SMN-directed therapy or SMN therapy) and 2) muscle-directed therapy. Despite progress in the development of SMN upregulator therapies, a high unmet medical need to improve motor function remains. We believe that the advancement of muscle-directed therapy will be necessary to address this important gap.
SMN upregulator therapies are aimed at addressing the SMN deficiency to prevent further motor neuron deterioration. This category includes antisense oligonucleotide and small molecule approaches to increase SMN2 expression as well as gene therapy to deliver the SMN1 gene. The primary benefit of such an approach appears to be to address the SMN deficiency and to modify the course of disease. Early intervention at a very young age is therefore thought to be essential to prevent significant motor functional deterioration. However, for the vast majority of SMA patients living today, this early intervention window has been missed, and such individuals suffer from severe functional impairment. Thus, regardless of the precise nature or mechanism of action for any given SMN upregulator therapy, we believe that most SMA patients will continue to experience clinically significant functional deficits. 
To address this need, apitegromab is being developed as a potential first muscle-directed therapy for SMA. We envision the potential for apitegromab to be a critical complement to any SMN upregulator therapy in patients with Type 2 and 3 SMA in order to drive absolute increases in functional performance over baseline. We also view apitegromab as having potential in the treatment of Type 1 SMA as well as presymptomatic SMA in conjunction with SMN upregulator therapy. Our vision is that apitegromab has the potential to become the backbone treatment for the broadest group of patients with SMA.
Myostatin in SMA and Challenges with Traditional Approaches
Apitegromab is a highly selective inhibitor of the activation of latent myostatin that acts locally within skeletal muscle. Myostatin, also known as growth differentiation factor 8 (“GDF8”), is a member of the TGFβ superfamily and is produced by skeletal muscle cells. As with other tissues and organs in the human body, healthy muscle homeostasis is maintained by a proper balance of growth signals, or anabolic stimuli, and breakdown signals, or catabolic stimuli. In humans, the anabolic stimuli that drive muscle growth are proteins, such as the human growth hormone and the insulin-like growth factor 1. In contrast, myostatin is a catabolic agent that functions as a negative regulator of muscle mass.
Skeletal muscle fibers are generally classified as fast-twitch or slow-twitch. Fast-twitch fibers play a key role in motor activities, such as those involving quick bursts of strength. In contrast, slow-twitch fibers are important for endurance activities. Animals lacking functional myostatin genes, or its receptor, have larger muscles and increased strength compared to normal animals. While the absence of myostatin does lead to overall increases in muscle mass, a preferential effect on muscles enriched for fast-twitch muscle fibers has been observed in animals. Such animals are otherwise healthy and live a normal life-span.
Because of its role in regulating muscle mass, myostatin has been a popular target for a variety of drug development programs. There have been two general approaches to trying to inhibit the signaling of myostatin in humans. The first is to develop an antibody, or an antibody-like molecule, that binds to mature myostatin in circulation and prevents its ability to signal through its receptor, the ActRIIb receptor. The second is to develop an antibody to the ActRIIb receptor itself, or a soluble decoy of the ActRIIb receptor, with a goal of preventing myostatin signaling through its receptor. Both of these approaches, however, have significant limitations.
As a member of the TGFβ superfamily, mature myostatin shares considerable structural similarity with other family members. For example, the active form of myostatin and its most closely related family member, GDF11, are 90% identical in the growth factor domains, making it extremely challenging to identify antibodies that are truly specific for myostatin and do not interfere with other targets. Moreover, attempts to interrupt myostatin signaling through its receptor are complicated by the fact that the ActRIIb receptor, in addition to being the receptor for myostatin, is also the receptor for a number of related family members, including GDF11, activins and other growth factors. Attempts to block 

13



the signaling of myostatin by targeting its receptor therefore inevitably interfere with the signaling of these other growth factors, many of which are involved in normal biological processes unrelated to muscle.
There are multiple examples of clinical trials demonstrating the risk of non-selective inhibition of myostatin. For example, in a Phase 2 clinical trial in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy reported in 2017, a soluble decoy of the ActRIIb receptor resulted in bleeding side effects believed by the sponsor to be unrelated to inhibition of myostatin signaling, but instead related to the inhibition of signaling by certain other members of the TGFβ superfamily known to be important in the maintenance of vascular integrity. These side effects resulted in termination of the clinical program. More recently, results from a clinical trial were reported showing that treatment of patients with an antibody to the ActRIIb receptor resulted in suppression of the levels of follicle stimulating hormone, an important reproductive hormone. In this clinical trial, the sponsor believed that these effects were likely related to inhibition of signaling through the ActRIIb receptor.
Our Solution
Utilizing our proprietary platform, we targeted the precursor form of myostatin and generated apitegromab, a novel, highly selective inhibitor of the activation of myostatin from its inactive precursor in skeletal muscles, where myostatin resides and signals upon activation. While mature myostatin is 90% identical in the growth factor domain to its most closely related TGFβ superfamily member, GDF11, the prodomain that cages mature myostatin and keeps it in its latent precursor form is only 52% identical to the GDF11 prodomain. In preclinical studies, we observed that apitegromab bound to latent myostatin with a high level of selectivity, while having no binding to, and no effect on, the activation of related TGFβ family members.
We believe that the therapeutic potential for apitegromab in improving motor function is more optimal when a given disease bears certain features. Based on our translational and preclinical efforts, we have formulated a set of guiding principles to inform indication selection within the category of neuromuscular disease. As summarized in the table below, we believe that the pathobiological and clinical characteristics of SMA are well-aligned with these guiding principles. Since myostatin regulates muscle catabolism rather than anabolism, we believe that having a background of anabolic capacity is important to drive muscle growth in the setting of myostatin inhibition. Anabolic capacity is most robust in younger individuals and diminishes as one ages. SMA is a genetic disorder with onset commonly in childhood, and the initial focus of the development program will be in children and young adults. Furthermore, in SMA, there is a significant but incomplete loss of motor neurons, ensuring at least some intact signaling between skeletal muscle and nerve. In addition, generally, there are also no apparent structural abnormalities in the skeletal muscle. The partial loss of motor neurons causes substantial atrophy of fast-twitch muscle fibers that in turn leads to many of the motor function impairments. Validated outcome measures are available for SMA clinical trials that are relevant to fast-twitch fiber activity. These outcome measures, such as the HFMSE, assess a large number of motor activities that involve short-term bursts of strength, which are driven by fast-twitch muscle fibers. These endpoints therefore measure an outcome that may be more likely to be directly affected by apitegromab.

Clinical Development Overview
We are currently conducting SAPPHIRE, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apitegromab in patients with non-ambulatory Type 2 and Type 3 SMA being treated with background SMN upregulator therapy.
Beyond Type 2 and Type 3 SMA, we believe that apitegromab has the potential to contribute an important therapeutic benefit to patients with either more or less severe forms of SMA as well as pre-symptomatic patients receiving early intervention with a SMN upregulator therapy.
Our aim is to develop apitegromab for the broadest group of patients suffering from SMA. The FDA granted fast track designation, rare pediatric disease designation and orphan drug designation to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA in May 2021, August 2020 and March 2018, respectively. The EMA granted PRIME designation in March 2021 and the EC granted orphan medicinal product designation in December 2018 to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA.
SAPPHIRE Phase 3 Pivotal Trial Design 
SAPPHIRE is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trial. Approximately 156 patients aged 2-12 years old with non-ambulatory Type 2 or Type 3 SMA are anticipated to be enrolled in the main efficacy population. Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive for 12 months either apitegromab 10 mg/kg, apitegromab 20 mg/kg, or placebo by intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks in addition to background SMN treatment. Patients receiving the background SMN treatment of nusinersen as well as patients receiving background SMN treatment of risdiplam will both be eligible for enrollment.
Additional key elements of the study design include the following:

● | At baseline, all patients will be required to be in the chronic maintenance phase of SMN treatment, corresponding to either at least 6 months of prior treatment in the case of risdiplam or at least 10 months of prior treatment in the case of nusinersen.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15




● | Randomization of patients will be stratified by both the background SMN treatment (nusinersen vs. risdiplam) as well as the age at which SMN treatment had been initiated (≤ 5 years vs. > 5 years).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The primary efficacy endpoint will evaluate the mean change from baseline in the HFMSE total score after 12 months of treatment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additional endpoints will evaluate safety, proportion of patients with ≥3-point HFMSE increase, Revised Upper Limb Module (“RULM”), World Health Organization (“WHO”) motor developmental milestones, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, anti-drug antibody, and other outcome measures.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, this clinical trial provides the opportunity for an interim analysis when at least 50% of patients in the main efficacy population (age 2-12 years) have completed 12 months of treatment.
Separately from the main efficacy population, an exploratory population of 48 patients aged 13-21 years old with non-ambulatory Type 2 or Type 3 SMA will be evaluated. These patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive either apitegromab 20 mg/kg or placebo added to background SMN treatment with nusinersen or risdiplam. In this subpopulation of older individuals with SMA, the safety and tolerability of apitegromab will be characterized, and efficacy will also be evaluated in an exploratory, nonpowered manner.
TOPAZ Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept Trial
We completed enrollment of 58 patients in our TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of apitegromab in SMA in January 2020. One patient discontinued from the 12-month treatment period for reasons that were determined to be unrelated to apitegromab treatment. All remaining 57 patients completed the 12-month treatment period and opted into the extension period. As of February 2022, 55 of the patients remain enrolled. 
The clinical trial consisted of three distinct cohorts of patients with Type 2 or Type 3 SMA and evaluated the safety and efficacy of apitegromab over a 12-month treatment period. All patients in the clinical trial received apitegromab dosed every four weeks (Q4W) either as a monotherapy or in conjunction with an approved SMN upregulator therapy. 
In our view, this approach of having evaluated multiple distinct cohorts offers a greater number of opportunities to discern the effects of apitegromab on clinically meaningful motor function measures across multiple patient subpopulations. It is estimated that patients with Type 2 or Type 3 SMA represent over 85% of the overall patient population. We view each of the cohorts evaluated in the TOPAZ trial as representing a significant proportion of patients suffering from SMA. 
The primary efficacy objectives evaluated in the TOPAZ trial, HFMSE and Revised Hammersmith Scale (“RHS”), are clinically meaningful outcome measures validated for SMA. These endpoints assess motor tasks involving short-term bursts of strength and thus involve fast-twitch fiber function. As the hypothesized effect of myostatin blockade under investigation is to drive increases in fast-twitch fiber function, we believe these endpoints are of direct relevance in assessing the clinical effect of apitegromab.
Our overall approach to the efficacy analysis is informed by SMA disease biology, the anticipated mechanism of action of apitegromab, the effects of SMN upregulators, and available clinical data on SMA. The primary effect of SMN upregulator therapy appears to be to address the SMN deficiency and to modify the disease course; thus, the key in preventing significant motor functional deterioration is intervening at a very young age. For most patients with SMA, however, this window for early intervention is no longer available. As a result, these individuals have already suffered considerable atrophy and motor function impairment. Natural history data indicate that most patients with Type 2 or 3 SMA, other than very young individuals, generally have a stable functional baseline over a 12-month period as evidenced by their HFMSE scores. A one-point improvement on the Hammersmith scale may be considered meaningful on an individual level and a spontaneous improvement of 3 or more points from one’s baseline would be a notable divergence from the otherwise expected course of disease for most patients.
TOPAZ Twelve-Month Analysis
On April 6, 2021, we announced positive top-line data for the 12-month treatment period of our TOPAZ Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial, which enrolled 58 patients with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA across 16 study sites in the United States and 

16



Europe. The clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of intravenous apitegromab dosed every four weeks (Q4W) over a 12-month treatment period. Four patients (one in Cohort 2 and three in Cohort 3) each missed three consecutive doses of apitegromab over the course of the 12-month treatment period due to COVID-19-related site access restrictions and were excluded from the prespecified intent-to-treat primary analysis.
Cohort 1: This open-label, single-arm cohort enrolled 23 patients with ambulatory Type 3 SMA. Patients were treated with 20 mg/kg of apitegromab either as a monotherapy or in conjunction with an approved SMN upregulator therapy (nusinersen). The primary objectives of Cohort 1 were to assess safety and the mean change from baseline in RHS following 12 months of treatment.

Cohort 2: This open-label, single-arm cohort enrolled 15 patients with Type 2 or non-ambulatory Type 3 SMA and who were already receiving treatment with an approved SMN upregulator (nusinersen) initiated at age five years or older. One patient missed three consecutive doses of apitegromab due to COVID-19-related site access restrictions and was excluded from the prespecified intent-to-treat primary analysis. The primary objectives of the cohort were to assess safety and the mean change from baseline in HFMSE following 12 months of treatment.
One patient in Cohort 2 was identified as having received concomitant treatment with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor before and during the study, which was not permitted by the trial protocol. This patient experienced a 7-point decline in HFMSE score at the 12-month timepoint. In the per protocol analysis conducted in accordance with the prespecified approach, which excludes this patient as well as the patient who missed three consecutive doses due to COVID-19-related site access restrictions, the mean change from baseline in HFMSE score for Cohort 2 was a 1.2-point improvement.

Cohort 3: This randomized, double-blind, parallel arm portion of the clinical trial enrolled patients with Type 2 SMA who had initiated treatment with an approved SMN upregulator (nusinersen) before five years of age. Twenty patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive the low dose (apitegromab 2 mg /kg Q4W) or high dose (apitegromab 20 mg/kg Q4W); both treatment arms were in conjunction with an approved SMN upregulator therapy (nusinersen). Three 

17



patients (two in high-dose arm and one in low-dose arm) each missed three consecutive doses of apitegromab due to COVID-19-related site access restrictions and were excluded from the prespecified intent-to-treat primary analysis. The primary objectives of the cohort were to assess safety and the mean change from baseline in HFMSE following 12 months of treatment.

Dose response was observed; the 20 mg/kg dose achieved numerically greater mean improvements from baseline in HFMSE scores than the 2 mg/kg dose across all assessed timepoints in the 12-month treatment period. The clinically observed dose response was consistent with the pharmacodynamic (target engagement) results. Both the 20 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg doses yielded high levels of target engagement (>100-fold increase from baseline), but the 20 mg/kg dose led to a relatively higher absolute level of target engagement.
Overall safety and tolerability profile:

● | Incidence and severity of adverse events were consistent with the underlying patient population and background therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Five most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events: Headache (24%), pyrexia (22%), upper respiratory tract infection (22%), cough (22%), and nasopharyngitis (21%).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Five patients experienced a serious treatment-emergent adverse event, all assessed by the respective trial investigator as unrelated to apitegromab:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | One patient treated with 2 mg/kg dose (Cohort 3) hospitalized due to adenoidal hypertrophy and tonsillar hypertrophy to perform scheduled adenotonsillectomy (Grade 2). Event resolved without sequelae.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Two patients treated with 20 mg/kg dose (both Cohort 1) with gait inability considered a significant disability (both Grade 3). Events remain ongoing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | One patient treated with 20 mg/kg dose (Cohort 1) hospitalized with post lumbar puncture syndrome (Grade 2). Event resolved without sequelae.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | One patient treated with 20 mg/kg dose (Cohort 1) hospitalized due to viral upper respiratory tract infection (Grade 2). Event resolved without sequelae.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | One patient (Cohort 1) presented with a non-serious Grade 3 post lumbar puncture syndrome; assessed by trial investigator as unrelated to apitegromab. Event resolved without sequelae.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | One patient (Cohort 1) discontinued from the clinical trial due to Grade 2 muscle fatigue that started prior to initiation of dosing with study drug; assessed by the clinical trial investigator as unrelated to apitegromab.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From June to October 2021, we announced supportive data from additional exploratory analyses from the TOPAZ Phase 2 clinical trial at various medical congresses, including the Cure SMA virtual conference, the World Muscle Society virtual congress, the Child Neurology Society annual meeting, and the World Congress of Neurology. We believe these exploratory analyses further demonstrate the potential of apitegromab in patients with SMA:

● | Time to achieving various thresholds of improvement in HFMSE scores further supported the dose response in clinical efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increases in RULM were also observed in both non-ambulatory cohorts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Greater increases in HFMSE (non-ambulatory) and RHS (ambulatory) scores were seen in patients who were not limited by scoliosis or joint contractures.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 1 Healthy Volunteer Clinical Trial Results
The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human, Phase 1 clinical trial was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, and PD of IV administered apitegromab in adult healthy volunteers. A total of 66 subjects were enrolled, including 40 subjects in the single ascending dose (“SAD”) and 26 subjects in the multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) portions of the study. Full results from the Phase 1 clinical trial were presented at the Cure SMA Annual Conference in June 2019.
Safety and immunogenicity results. Apitegromab was shown to be well-tolerated with no apparent safety signals. There were no dose-limiting toxicities identified up to the highest tested dose of 30 mg/kg, treatment-related serious adverse events (“SAEs”) or hypersensitivity reactions. Immunogenicity was assessed by anti-drug antibody testing, and all subjects tested negative.
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics results. Apitegromab displayed a PK profile generally consistent with that commonly observed with monoclonal antibodies. Drug exposure was dose proportional, and the serum half-life was approximately 23 to 33 days across the apitegromab dose groups. The findings supported the investigation of a once every 4-week dosing regimen in the TOPAZ Phase 2 clinical trial.
Mean serum concentrations of latent myostatin in the SAD were < 20 ng/ml in the pre-treatment baselines for apitegromab treated subjects as well as in placebo subjects throughout the study. Following placebo treatment, there was no meaningful change in the latent myostatin biomarker concentrations. Following single doses of apitegromab at dose levels of 3 mg/kg or greater, marked increases in latent myostatin biomarker concentrations in the serum, by at least an order of magnitude, were observed following apitegromab treatment. This finding demonstrates successful target engagement and provides initial proof-of-mechanism in humans of our therapeutic approach of targeting the latent form of growth factors. The observation also corroborates our biological understanding that the vast majority of drug target (pro and latent forms of myostatin) resides within skeletal muscle rather than within the systemic circulation.

​
Apitegromab in Other Myostatin-Related Disorders
We see potential for apitegromab broadly across SMA (i.e., Type 1 SMA and ambulatory SMA) and our intention is to further investigate this potential. We also believe that the role of apitegromab as a muscle-directed therapy has broad potential beyond SMA, spanning a number of muscle disorders in which fast-twitch fibers may play an important role in motor function. In some settings, we believe that disease-stabilizing therapy may be necessary to address the underlying defect, which can then be complemented by the potential motor function-building benefit of apitegromab. In settings in which the defect may be less severe and/or the disease may have a slower rate of progression, apitegromab may have the potential to serve as a monotherapy.
There is also increasing recognition of the important role of skeletal muscle in modulating metabolic physiology, highlighting a potential therapeutic opportunity for myostatin blockade. For example, data emerging from our preclinical experiments support the hypothesis that blockade of the myostatin pathway has the potential to reduce the mass of visceral fat, a significant driver of cardiometabolic pathophysiology. Excessive fat mass and metabolic abnormalities have been observed in many muscle atrophy states, such as SMA and spinal cord injury. More broadly, reducing visceral fat mass, or improving body compositions (e.g., enhanced muscle-to-fat ratios), may be a potential therapeutic strategy to address a wide range of disorders, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), diabetes, and obesity.
Based on this evidence, we believe a wide range of potential therapeutic applications may be envisioned for apitegromab. We are considering the investigation of apitegromab in multiple indications beyond SMA and have efforts underway to evaluate these opportunities (including preclinical and translational research, clinical development and regulatory path assessments, and commercial assessments).

SRK-181 in Cancer Immunotherapy - Inhibitor of Latent TGFβ1 Activation
Our second antibody product candidate, SRK-181, a highly selective inhibitor of the activation of latent TGFβ1, is in clinical development for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are resistant to anti-PD-(L)1 therapies. We estimate at least 750,000 cancer patients in the US are eligible for treatment with checkpoint inhibitor therapies every year, of which the majority do not respond to treatment. 
Increased signaling by TGFβ1 is a key driver of a number of disease-relevant processes, including immune system evasion by cancer cells, bone marrow fibrosis associated with hematological disorders, and tissue and organ fibrosis. Historically, selectively targeting TGFβ1 signaling has been challenging due to the inability of either small molecule inhibitors or antibodies to avoid off-target inhibition of other, closely related growth factors, TGFβ2 and TGFβ3. Treatment of animals with these non-selective TGFβ inhibitors has been associated with a range of toxicities, most notably cardiac toxicity. Furthermore, since each of these growth factors signals through the same TGFβ receptor, ALK5, inhibitors of the TGFβ receptor kinase suffer from similar dose-limiting toxicities. In preclinical studies of our antibodies, we have observed selective inhibition of TGFβ1 activation in vitro and immunomodulatory and antifibrotic activity in multiple disease models in vivo. A 28-day pilot nonclinical toxicology study in rats of our leading antibody did not observe any drug-related toxicity up to the highest dose (100 mg/kg weekly) tested in the study. In the same study, we tested non-selective TGFβ inhibitors and observed the published toxicities, including cardiac toxicity as well as death. We have also completed four-week GLP toxicology studies in rats and non-human primates and no SRK-181 related adverse effects were observed up to the highest evaluated dose of 200 mg/kg per week and 300 mg/kg per week, respectively.
In many human cancers, TGFβ signaling is associated with lack of response to PD-(L)1 blockade, particularly in patients with tumors harboring an immune excluded phenotype (i.e., CD8+ T cells present in nearby stroma but excluded from the tumor parenchyma). We have observed multiple mouse models that recapitulate the immune-excluded phenotype and are resistant to PD-1 blockade become responsive to the combination of SRK-181-mIgG1, the murine analog of SRK-181, and an anti- PD-1 antibody. These models, including the MBT-2 bladder cancer model, the Cloudman S91 melanoma model and the EMT6 breast cancer model, were poorly responsive or unresponsive to single agent treatment with either anti-PD-1 or SRK-181-mIgG1, with little or no effect on tumor growth. However, in representative experiments, the combination of SRK-181-mIgG1 and anti-PD-1 resulted in tumor regressions of 72%, 57% and 70% in these three mouse models, respectively. Furthermore, the combination treatment led to statistically significant survival benefit in all three models (See “Preclinical Evidence in Overcoming Resistance to Checkpoint Inhibition”).
Our DRAGON Phase 1 clinical trial is intended to initially evaluate our therapeutic hypothesis that SRK-181 in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy may overcome primary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 therapy and lead to anti-tumor responses. This clinical trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors is ongoing and investigates the safety, PK and efficacy of SRK-181. The DRAGON trial consists of two parts: Part A (dose escalation of SRK-181 as a single-agent or in combination with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 therapy) and Part B (dose expansion evaluating SRK-181 in combination with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy). Part B encompasses five cohorts, including urothelial carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma and other solid tumors and commenced in 2021. Initial clinical data from Part A, primarily focused on safety and PK, was presented in November 2021 at the SITC 36th Annual Meeting. 
Selection of a Potent and Highly Selective Inhibitor of TGFβ1 Activation
TGFβ1 is produced by cells as a single protein chain and is then enzymatically processed by the cells into two distinct and physically separated domains — the mature, active growth factor and the remaining portion of the original protein, referred to as the prodomain, or latency associated peptide — which remains associated with and keeps the growth factor in an inactive state. This complex is further associated with one of a number of “presenting molecules” which when secreted serve to tether the latent precursor in specific locations in the body. TGFβ1 is produced by a variety of cell types, including fibroblasts, which deposit latent TGFβ1 in connective tissue, as well as regulatory T cells and macrophages, which display latent TGFβ1 on their cell surfaces. 

21



In a seminal peer-reviewed publication in 2011, by solving a high-resolution x-ray crystal structure of the latent form of TGFβ1, our founder, Dr. Springer elucidated a new understanding of the mechanism that underlies the activation of latent precursor forms of members of the TGFβ superfamily of protein growth factors. This research explained at a molecular level why the secreted form of TGFβ1 is inactive. The prodomain, though physically separated from the mature growth factor domain, forms a “cage” around the active form of TGFβ1, blocking the ability of the growth factor to signal through its receptor. Integrin proteins are able to unlock the “cage” by binding to the prodomain of the latent TGFβ1 complex and applying force to pull the complex open, allowing the mature growth factor to be released and signal in its microenvironment. While mature TGFβ1 shares a high degree of structural similarity with its closely related family members, TGFβ2 and TGFβ3, their respective cages are structurally diverse. By taking advantage of the differences among the prodomains, together with our understanding of the activation mechanism and ability to recapitulate the activation mechanism in vitro, we were able to identify multiple highly selective inhibitors of the activation of latent TGFβ1. 
By specifically targeting the TGFβ1 isoform, we believe we have the key to unlock the power of checkpoint inhibitors and meaningfully increase response rates across multiple solid tumor types. In March 2019, we selected SRK-181 as a product candidate in our TGFβ1 cancer immunotherapy program based on the strength of preclinical data and human translational insights. In vitro and in vivo studies of SRK-181 showed that it binds to latent TGFβ1 with high affinity and high selectivity, which is evidenced by minimal or no binding to latent TGFβ2 or latent TGFβ3 isoforms. Integrins, such as αVβ6 and αVβ8, can trigger the activation of TGFβ1 and TGFβ3. In addition, biochemical evidence suggests that certain proteases (e.g., Plasmin and Kallikreins) may also induce TGFβ activation. Notably, these integrins and proteases have been implicated in tumor biology in a number of human cancers. SRK-181 is capable of inhibiting both integrin-dependent- and protease-induced activation of TGFβ1. 

SRK-181 selectively binds to proTGFβ1complexes with minimal or no binding to proTGFβ2 or proTGFβ3 complexes.
TGFβ1 in Cancer Therapy 
We believe that specific inhibition of TGFβ1 may have a significant impact on the treatment of patients in certain oncology settings. 
Immune checkpoints are cellular mechanisms that act as a brake on the immune system, and expression of these proteins in the tumor microenvironment creates an immunosuppressive environment that allows tumor cells to evade being killed by the immune system. Immune checkpoint proteins, such as PD-1/PD-L1, have therefore become key therapeutic targets in the tumor microenvironment. By inhibiting these proteins, the brakes on the immune system are released, 

22



allowing the T cells to kill the cancer cells. There are currently multiple approved checkpoint inhibitor therapies that target the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. 

A significant proportion of patients, in many cases the majority, fail to respond to these checkpoint inhibitor therapies, because they have what appears to be a pre-existing, or primary, resistance to immunotherapy. Other patients’ cancers appear to initially respond but subsequently progress. In many human cancers, TGFβ signaling is associated with lack of response to PD(L)-1 blockade, particularly in patients with tumors harboring an immune excluded phenotype (i.e., CD8+ T cells present in nearby stroma but excluded from the tumor parenchyma). Gene expression analysis of pre-treatment melanoma tumors identified multiple TGFβ-related signaling signatures associated with pre-existing or primary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy. Similarly, it has also been reported that retrospective pathway analysis of tumor samples from an atezolizumab bladder cancer trial identified the TGFβ pathway as a major determinant of primary resistance to atezolizumab. 
Our analysis of publicly available human tumor data has identified TGFβ1 as the predominant TGFβ isoform expressed in many solid tumors. 

National Cancer Institute - Cancer Genome Atlas Program RNAseq analysis of >10,000 samples spanning 33 tumor types show high expression of the TGFβ1 isoform across many in many tumor types
Preclinical Evidence in Overcoming Resistance to Checkpoint Inhibition
Using multiple mouse models that recapitulate the immune-excluded phenotype, we have observed that co-administration of SRK-181-mIgG1, the murine version of SRK-181, with an anti-PD-1 antibody renders these tumor models sensitive to the combination treatment. These models, including the MBT-2 bladder cancer model, the Cloudman S91 melanoma model and the EMT6 breast cancer model, are poorly responsive or unresponsive to single agent treatment with either anti-PD-1 or SRK-181-mIgG1, with little or no effect on tumor growth. However, the combination of SRK-181-mIgG1 and anti-PD-1 resulted in tumor regressions. Furthermore, the combination treatment led to significant survival benefit in both models.

This effect on tumor regression and survival benefit was also observed in the EMT6 breast cancer model, which expresses both TGFβ1 and TGFβ3, suggesting that potently inhibiting TGFβ1 alone is sufficient for enabling a synergistic anti-tumor response in conjunction with anti-PD-1 antibody treatment.

Furthermore, in in vivo mechanistic studies of the same tumor models, we observed an increase in the number of effector T cells in tumors from mice treated with the SRK-181-mIgG1/anti-PD-1 combination versus control or single agent treatment, suggesting that overcoming innate CPI resistance involves enhanced presence and activity of killer T cells. CD8+ population expanded to an average of 34% of the tumor’s immune cells from a control average of 3.5%. We also observed a decrease in intratumoral immunosuppressive myeloid cells – a reduction in TAM/MDSC population to 14% of the tumor’s immune cells from a control average of 47%.

​

We have demonstrated preclinically the potential of SRK-181 for reduced toxicity that has historically limited drug exposure with non-selective TGFβ inhibition. In a 28-day pilot nonclinical toxicology study in adult rats, we did not observe any drug-related toxicity up to the highest tested dose (100 mg/kg weekly) of SRK-181. In the same study, we tested non-selective TGFβ inhibitors and observed the published toxicities, including cardiac toxicity and death. We have also completed four-week GLP-toxicology studies in rats and non-human primates and no SRK-181 related adverse effects were observed up to the highest evaluated dose of 200 mg/kg per week and 300 mg/kg per week, respectively.
DRAGON Phase 1 Clinical Trial
Our DRAGON Phase 1, open-label, proof-of-concept trial is evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK/PD, and efficacy of SRK-181 administered intravenously every 3 weeks (Q3W) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This clinical trial will investigate if SRK-181 in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy may overcome primary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 therapy and lead to anti-tumor responses.
This two-part clinical trial consists of a dose escalation portion (Part A) for SRK-181 as both a single agent and in combination with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy, followed by a dose expansion portion (Part B) evaluating SRK-181 in combination with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy in multiple tumor-specific cohorts. Patients must have locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that exhibit primary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 antibody therapy. Lack of response is characterized as either stable disease or progressive disease following treatment with an approved anti-PD(L)1 therapy, either alone or in combination with other therapy. Up to 3 lines of treatment are allowed between the last dose of anti-PD-1 and this study treatment in non-small cell lung cancer, cutaneous melanoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma cohorts.


● | Part A: The dose escalation portion of this clinical trial is assessing SRK-181 as a single agent (Part A1) and in combination with an anti-PD-(L)1 therapy approved for the tumor (Part A2). Parts A1 and A2 are being conducted in a staggered fashion.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The primary objectives of Part A are to evaluate safety and tolerability, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD), and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and evaluate dose-limiting toxicities. The secondary and exploratory objectives include evaluating PK and anti-drug antibodies (ADA), anti-tumor activity and biomarkers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Part B: The dose expansion portion of the clinical trial evaluates SRK-181 in combination with an approved anti-PD-(L)1 therapy in multiple solid tumors for which anti-PD-(L)1 therapy is approved, including non-small cell lung cancer, urothelial carcinoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma and cutaneous melanoma.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The primary and secondary objectives of Part B are to evaluate safety and tolerability, anti-tumor activity, PK, and ADA. Biomarkers will also be evaluated as exploratory measures.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the safety and pharmacokinetic data from Part A of the DRAGON Phase 1 trial, we initiated the Part B dose expansion portion of the clinical trial, which is evaluating SRK-181 dosed 1500 mg every three weeks (Q3W) in patients receiving an approved anti-PD-(L)1 therapy dosed Q3W and 1000 mg every two weeks (Q2W) in patients receiving an approved anti-PD-(L)1 therapy dosed Q2W. Part B will enroll and dose patients in multiple proof of concept cohorts conducted in parallel. Each cohort is expected to enroll up to 40 patients with various locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have demonstrated primary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. Initial efficacy and safety data are anticipated in 2022.

Potential Applications of SRK-181 in Additional Oncology Settings
Furthermore, in addition to cancer immunotherapy, we believe SRK-181 has the potential for use in additional oncology settings, such as in immunotherapy-naïve patients, in combination with other therapies beyond checkpoint inhibitors and in myelofibrosis.
TGFβ1 in Fibrotic Diseases 
In December 2018, we entered into a three-year collaboration with Gilead to discover and develop therapeutics that target TGFβ-driven signaling, a central regulator of fibrosis. Under the collaboration, Gilead had exclusive options to license worldwide rights to antibodies from certain TGFβ programs being developed by us. We received $80.0 million in proceeds upon signing the agreement and an additional $25.0 million for a preclinical milestone achieved in December 2019 for the successful demonstration of efficacy in preclinical in vivo proof-of-concept studies. The collaboration period concluded on December 19, 2021 and on January 6, 2022, Gilead agreed that its option exercise period for all programs terminated which returned rights to us to a suite of antibodies with novel pharmacological profiles that were discovered over the course of the collaboration with Gilead. 
Of particular note, we have discovered antibodies that selectively inhibit the activation of latent TGFβ1 in the context of fibrotic extracellular matrix and that avoid perturbing TGFβ1 presented by cells of immune system. Such antibodies demonstrated significant antifibrotic activity in a variety of preclinical rodent models and safety at all doses tested in a non-GLP mouse safety study.
TGFβ1 in Fibrosis
Fibrosis is a pathological feature of disease which can occur in virtually all organs, characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix in the affected tissue and accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality. The TGFβ signaling pathway as a central regulator of fibrosis has been well-established. TGFβ is upregulated in many animal models of fibrosis, and overexpression of TGFβ in vivo induces fibrotic changes. Furthermore, TGFβ inhibition in animal models has been shown to reduce fibrosis in models of hepatic, renal and cardiac fibrosis. Additionally, fresolisumab, an inhibitor of all three TGFβ isoforms, was evaluated in an open-label clinical trial involving patients with systemic sclerosis, a fibrotic connective tissue disease. Improvement in clinical skin disease as measured by the modified Rodnan skin score, a commonly used measure of skin thickness, was observed, although bleeding episodes and other safety findings similar to those associated with non-selective TGFβ inhibition were also reported in this clinical trial. These data suggest that novel approaches to targeting TGFβ signaling may have broad applicability to the treatment of fibrotic disease, where more selective approaches may offer an improved safety profile. We have identified a suite of antibodies with anti-fibrotic activity acting through novel selectivity profiles that were discovered over the course of the collaboration including those which may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of organ fibrosis by inhibiting TGFβ1 function in connective tissue while having no impact on the activation or signaling of TGFβ1 in the immune system. We plan to continue the advancement of these assets as part of our growing preclinical pipeline
Context-dependent TGFβ1 Inhibitors
As mentioned, when latent TGFβ1 is secreted from cells, it is further associated with a third protein, referred to as a presenting molecule. The presenting molecules are covalently bound to the prodomain and serve to tether the latent TGFβ1 complex in a particular microenvironment. Unlike TGFβ1, a given presenting molecule's expression pattern is restricted to particular cellular and tissue environments. For example, the presenting molecule GARP is found primarily on regulatory T cells, the presenting molecules LTBP1 and LTBP3 are localized to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix, and the presenting molecule LRRC33 is found primarily on certain myeloid lineage cells such as macrophages.
​

27



Using our proprietary platform, we are also able to identify antibodies that we believe selectively (i) inhibit the activation of latent TGFβ1 both independently—our context-independent program— and (ii) selectively in the context of specific presenting molecules—our context-dependent programs—which we refer to as context-dependent inhibition. For example, we have identified antibodies that specifically bind to and inhibit the activation of GARP-presented latent TGFβ1 on regulatory T cells with no detectable binding to latent TGFβ1 associated with other presenting molecules. These antibodies are the subject of our license agreement with Janssen. 
Discovery and Preclinical Programs
Utilizing our proprietary platform, we have multiple early stage and preclinical programs directed against targets that are known to be important in serious diseases. We are discovering and generating highly selective and differentiated monoclonal antibodies against difficult targets by 1) applying our structural insights and antibody discovery expertise, 2) prioritizing human biology, and 3) embedding translational thinking early in the research and development process. 
Additional therapeutic areas and targets that we could potentially apply our scientific platform and expertise include:


● | Advancing active discovery programs for context-dependent inhibitors of TGFβ1.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advancing programs which selectively inhibit other TGFβ superfamily pathways such as BMPs via targeting of BMP co-receptors as controllers of iron regulation. This approach could provide the potential for tissue specific modulation of BMP signaling and iron regulation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exploring opportunities in modulating metabolic physiology including understanding the important role of skeletal muscle in modulating metabolism. This is highlighted by potential therapeutic opportunity for myostatin blockade. For example, evidence is emerging that blockade of the myostatin pathway can reduce the mass of visceral fat, a significant driver of cardiometabolic pathophysiology. We have efforts underway to
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

28




evaluate these opportunities, including preclinical and translational research, development path assessments, and commercial evaluations.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exploring mechanisms to selectively modulate growth and survival mechanisms among multiple immune cell types which are important in human disease including plasma cells, macrophages, T cells and NK cells.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exploring the tumor microenvironment and its critical role in tumor initiation and progression. A major avenue of communication between tumor cells and their microenvironment is through secretion of stimulatory growth factors and via cell surface receptors for these growth factors. Through the tumor microenvironment, tumor cells can efficiently recruit stromal cells, immune cells and vascular cells which, in-turn, release further tumor growth-promoting signals to remodel tissue structures and promote pro-tumor environments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We continue to enhance our internal biologics discovery capabilities including the use of humanized transgenic rodents as well as single-domain antibody libraries. These new capabilities allow us to more efficiently discover antibodies and furthers our commitment to building a differentiated portfolio of product candidates.
License Agreements
Gilead Collaboration 
On December 19, 2018 (the “Effective Date”), we entered into a three-year collaboration with Gilead to discover and develop therapeutics that target TGFβ-driven signaling, a central regulator of fibrosis (“the Collaboration Agreement”). In connection with the Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $50 million and an equity investment of $30 million.
In December 2019, we achieved a $25 million preclinical milestone under the Gilead Collaboration Agreement for the successful demonstration of efficacy in preclinical in vivo proof-of-concept studies. 
On January 6, 2022, we entered into a letter agreement with Gilead which (i) confirmed that the collaboration period under the Collaboration Agreement had expired as of December 19, 2021, and (ii) agreed the option exercise period for all programs under the Collaboration Agreement had been terminated as January 6, 2022.
License Agreement with Janssen 
On December 17, 2013, we entered into an option and license agreement with Janssen (the “Janssen Agreement”). Pursuant to the Janssen Agreement, Janssen funded our drug discovery research to identify molecules with either one or two pharmacological profiles, over a two-year period beginning on December 17, 2013 (the “collaboration period”). 
Janssen exercised its option under this agreement in December 2015 to exclusively license certain collaboration molecules for one pharmacological profile, the selective inhibition of TGFβ1 in the context of regulatory T cells, and our obligations under the program plan for the molecule and related pharmacological profile ceased and Janssen assumed full responsibility for further development of the molecules at its sole cost. 
Janssen is obligated to pay us up to $25 million upon the achievement of specified development milestones and up to $97 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones. In addition, for any licensed product, Janssen is required to pay to us up to $130 million upon the achievement of specified annual net sales thresholds. For a period commencing on the first commercial sale of a product, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest to occur of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights covering the licensed product, (ii) the tenth anniversary date of the first commercial sale of a licensed product, or (iii) the termination or expiration of regulatory exclusivity for a licensed product, such period the royalty period, Janssen is required to pay to us, single digit percentage tiered royalties based on annual net sales thresholds. 

29



The Janssen Agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis on the expiration of the last royalty period for a licensed product within such country. Janssen has the right to terminate the Janssen Agreement, in whole or in part, without cause upon 90 days written notice to us. In addition, either we, or Janssen may terminate the Janssen Agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement and fails to cure such breach within 60 days (or 30 days in the case of a failure to make any payment) after written notice is provided, or, upon the other party's bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up. Upon termination, any licensed product reverts to us and if Janssen has commenced clinical trials for such licensed product, upon commercialization of such licensed product, we will be required to pay Janssen single digit percentage tiered royalties on such licensed product based on annual net sales thresholds. 
License Agreement with Children's Medical Corporation 
On December 17, 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “CMCC Agreement”) with Children's Medical Center Corporation (“CMCC”), to gain exclusive control over co-owned patent rights related to our platform technology. Under the CMCC Agreement, we received an exclusive worldwide license to CMCC's rights in certain patent rights jointly owned by us and CMCC, to develop and commercialize any product or process that but for the licenses granted to us under the CMCC Agreement would infringe such patent rights, a licensed product and licensed process, respectively, for any use. We are entitled to sublicense the rights granted to us under the CMCC Agreement. These licenses and rights are subject to certain limitations and retained rights, including retained rights to practice and use the patent rights for research, educational, clinical and charitable purposes. In addition, the CMCC Agreement obligates us to meeting certain diligence milestones, including obligations to raise funds, seek collaborations and initiate discovery efforts. 
We must pay CMCC annual license maintenance fees of $10,000. We will also be responsible for up to $1.3 million of development and regulatory milestone payments through the first regulatory approval of a licensed product, tiered royalty payments of low single-digit percentages on net sales of licensed products in the event that we realize sales from products covered by the license agreement, and between 10% and 20% of non-royalty income attributable to a sublicense of the CMCC rights. Such products include products developed using our proprietary platform that are covered by a valid claim contained in any patent under the license agreement. Amounts paid to CMCC are recorded as research and development expense in the statement of operations. The royalty term will terminate on the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights. 
CMCC may terminate the CMCC Agreement if we commit a breach of the agreement and fail to cure such breach within 60 days (or 30 days in the case of our failure to make any payment) after written notice is provided, or immediately upon our bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up, or upon 30 days' notice if we bring patent challenges relating to any patent families licensed by us under the CMCC Agreement. In addition, we may terminate the CMCC Agreement for convenience upon three months prior written notice to CMCC. Upon expiration of the CMCC Agreement, we will have a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable license to the intellectual property previously covered by the CMCC Agreement. 
Adimab Agreement
On March 12, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated collaboration agreement (“Adimab Agreement”) with Adimab, LLC (“Adimab”).  Under the Adimab Agreement, as amended, we selected a number of biological targets against which Adimab used its proprietary platform technology to discover and/or optimize antibodies based upon mutually agreed upon research plans, and we have the ability to select a specified number of additional biological targets against which Adimab will provide additional antibody discovery and optimization services. During the research term and evaluation term for a given research program with Adimab (“Research Program”), we have a non-exclusive worldwide license under Adimab’s technology to perform certain research activities and to evaluate the program 

30



antibodies to determine whether we want to exercise our option to obtain an exclusive license to exploit such antibodies (a “Development and Commercialization Option”).  
Pursuant to the Adimab Agreement, we previously paid Adimab a one-time, non-creditable, non-refundable technology access fee.  We are also obligated to make certain technical milestone payments to Adimab on a Research Program-by-Research Program basis. Upon exercise of a Development and Commercialization Option, we are obligated to pay to Adimab a non-creditable, nonrefundable option exercise fee of either (i) a low seven-digit dollar amount or (ii) a mid six-digit dollar amount, based on the antibodies in the given Research Program, plus, in either case, an amount equal to any technical milestone payment which was not previously paid with respect to such Research Program and less, in either case, any option extension fees paid with respect to such Research Program. On a Product (as defined in the Adimab Agreement)-by-Product basis, we will pay Adimab upon the achievement of various clinical and regulatory milestone events with total milestone payments not to exceed mid-teen millions in the aggregate for a given Product.  For any Product that is commercialized, on a country-by-country and Product-by-Product basis, we are obligated to pay to Adimab a low-to-mid single-digit percentage of annual worldwide net sales of such Product during the applicable royalty period in each country.
SRK-181 is subject to the terms of the Adimab Agreement, and in March 2019, we exercised our Development and Commercialization Option for the Research Program from which SRK-181 was generated. In January 2020 and December 2020, we exercised our Development and Commercialization Option for additional Research Programs. 
Intellectual Property 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to protect intellectual property for our product candidates, including apitegromab and SRK-181, and related methods, as well as our novel approach and proprietary platform for generating monoclonal antibodies; to secure freedom-to-operate to enable commercialization of our product candidates, if approved; and to prevent others from infringing upon our patent rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our intellectual property position by filing patent applications in key jurisdictions, including the U.S., Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia, covering our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to innovate, develop, sustain and implement our business.
We file patent applications directed to compositions comprising our antibodies, classes of antibodies covering our product candidates, use of such antibodies for treating diseases, as well as related manufacturing methods. As of January 1, 2022, we have 26 pending patent families across multiple programs. Among the pending families, 16 have been nationalized, from which 15 applications have matured into U.S. issued patents, six granted in Australia, one granted in China, one granted in Colombia, one granted in Eurasia, four granted in Europe, two granted in Israel, one granted in Hong Kong, three granted in Japan, one granted in South Korea, one granted in Mexico, one granted in Malaysia, two granted in Singapore, and one granted in South Africa. Collectively, there are 203 national or direct utility applications pending or issued. In addition, there are seven patent family filings which are in the priority year. We continue to review and harvest new inventions for new patent filings. 
Two granted patents, EP2981822 and EP3368069, are currently the subject of ongoing opposition proceedings before the European Patent Office (“EPO”). We have no other contested proceedings relating to any patents at this time, but we cannot provide any assurances that we will not have such proceedings at a later date. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Ownership and IP Rights
Our earliest patent family, PCT/US2013/068613 (published as WO 2014/074532), is jointly owned by us and CMCC. CMCC is the assignee of the intellectual property rights transferred from two of our co-founders, Drs. Timothy A. 

31



Springer and Leonard I. Zon. The portion of rights owned by CMCC is exclusively licensed to us. We are the sole legal owner of all subsequent patent families we have to date.
As described, a portion of our TGFβ technology is out-licensed to Janssen. This is carved out as PCT/US2017/042162 (published as WO 2018/013939), which has been nationalized. The licensee takes lead in the prosecution of this patent family. The licensee also has a non-exclusive license to our platform technology to enable their development in the licensed field.
Brief descriptions of our patent families are provided below, with projected patent terms excluding any possible patent term adjustments or extensions.
Platform
Our novel approach to generating selective modulators of supracellular activation of growth factors is broadly embodied in our two earliest “platform” patent families, PCT/US2013/068613 (published as WO 2014/074532) and PCT/US2014/036933 (published as WO 2014/182676). These patent families are directed to methods for modulating the activation of the TGFβ superfamily of growth factors and methods for screening for a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets an inactive form of the growth factor, thereby preventing activation (e.g., release) of mature growth factor. The TGFβ superfamily is a group of more than 30 related growth factors/cytokines that mediate diverse biological processes and includes TGFβ1 and myostatin (also known as GDF-8). Issued U.S. patents in the platform families include: U.S. Patents Nos. 9,573,995 (issued 02/21/2017); 9,758,576 (issued 09/12/2017); 9,580,500 (issued 02/28/2017); 9,399,676 (issued 07/26/2016); 9,758,577 (issued 09/12/2017); 10,597,443 (issued 03/24/2020); and 10,981,981 (04/20/2021). There is also a granted European (“EP”) platform patent: EP2981822 (granted on 09/02/2020), which was validated in 37 states. These US and EP patents are projected to expire in 2034.
Specifically, EP2981822 has granted composition of matter claims directed to an antibody capable of binding a recombinant antigen comprising pro-TGFβ1 or a growth factor-prodomain complex which comprises the TGFβ1 LAP complex, in addition to claims directed to methods of making such antibodies. EP2981822 is currently the subject of ongoing opposition proceedings before the EPO.
U.S. Patent No. 9,573,995 has issued composition of matter claims directed to an antibody that specifically binds to GARP associated with a human TGFβ1 LAP complex.
U.S. Patent No. 9,758,576 has issued composition of matter claims directed to an isolated monoclonal antibody, or a fragment thereof, that specifically binds the prodomain of a pro/latent GDF-8/myostatin complex, thereby preventing proteolytic cleavage between residues Arg 75 and Asp 76 of GDF-8/myostatin prodomain, so as to inhibit the release of mature GDF-8/myostatin growth factor from the complex.
U.S. Patent No. 9,580,500 has issued claims directed to phage display library-based antibody production methods for identifying an antibody that binds a GARP/proTGFβ1 complex.
U.S. Patent No. 9,399,676 has issued claims directed to phage display library-based antibody production methods for identifying an antibody that binds a pro/latent GDF-8 complex that has been subjected to enzymatic cleavage. Related product-by-process claims are included in issued U.S. Patent No. 9,758,577.
U.S. Patent No. 10,597,443 has issued with claims that broadly cover manufacturing methods for a pharmaceutical composition containing an antibody that binds a large latent complex of TGFβ, thereby modulating TGFβ signaling. 
In addition, U.S. Patent No. 10,981,981 has issued with claims that broadly cover manufacturing methods for a pharmaceutical composition containing an antibody that binds pro/latent GDF-8, but does not bind to mature GDF-8, and inhibits GDF-8 signaling.

Myostatin Activation Inhibitors
Seven patent families have been filed to date to cover proprietary myostatin inhibitors and their use in the treatment of various muscle and metabolic diseases. Patent prosecution of these pending patent families is ongoing but relatively early. 
Two families are directed to composition of matter claims that cover our proprietary antibodies. PCT/US2015/059468 (published as WO 2016/073853) broadly covers a class of monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind inactive precursors thereby preventing activation of myostatin. This patent family is projected to expire in November 2035. U.S. Patents 10,307,480 and 11,135,291 have issued in June 2019 and October 2021, respectively, with issued claims directed to Scholar Rock proprietary antibodies that specifically bine pro/latent myostatin, including 29H4, the parental clone of apitegromab, and variants, as well as methods of making antibodies with pH sensitive binding to pro/latent myostatin. A second family, PCT/US2016/052014 (published as WO 2017/049011), discloses the specific amino acid sequence of apitegromab and is projected to expire in September 2036. U.S. Patent 10,751,413 issued in August 2020, with claims directed to antibodies and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the heavy and light chain sequences of apitegromab. The European counterpart also granted as EP 3350220 B1 in May 2021. The granted claims relate to antibodies comprising the heavy and light chain variable region sequences of apitegromab, and pharmaceutical compositions of the antibodies.
The following three patent families are directed to therapeutic uses/methods:
PCT/US2017/012606 (published as WO 2017/120523) broadly covers treatment methods for a number of muscle and neuromuscular disease and disorders using an antibody that specifically blocks the activation step of myostatin. The related U.S. application issued in May 2019 as U.S. Patent 10,287,345 and is projected to expire in September 2036. The issued claims are drawn to methods for inhibiting myostatin activation using our proprietary activation inhibitors (such as apitegromab) to cause specified pharmacological effects to treat a variety of conditions including, muscle and metabolic disorders. A second U.S. application issued as U.S. Patent 10,882,904 in January 2021. The issued claims recite methods for inhibiting myostatin activation using an antibody comprising the heavy and light chain sequences of apitegromab for various indications.
PCT/US2017/037332 (published as WO 2017/218592) is directed to methods for treating neuromuscular diseases and selecting patient populations that are likely to respond to myostatin inhibition. This filing includes the treatment of SMA in patients who are on an SMN corrector therapy (e.g., SMN upregulators). This patent family is projected to expire in June 2037. The PCT application was nationalized in 11 jurisdictions, and applications in the three key jurisdictions (i.e., U.S., Europe and Japan) have granted. Specifically, the U.S. application granted in May of 2021. The granted claims are directed to add-on or combination therapy for treating spinal muscular atrophy with a myostatin inhibitor and a neuronal corrector (such as smn upregulator therapy). Similar claims have also granted in Japan (JP Patent No. 6823167). Likewise, the European counterpart granted as EP 3368069B1, and has been validated in 37 states. The granted European claims are directed to add-on therapy and combination therapy for the treatment of SMA using a myostatin-selective inhibitor, in conjunction with an SMN corrector therapy. EP 3368069B1 is currently the subject of ongoing opposition proceedings before the EPO.
PCT/US2018/012686 (published as WO 2018/129395) relates to the treatment of metabolic diseases with a myostatin activation inhibitor and is projected to expire in January 2038. The PCT was nationalized in 2019 and is in the early stages of prosecution. A US patent issued in October of 2021 as US 11,155,611, with claims directed to methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising a myostatin-selective inhibitor, comprising screening for an antibody that is capable of decreasing expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) and increasing expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 (PDP1). 
In addition to the five pending patent families listed above, there is also a recently-filed PCT application directed to inventions deriving from the phase 2 clinical trial of apitegromab. Moreover, issued claims of U.S. Patent 9,758,576 from the platform patents discussed in detail above cover monoclonal antibodies that selectively inhibit myostatin signaling by blocking the proteolytic activation of latent myostatin. These issued composition of matter claims provide 

33



protection for our first antibody apitegromab, as well as any other monoclonal antibodies that work by this unique mechanism of action. This patent expires in May 2034, not including any potential patent term extension.
TGFβ1 Activation Inhibitors
In addition to the patent families discussed above in the “Intellectual Property-Platform” section that generically cover certain aspects of the TGFβ1 program, thirteen patent families have been filed to date, covering various specific aspects of our TGFβ1 program. 
Isoform-specific inhibitors of TGFβ1 which confer improved safety profile and related methods are described in PCT/US2017/021972 (published as WO 2017/156500). This family is projected to expire in March 2037. Among TGFβ1 inhibitors, one of our context-independent antibodies is separately claimed and related preclinical data are described in PCT/US2018/012601 (published as WO 2018/129329). This patent application is projected to expire in January 2038. 
In addition, high-affinity, isoform-selective TGFβ1 inhibitors are disclosed in PCT/2019/041373 (published as WO US2020/014460). Patents of this family are projected to expire in 2039. Separately, three direct national/regional applications covering related subject matter have been filed, in the U.S., Europe and Hong Kong, and are projected to expire in 2039. A US patent issued in September of 2021 as US 11,130,803, with claims which cover the SRK-181 clinical candidate and pharmaceutical compositions thereof; and a European patent issued in November of 2021 as EP3677278, with claims that cover the SRK-181 clinical candidate, pharmaceutical compositions, use for treating cancer and myelofibrosis, and methods for manufacturing. Additionally, PCT/US2021/012969 (published as WO 2021/142448) discloses data related to biomarkers for the high-affinity, isoform-selective TGFβ1 inhibitors and is projected to expire in 2041. Antibodies claimed in these patent families protect our SRK-181 clinical candidate.
Separately, other improved isoform-selective, context-independent inhibitors of TGFβ1 are disclosed in PCT/US2019/041390 (published as WO 2020/014473). This family is projected to expire in 2039. PCT/US2021/12930 (published as WO 2021/142427) is directed to optimized isoform-selective, context-independent inhibitors of TGFβ1. This family is projected to expire in 2041. 
LTBP complex-specific inhibitors of TGFβ1 are described in two patent families: PCT/US2018/44216 (published as WO 2019/023661) which is expected to expire in July of 2038; and PCT/US2020/15915 (published as WO2020/160291), which is expected to expire in 2040. A US patent has been allowed in the second patent family with claims directed to antibodies and pharmaceutical compositions. 
LRRC33-specific inhibitors are described in a further patent family: PCT/US2018/031759 (published as WO 2018/208888) which is expected to expire in May of 2038. A second patent family has been filed and is in the priority year, which will be converted to international patent application (PCT) in July of 2022.
PCT/US2017/042162 (published as WO 2018/013939) is a collaboration patent family exclusively licensed to Janssen. This patent family covers antibodies that specifically inhibit GARP-associated TGFβ, and is projected to expire in July 2037. Janssen takes prosecution lead in this case.
Finally, four other TGFβ patent families have been filed and are in the priority year.
RGMc-Selective Inhibitors
PCT/US2019/57687 (published as WO2020/86736) is directed to RGMc-selective inhibitors and will expire in 2039. A second family has been filed and is in the priority year, which will be converted to international patent application (PCT) in October of 2022.

Intellectual Property Protection
We cannot predict whether the patent applications we pursue will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide any proprietary protection from competitors. Even if our pending patent applications are granted as issued patents, those patents, as well as any patents we license from third parties, may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. As mentioned above, two granted patents, EP2981822 and EP3368069, are currently the subject of ongoing opposition proceedings before the EPO. While there are currently no contested proceedings or third-party claims relating to any of the other patents described above, we cannot provide any assurances that we will not have such proceedings or third-party claims at a later date.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug or biologic is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug or biologic may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug or biologic or provide an additional period of protection for the approved pharmaceutical product following expiry of the patent. In the future, if our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in the U.S. and the national patent offices in Europe, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, product candidates and research programs, we also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. For example, certain elements of our proprietary platform may be based on unpatented trade secrets that are not publicly disclosed. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. We have also adopted policies and conduct training that provides guidance on our expectations, and our advice for best practices, in protecting our trade secrets.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate facilities for clinical drug manufacturing, storage, distribution or quality testing. Currently, all of our clinical manufacturing is outsourced to third-party manufacturers. As our development programs expand and we build new process efficiencies, we expect to continually evaluate this strategy with the objective of satisfying demand for registration trials and, if approved, the manufacture, sale and distribution of commercial products.

Antibody Discovery
We have built and internalized antibody display and discovery capability, however at times we may continue to rely on third parties to conduct antibody discovery and optimization based on criteria and specifications provided by us. Certain antibody discovery and optimization vendors require us to enter into a license with them for the right to use antibodies discovered by them in humans or for commercial purposes. Such license could include substantial milestone payments and royalties to the extent we choose to use an antibody discovered by such vendor. On March 12, 2019, we exercised an option to receive such a license from Adimab pursuant to our Adimab Agreement. Please see the description above in “License Agreements – Adimab Agreement” for more details on the terms of this agreement.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition, and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that our product candidates, discovery programs, technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others.
Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize could compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products.
In the SMA market, there are three approved SMN-directed treatments and no approved muscle-directed treatments for SMA to date. We believe that it will take several treatment approaches to holistically treat SMA. The SMA drug development pipeline reflects that, wherein existing companies are looking to enhance their current offering or SMA portfolio, newer companies to the field, such as Scholar Rock, are researching novel approaches to target systems and processes adversely impacted by SMA to help slow the disease progression.
In October 2021, Roche announced the initiation of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial to investigate RO7204239, an anti-myostatin antibody targeting the muscles in SMA patients. This announcement follows the approval of Roche’s SMN directed treatment. We may face direct competition from products within the muscle-directed therapy category in the future as the SMA market evolves to these new treatment approaches.
In terms of indirect competition, existing companies like Novartis continue plans to study an alternate formulation of their existing gene therapy (OAV101) after a partial clinical trial hold last year. Biogen continues expanding their SMA pipeline with the recent licensing of another antisense oligonucleotide (BIIB115) that may have the potential for extending dosing intervals, in addition to their Phase 1 investigational agent (BIIB110) that is intended to work in part through inhibition of the myostatin signaling pathway. In addition, Cytokinetics, Inc. has completed a Phase 2 clinical trial with reldesemtiv, a fast-skeletal muscle troponin activator (“FSTA”) in SMA.
Our competitors for SRK-181 may include other companies developing cancer immunotherapies to be used in combination with CPI therapy. Novartis’s NIS793, an anti-TGF-β IgG2 monoclonal antibody licensed from Xoma, is currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic ductal carcinoma (mPDAC) in combination with chemotherapy as well as multiple early-stage clinical studies in a variety of solid tumor types and myelofibrosis. 
Other companies, including Merck KGaA, Merck (acquired Tilos Therapeutics), Roche, Sanofi S.A., Bristol Meyers Squibb (acquired Forbius), Gilead and AbbVie Inc. are developing therapies for cancer immunotherapy in combination with CPI therapy, that are intended to work, at least in part, through inhibition of the TGFβ signaling pathway.
Our competitors may also include companies that are or will be developing therapies for the same therapeutic areas that we are targeting within our early pipeline, including other neuromuscular disorders, cancer and fibrosis.
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining 

36



qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, such as apitegromab, SRK-181 and any future product candidates. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Biological Product Development
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and its implementing regulations and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Apitegromab, SRK-181, and any future product candidates regulated as biologics must be approved by the FDA through a Biologics License Application (“BLA”), process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process generally involves the following:

● | Completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice (“GLP”) requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Manufacture of drug substance and drug product in accordance with applicable regulations, including manufacturing activities performed in accordance with good manufacturing practice (“GMP”) requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission of a BLA to the FDA;
--+--------------------------------


● | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the filing for review;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

37




● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biologic in the U.S.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for apitegromab, SRK-181 and any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
Preclinical Studies and IND
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies.
An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all patients provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. 

38



Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may be combined or overlap.

● | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2 clinical trials generally involve studies in disease-affected patients to evaluate proof of concept and/or determine the dosing regimen(s) for subsequent investigations. At the same time, safety and further PK and PD information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
FDA Review Process
Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. The BLA is a request for approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational 

39



product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the U.S.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file (“RTF”) by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an Approval Letter or a Complete Response Letter. An Approval Letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan 

40



exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union (“EU”) has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits. 
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation
The FDA grants Rare Pediatric Disease designation for serious and life-threatening diseases that primarily affect children ages 18 years or younger and fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Eligibility for a priority review voucher may be issued upon approval of a biologics license application (“BLA”) or New Drug Application for therapies developed to treat such rare pediatric diseases. Priority review vouchers may be redeemed to obtain priority review for any subsequent marketing application or be sold or transferred.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for Fast Track status any time before receiving BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-BLA meeting. Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”), that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA currently requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. If the FDA determines that the conditions of approval are not being met, the FDA can withdraw its accelerated approval for such drug or biologic.
Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as Fast Track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program.
Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.

41



Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), as amended, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”) within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
Post-marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, including a REMS or the conduct of post-marketing studies to assess a newly discovered safety issue. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws, as well as applicable tracking and tracing requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including recall.

42



Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the U.S. in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the Department of Justice, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
Other Healthcare Laws
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In particular, the research of our product candidates, as well as the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials. In the U.S., these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.

● | The Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for among other things, any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by individual imprisonment, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act (“FCA”), which prohibits individuals or entities (including prescription drug manufacturers) from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA. Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this these laws.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, which impose, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates, which include individuals or entities that perform services for covered entities involving the creation, use, maintenance or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.

● | The U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”), enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), which impose new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), non-physician providers (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, among others), and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor. Such laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures. Some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Many states in which we operate have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to sensitive and personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Further, in some cases where we process sensitive and personal information of individuals from numerous states, we may find it necessary to comply with the most stringent state laws applicable to any of the information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households, went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General will commence enforcement actions against violators beginning July 1, 2020. While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA, as currently written, the CCPA may impact our business activities. The California Attorney General has proposed draft regulations, which have not been finalized to date, that may further impact our business activities if they are adopted. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation of CCPA exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is 

44



possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion of drugs from participation in state and federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time and resource consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
Current and Future Healthcare Reform Legislation
In the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive for any approved products.
In the U.S., for example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted. The ACA, among other things: 

● | subjects biological products to potential competition by lower cost biosimilars;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expands healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, establishes new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | creates a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% as of January 1, 2019, pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018) point of sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expands eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expands the entities eligible for discounts under the PHS Act’s pharmaceutical pricing program, also known as the 340B Drug Pricing Program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | creates new requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

45




● | creates a new requirement to annually report the identity and quantity of drug samples that manufacturers and authorized distributors of record provide to physicians;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | creates a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establishes the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the provisions of the ACA have been subject to judicial challenges as well as efforts to repeal, replace or otherwise modify them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. For example: 

● | The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals for spending reductions. The Joint Selection Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction, which triggered the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. In concert with subsequent legislation, this includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year through 2030. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economy Security Act (“CARES Act”), and subsequent legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions will be suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to several types of health care providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years, among other things.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”), includes a provision that eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate,” effective January 1, 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (“BBA”), among other things, amends the Medicare statute, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole” by raising the manufacturer discount under the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program to 70% (as of January 1, 2019).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In addition to these legislative efforts, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021, which was subsequently extended through August 15, 2021, during which consumers can enroll in coverage (or adjust existing enrollment) in states with marketplaces served by the HealthCare.gov platform. State-based marketplaces operating their own platform have the option to take similar actions in their states. The executive order also directed certain federal agencies to review and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

46




reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. Additional legislative challenges, regulatory changes and judicial challenges related to the ACA remain possible.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, there has been increasing legislative, regulatory, and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. 

● | At the federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs the HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In addition, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule to implement a “Most Favored Nation” demonstration project to test Medicare Part B reimbursement of certain separately payable drugs or biologicals identified by CMS as having the highest annual Medicare Part B spending via an alternative payment methodology based on international reference prices. However, on December 29, 2021 CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs. 
In addition, there have been changes related to Medicare Part B reimbursement for drugs purchased under the 340B drug pricing program. In 2018, CMS implemented a reduction in reimbursement for Medicare Part B drugs obtained under the 340B program from Average Sales Price (ASP) +6% to ASP -22.5%. This reduction has been challenged in federal court, and in July 2021 the Supreme Court has agreed to hear this case. CMS has indicated that it will continue to evaluate Medicare Part B reimbursement for 340B-purchased drugs. 
Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including by imposing price or patient assistance constraints, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and other transparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation of pharmaceutical products from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will 

47



be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Packaging and Distribution in the U.S.
If our products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Other U.S. Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of apitegromab, SRK-181 and any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Amendments. The Hatch 

48



Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCI Act”). This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch.
A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the U.S. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
European Union Drug Development
In the EU, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the U.S., medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the U.S., the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
In April 2014, the EU adopted the Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022. The main characteristics of the new Clinical Trials Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, 

49



overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. The Clinical Trial Regulation will have a transition period of three years from the date it became effective.
In the EU the Pediatric Committee (“PDCO”) of the EMA must approve the pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”) prior to filing a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”), unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The PIP outlines the pharmaceutical company’s strategy for investigation of the new medicinal product in the pediatric population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized procedure by the EC, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of any supplementary protection certificate (“SPC”), provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to 2 years before the SPC expires. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
European Union Expedited Review and Development
PRIME, or PRIority MEdicine, is a scheme provided by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation where the MAA will be made through the centralized procedure. To qualify for PRIME, product candidates require early clinical evidence that the therapy has the potential to offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments or benefits patients without treatment options. Products from small-and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”) may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Among the benefits of PRIME are the appointment of a rapporteur to provide continuous support and help build knowledge ahead of an MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process. The receipt of PRIME designation does not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Where, during the course of development, a product no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.
European Union Drug Marketing
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the U.S., the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is typically governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the EU, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). There are two types of MAs.
Centralized MAs, which are issued by the EC through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the EMA, are valid throughout the EU, and in the additional Member States (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) of the EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain 

50



types of products, such as medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (i.e., gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the EU Member States and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU Member State, this national MA can be recognized in another Member State through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference Member State (“RMS”). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (“SmPC”), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU Member States make an assessment of the risk benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
A paediatric-use marketing authorization (“PUMA”) is available for medicines which are already authorized, no longer covered by an SPC or patent that qualifies as an SPC and which are to be exclusively development for use in children. A PUMA is a dedicated MA covering the indication and formulation of a medicinal product developed exclusively for use in the paediatric population, where such development has been in accordance with an approved PIP. There are various incentives to apply for a PUMA, including access to the centralized procedure even where the product would otherwise fall outside the mandatory scope of this procedure. 
European Union Data and Market Exclusivity
In the EU, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents applicants for authorization of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU, during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar MAA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained an MA based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.

European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
In the EU, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”), grants orphan designation to promote the development of products that are (1) intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions; (2) either (a) affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) where it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected by the condition. 
In the EU, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval during which time no “similar medicinal product” may be placed on the market. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinial product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. We will be required to apply for the maintenance of the orphan designation granted to apitegromab for the treatment of SMA at the time of applying for an MA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the EU Member States, plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
European General Data Protection Regulation
Since we conduct clinical trials in the EEA, we are subject to additional European data privacy laws. The General Data Protection Regulation, (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”), became effective on May 25, 2018, and deals with the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. The GDPR imposes a broad range of strict requirements on companies subject to the GDPR, including requirements relating to having legal bases for processing personal data (such as health and other sensitive data,) relating to identifiable individuals and transferring such information outside the EEA, including to the U.S., providing details to those individuals regarding the processing of their personal information, keeping personal information secure, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, having data processing agreements with third parties who process personal information, responding to individuals’ requests to exercise their rights in respect of their personal information, reporting security breaches involving personal data to the competent national data protection authority and affected individuals, appointing data protection officers, conducting data protection impact assessments, and record-keeping. The GDPR increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance, including fines of up to 10,000,000 Euros or up to 2% of our total worldwide annual turnover for certain comparatively minor offenses, or up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of our total worldwide annual turnover for more serious offenses, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. Given the limited enforcement of the GDPR to date, we face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements on our trials and we may be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of the new law. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities.
National laws of member states of the EU are in the process of being adapted to the requirements under the GDPR, thereby implementing national laws which may partially deviate from the GDPR and impose different obligations from country to country, so that we do not expect to operate in a uniform legal landscape in the EEA. Also, as it relates to processing and transfer of genetic data, the GDPR specifically allows national laws to impose additional and more specific requirements or restrictions, and European laws have historically differed quite substantially in this field, leading to additional uncertainty. In addition, further to the UK’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR 

52



ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR, the EC has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing.
In the event we continue to conduct clinical trials in the EEA, we must also ensure that we maintain adequate safeguards to enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA, in particular to the U.S., in compliance with European data protection laws. On June 4, 2021, the EC issued new forms of standard contractual clauses for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU/EEA (or otherwise subject to the GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EU/EEA (and not subject to the GDPR). The new standard contractual clauses replace the standard contractual clauses that were adopted previously under the EU Data Protection Directive. The UK is not subject to the EC’s new standard contractual clauses but has published a draft version of a UK-specific transfer mechanism, which, once finalized, will enable transfers from the UK. Following a ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union, in Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland Limited and Maximillian Schrems (‘Schrems II’), Case C-311/18 (“Schrems II”), companies relying on standard contractual clauses to govern transfers of personal data to third countries (in particular the United States) will need to assess whether the data importer can ensure sufficient guarantees for safeguarding the personal data under GDPR. This assessment includes assessing whether third party vendors can also ensure these guarantees. We will be required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted data transfers under the EU and UK GDPR and doing so will require significant effort and cost. We expect that we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our efforts to comply with our obligations under European privacy laws will be sufficient. If we are investigated by a European data protection authority, we may face fines and other penalties. Any such investigation or charges by European data protection authorities could have a negative effect on our existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new clients or pharmaceutical partners. We may also experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national clients or pharmaceutical partners to continue to use our products and solutions due to the potential risk exposure as a result of the current (and, in particular, future) data protection obligations imposed on them by certain data protection authorities in interpretation of current law, including the GDPR. Such clients or pharmaceutical partners may also view any alternative approaches to compliance as being too costly, too burdensome, too legally uncertain, or otherwise objectionable and therefore decide not to do business with us. Any of the foregoing could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
Regulation in the United Kingdom
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, and the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. There was a transition period during which EU pharmaceutical laws continued to apply to the UK, which expired on December 31, 2020. However, the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore currently largely aligns with EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in the future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. 
​
Clinical Trials 
The UK has implemented the now repealed Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC into national law through the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended). The extent to which the regulation of 

53



clinical trials in the UK will mirror the new Clinical Trials Regulation that has come into effect is not yet known, however the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), the UK medicines regulator, has opened a consultation on a set of proposals designed to improve and strengthen the UK clinical trials legislation. Such consultation is open until 14 March 2022. 
Orphan Designation 
Since January 1, 2021, a separate process for orphan drug designation to the EU process has been applied to Great Britain. There is now no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation (as there is in the EU) in Great Britain and the application for orphan designation will be reviewed by the MHRA at the time of an application for a UK or Great Britain MA. The criteria for orphan designation remain the same as in the EU, except that they apply to Great Britain only (e.g., there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in Great Britain, as opposed to the EU). 
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the UK, the EU and the U.S., such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Additional Laws and Regulations Governing International Operations
If we further expand our operations outside of the U.S., we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.
Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the U.S., or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the U.S., it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the U.S., which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.
The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions.

Coverage and Reimbursement
Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs and treatments they will cover and the amount of reimbursement. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. 
Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a product is (i) a covered benefit under its health plan; (ii) safe, effective and medically necessary; (iii) appropriate for the specific patient; (iv) cost-effective; and (v) neither experimental nor investigational. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition.
In the U.S. no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drugs or biological products exists, and one payor’s determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors will make a similar determination. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products candidates, if approved, will be made on a payor by payor basis. The level of coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products candidates, if approved, will be made on a payor by payor basis. The coverage determination process may be a time consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. 
A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and payors, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. 
Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales.
Additional federal programs apply to pharmaceutical companies that affect coverage and reimbursement for drug products. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (“AMP”) to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, creating a new method by which rebates owed by are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of 

55



Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “MMA”) established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low priced and high priced member states, can further reduce prices. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost effectiveness of any of our product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries.

Human Capital
Our employees are relentlessly focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines in which signaling by protein growth factors plays a fundamental role. Our people are our most important asset, embodying our values such as discovering the joy in science, in collaboration and in making a difference in the lives of patients, families and our communities. We are guided by our core values to create a collaborative, flexible, agile, empowering, and silo-free culture so that we can move with speed and urgency to deliver high-impact medicines to patients with devastating diseases.
Employees. As of March 1, 2022, we had 145 full-time employees, of which 110 employees are engaged in research and development activities and 35 are engaged in general and administrative activities. All of our employees are based in the U.S. and a majority are based in Massachusetts. During 2021, we enhanced our capabilities by adding 23 new full-time employees. The new employees were hired to support a variety of functions and key initiatives, including extending our research, clinical and pre-clinical pipeline development, with hires in clinical development and operations, research, and general and administrative functions. We anticipate continuing to add depth and new capabilities in key areas of our business. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. 
Career Development and Growth. We emphasize employee development and training. To empower employees to unleash their potential individually and as a team, we invest in our employees by providing development opportunities, and the necessary resources to support their success, including coaching, management and leadership training, presentation workshops and paid conference attendance. The diversity of our employees and their skillsets also offers a unique opportunity for us to learn from each other’s experiences.
Compensation and Benefits. Our competitive compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. We provide employee salaries that are competitive within our industry based on position, skill level, experience and knowledge. Additionally, we offer equity to each of our employees to align the interests of our employees with the company’s mission.
We are committed to providing comprehensive benefit options and it is our intention to offer benefits that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Some examples of the benefits we offer are: medical insurance including prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, accident insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, wellness programs, access to mental health support and benefits, identity theft insurance and pet insurance.
Employee Engagement. We routinely conduct confidential employee engagement surveys to obtain feedback on a variety of topics, including culture, values, diversity and inclusion, career development, employee satisfaction and tenure, and execution of our company strategy. These survey results are reviewed by our executive team so that we can continue to continue to increase employee satisfaction and improve the well-being of our employees. We value and encourage fostering mechanisms and opportunities for two-way dialogue. We actively strive to operationalize feedback provided by employees in ways that align with our business and culture. We are also committed to communication and transparency, using multiple forums and channels to allow for the sharing of appropriate, timely information to all employees.
​
Health & Safety. Ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees and communities is of the utmost importance to us, particularly in light of COVID-19. What we have seen as a result of the pandemic is that flexibility is top of mind and a key consideration. At the start of the pandemic, we immediately formed a task force to keep up to date on federal, state and local mandates as well as the evolving science and communicate with our employees on a regular basis. We’ve offered daily onsite testing, masks at no cost to our employees and visitors and when necessary, conduct internal contract tracing. 
​

57



The need to shift to working from home, has refocused our work model. We’ve helped employees set up home offices, provided them access to tools to perform their jobs remotely, provided ergonomic assessments of their working environments, and helped them address IT connectivity. We’ve also found ways to continue to foster collaboration and community through events like virtual trivia nights, scavenger hunts, coffee chats, charitable giving and lunch-n-learns, that we would normally do in person.
Diversity & Inclusion (“D&I”): We believe that fostering diversity and inclusion is a business imperative which supports and encourages individuals to show up as their whole selves. Investing in meaningful D&I work enhances culture and employee experience. We are committed to creating and maintaining a diverse, inclusive and safe work environment. As we grow and mature, we look forward to establishing programs that infuse D&I within the business, identify barriers that impact recruitment, development and retention of underrepresented employees, identify educational content, communicate the value and impact of D&I on goals and objectives, all while continuing to focus on hiring diverse talent at all levels of the company. Our ability to innovate and meet people’s needs is strongest when all voices are heard and valued.
​
COVID-19 Pandemic 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, as a pandemic (the “COVID-19 pandemic”), which continues to spread throughout the U.S. and worldwide. We could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent the further spread, including the development and deployment of any vaccine program. Accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, including our clinical trials, financial condition and results of operations will be affected. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced disruptions that have impacted our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials, including disruptions or restrictions on our ability to access and monitor certain clinical trial sites, restrictions on clinical trial participants’ ability to access our clinical trial sites and delays in enrollment. Some clinical trial participants have missed or experienced delays in receiving doses of study drug and completing their clinical trial assessments. For example, four patients (one in Cohort 2 and three in Cohort 3) of the TOPAZ clinical trial each missed three doses of apitegromab over the course of the 12-month treatment period due to COVID-19-related site access restrictions. This has affected our clinical trials and could result in further impacts, including delays in or adverse impacts to data readouts from our clinical trials, delays in our ability to identify and enroll patients in current or future clinical trials and decisions by enrolled patients to discontinue from our clinical trials due to COVID-19 related concerns. While our laboratory operations have resumed to near-normal capacity, we may continue to experience challenges in procuring materials and supplies, as well as research services from our vendors in a consistently timely manner due to COVID-19 related supply chain issues. Some of our third-party manufacturers have diverted resources or manufacturing capacity to accommodate the development or manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines. Although this has not had an impact on our ability to produce sufficient quantities of apitegromab or SRK-181 for our clinical trials, we continue to work closely with our third-party manufacturers to mitigate potential impacts to our clinical supply chain. In addition, delays in the development of COVID-19 vaccines or the deployment of vaccines which are approved or otherwise authorized for emergency use, a recurrence or “subsequent waves” of COVID-19 cases, or the discovery of vaccine-resistant COVID-19 variants could cause other widespread or more severe impacts. We continue to monitor developments as we adjust to the disruptions and evaluate the uncertainties relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters and operations are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
In March 2015, we entered into a lease of laboratory and office space at 620 Memorial Drive in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Our amended lease expires in September 2023 and we have an option to extend the lease term for five additional years. In October 2020, we entered into a Sublease agreement with Orna Therapeutics, Inc. to lease this space for the period February 1, 2021 through August 31, 2023, unless terminated earlier. 

58



In November 2019, we entered into a lease of laboratory and office space at 301 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts to be used as our new corporate headquarters. The expiration date is in August 2025 and we have the option to extend the term by two years. We relocated our headquarters to 301 Binney Street in 2021.
We believe that our facilities at 301 Binney Street are adequate to meet our current needs, and that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed.
