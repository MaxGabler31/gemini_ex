Item 1.   Business
The Company
We are building the next generation experience for e-commerce. We believe that by investing for the long term in technology and infrastructure with a fanatical culture of customer centricity, we are delivering a superior customer experience at a lower cost and are continuing to redefine standards for e-commerce worldwide. 
Historically, online shopping has forced customers to accept various compromises. E-commerce is convenient, but shipping times can be long and inconsistent. Services promising faster shipping often force customers to choose from a fraction of the selection, order before early cut-off times, pay higher fees or prices, or all of the above. After delivery, customers accept the hassle of cardboard disposal and cumbersome returns as the price of e-commerce convenience. We set out to address these tradeoffs and transform the customer experience.
Our efforts have centered on building an end-to-end integrated system of technology and infrastructure. Our complete integration enables us to control and improve the entire experience, from the mobile customer to the delivery of the order at the customer’s door, while increasing efficiency and lowering prices for customers. It requires significant investment in technology and infrastructure, exceptional execution, and most importantly, an innovation-focused culture driven to raise our customers’ expectations and lead them to wonder “How did I ever live without Coupang?” 
On March 2, 2022, we announced that management revised its reportable segments to reflect the way the Company now manages its business and to promote improved visibility to our business performance. The change will lead to the following two reportable segments: 
•Product Commerce, including the Company’s core retail and marketplace offering and Rocket Fresh, as well as advertising products associated with these offerings; and 
•Growth Initiatives, including the Company’s nascent offerings and services, including Coupang Eats, Coupang Play, international and fintech initiatives. 
The change to our segment reporting is a subsequent event and therefore does not affect the historical results, discussion or presentation of our consolidated results as set forth in this Report. We will report our financial results consistent with this new segment reporting structure beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022.
Our Customer Experience
We are committed to delivering a “wow” experience to all of our customers every day no matter where they are located. This commitment drives every aspect of our operations and pushes us to redefine the standards of e-commerce. We reimagined the e-commerce experience with our Rocket Delivery service:
•Dawn and Same-Day Delivery. Orders are delivered within hours via Dawn Delivery (ordered as late as midnight, arrive before 7am) or Same-Day Delivery (ordered in the morning, arrive same-day). 
•Next-Day or Faster Delivery for Nearly 100% of Orders. Customers are eligible for free, one-day delivery nationwide 365 days a year. 
•Last Order by Midnight. Customers are promised free, next-day delivery for orders placed any time of day—even seconds before midnight. 
•Vast Selection of Items, Including Fresh Groceries. Customers can order from a selection of items across almost every category of goods—from fresh produce to consumer electronics—for next-day delivery. 
•Low Prices Every Day. Our end-to-end integration of technology and infrastructure, retail leadership, and significant scale economies generate cost efficiencies that allow us to pass along savings to our customers in the form of free shipping and low prices. 
•Boxless / Zero Packaging. Our fulfillment process reduces the use of cardboard boxes in parcels we package, and our Zero Packaging, first introduced for Rocket Fresh, eliminates almost all disposable packaging by delivering in eco-bags that are collected for reuse after each delivery.
•Frictionless Returns. Our customers simply tap a button on the app and leave the item outside their door for pickup. Refunds are initiated the moment the item is picked up at the door.
To realize our differentiated customer experience, we built a completely integrated e-commerce and logistics system that controls every facet of the customer experience from the purchase on our app to the delivery and photo confirmation of the order at the door. Much of our innovation in speed, efficiency, waste reduction, and customer convenience has been made possible by the unique end-to-end technology and infrastructure integration that we have pioneered. 
Coupang launched as an online marketplace in 2010 to enable merchants to leverage technology and innovation to grow and compete. In order to improve the customer experience with end-to-end control, we launched our owned-inventory selection in 2013 and Rocket Delivery in 2014. We have also extended our network and systems to new offerings that will further improve our customers’ lives. In 2019, we launched our Rocket WOW membership program for a flat monthly fee. It began by offering unlimited free shipping with no minimum spend. Today, members also enjoy Dawn Delivery and Same-Day Delivery shipping options, free unlimited returns for 30 days, Rocket Fresh groceries, and content streaming on Coupang Play. In 2019, we also launched Coupang Eats, which allows consumers to place restaurant orders that are available for pickup or delivery using delivery partners directly contracted by us. Coupang Eats leverages, in part, the technology and infrastructure that we built for Rocket Delivery. We believe the success of these offerings demonstrate the power of our network to extend new offerings to our loyal customers.
Our Merchant Experience
We believe that our merchants and the selection that they bring significantly enhance our customer offerings. We offer merchants of all sizes effective solutions to improve their customer experience and enhance demand generation. Our customer-to-product matching technology ingests millions of new merchant listings daily into our product knowledge graph, and, leveraging machine learning, provides personalized product exposure to customers based on relevance and predicted customer experience. This technology helps merchants compete holistically on overall customer experience. We will continue to partner with merchants and provide solutions that enable them to grow, scale, and succeed.
Our Opportunity
Korea’s Attractive Commerce Market 
Total spend in retail, grocery, consumer food service, and travel in Korea was $483 billion in 2021 and is expected to increase to $616 billion in 2025. Within that, Korea is home to one of the largest and fastest growing e-commerce opportunities anywhere in the world. Total e-commerce spend was $196 billion in 2021, and is forecasted to increase at an 10% CAGR to $291 billion by 2025, which would make it the third largest e-commerce segment globally behind the U.S. and China.
Advertising
In addition to our e-commerce services, we also have offerings in the online advertising space. We offer opportunities to advertise on our websites and mobile applications.
Our Growth Strategies
The key elements of our growth strategy include: 
•Attract More Customers. We had approximately 17.9 million Active Customers in the quarter ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 21% from the quarter ended December 31, 2020. We believe we have the ability to attract more customers with our continued drive to focus on our customer experience, our expansion of newer offerings provided for the customer, and our desire to reshape e-commerce globally.
•Increase Customer Engagement. We believe that our superior customer proposition allows us to increase the wallet share of existing customers through more frequent buying across more product categories and offerings. We intend to

achieve growth through further innovation and improvements to our customers’ shopping experience, including expanding product selection, adding new offerings, enhancing our Rocket WOW membership program benefits, ensuring high-quality customer service, and through marketing and promotional campaigns. We also continue to refine our business intelligence systems to provide more personalized search results and recommendations to help existing customers find and buy more of what they need on Coupang. 
•Continue Investment in Technology and Infrastructure. Technology is core to our ability to scale, improve efficiencies, and innovate. We prioritize building our own technology and investing in engineering talent. We also plan to enhance our infrastructure by building new fulfillment and logistics centers to expand coverage, reduce delivery times, and optimize our cost structure. 
•Explore New Initiatives to Broaden Our Offerings. We are always exploring new business initiatives to broaden our offerings. These new initiatives include augmenting solutions for merchants and expanding digital finance programs for consumers and merchants, and expanding our offerings to new markets outside Korea. We continue to invest significant resources on testing new products or services that may appeal to our customers.
Sales and Marketing
We market our offerings to customers directly through brand advertising and direct marketing. We use broad-based promotional campaigns, such as media ads, to promote opportunities our services provide. Our direct marketing primarily consists of customer discounts, promotions, and referrals. We attract customers through sponsored search, social networking sites, email marketing campaigns, and other similar initiatives. 
Human Capital
Our global team of employees is the driving force in creating a one-of-a-kind experience for millions of customers. In the same way our employees aim to go above and beyond for our customers, we aim to go above and beyond for them. As one of the largest private sector employers in South Korea, we directly employ over 68,000 employees as of December 31, 2021. We believe our direct employment model, along with competitive wages, training and safety programs, and a broad range of comprehensive benefits, empowers our diverse set of employees to deliver the “wow” experiences for our customers we strive to create every day. 
Most of our employees are frontline workers, and we make their health, safety, and wellness a top priority. In 2020 and 2021, we made significant investments in health and safety initiatives that helped strengthen our leading safety record, which is one of the best in the Korean logistics industry and globally3. These initiatives include Coupang Care, the first paid health promotion program of its kind at scale for logistics workers in Korea. We also lead the Korean logistics industry in workplace standards and policies, such as the provision of health insurance even to temporary workers from day one, and driver workweeks estimated to be nearly 30% fewer hours than the industry average (and lower than several major US logistics companies). We believe the well-being of our employees is directly tied to the success of our business, and most importantly, our impact on our customers. 
Our Competition
We compete with: (1) offline, online, and omnichannel retailers, suppliers, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (3) companies that provide e-commerce merchant services; (4) companies that sell grocery products online and offline; (5) on-demand food delivery services; (6) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties; (7) companies that provide online advertising products and services; and (8) financial services companies, including credit cards and payment platforms. 
We believe that we are well positioned to effectively compete on the basis of the factors listed above.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal, reflecting typical consumer purchasing behavior patterns over the course of the calendar year. Typically, we see peak order volumes in the first and fourth quarters, which include major holidays such as Korean Chuseok in late September and October, the Christmas and New Year holiday in December, and Lunar New Year in January and February. In addition to seasonality in demand, suppliers are also impacted by seasonal weather patterns that could affect certain products,

such as fresh produce. As our business grows and we enter new categories or launch new products, other seasonal trends may develop, or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other legal and contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights.

We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including technical and administrative security controls and contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements (or similar agreements) with our employees, consultants, and contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our terms of service.
