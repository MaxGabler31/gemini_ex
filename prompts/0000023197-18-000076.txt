Competitive Strengths
The successful execution of our principal corporate strategies is based on our competitive strengths, including the following:

(1) | We Have Significant Exposure to Large, Growing End Markets

We believe Comtech is well positioned to capitalize on some of the most significant emerging technology trends occurring worldwide and that customers around the world will increasingly turn to us to fulfill their needs for secure wireless communications in some of the most demanding environments, including those where traditional communications are unavailable or cost-prohibitive, and in mission-critical scenarios where performance is crucial. These important emerging technology trends include growth in global wireless penetration and mobile data consumption, proliferation of mobile applications requiring trusted location data, the need for public safety agencies to seamlessly connect individuals with first responders, widespread deployment of in-flight connectivity solutions by airlines worldwide, and the rapidly expanding breadth of High Definition ("HD") and 4K broadcasting content, all of which we believe will result in an increase in global voice, video and data usage that will, in turn, result in increased demand for the secure wireless and satellite communication solutions that we provide.

(2) | We Believe We Are a Market Leader in the End-Markets That We Serve

Commercial Solutions Segment
Communication Technologies - We believe we are the leading provider of Single Channel per Carrier ("SCPC") satellite earth station modems. Many of our key satellite earth station products incorporate Turbo Product Code ("TPC") forward error correction technology and our licensed DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology which enables our customers to optimize their satellite networks by either reducing their satellite transponder lease costs or increasing data throughput. We believe we are a leader in the traveling wave tube amplifiers ("TWTA") market and we differentiate our product offerings by our ability to develop the most efficient size, weight and power profile. Our TWTA products are vital to satellite communication applications such as traditional broadcast, direct-to-home ("DTH") broadcast and satellite newsgathering. We provide solid-state amplifiers that are also used to amplify signals carrying voice, video or data for air-to-satellite-to-ground communications. For example, our amplifiers, when incorporated into an aircraft satellite communication system, can provide passengers with email, Internet access and video conferencing. Certain of our high-powered amplifiers are AS-900 (an airborne quality standard) certified. We believe we are a leader in providing amplifiers for the growing in-flight connectivity market.
Safety and Security Technologies - We believe that we are a leader in public safety communication technologies used for delivery of 911 calls. We believe we have significant market share in the routing of U.S. wireless 911 calls, Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") 911 calls and Text to 911 deployments. We believe we are one of two companies fulfilling the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") requirements for Enhanced 911 ("E911") call-routing to public safety answering points ("PSAPs") for wireless and VoIP network operators. E911 refers to 911 calls for both wireline and wireless telephones that are enhanced to provide location information of the caller. We are focusing our marketing and research and development efforts to meet system standards for next generation 911 ("NG911"), which refers to an Internet Protocol ("IP") based system that allows digital information (e.g., voice, photos, videos, text messages) to flow seamlessly from the public, through the 911 network and on to emergency responders.

Enterprise Technologies - Our Short-Messaging Service ("SMS") Center software has been used by wireless carrier subscribers to send and receive text or data messages to and from wireless devices for almost two decades. We provide ongoing operational support for our installed base of systems, including administration of system components, system optimization and configuration management. Our systems include our Location Trust Score technology, a unique process we developed to reliably identify a mobile location by generating a "Location Trust Score." Additionally, we offer Location Studio TM, a complete end-to-end location-based services platform for mobile carriers, application developers and enterprises. The platform consists of multiple modular technology suites that provide a rich set of functionalities, including indoor and outdoor positioning, geolocation, mapping, search, routing, navigation, real-time message updates and analytics. This platform includes Look4TM geo-services which enable customers to build their own applications powered by our location-based technology and a cloud-based positioning engine. We believe the positioning of Location StudioTM is unique in the industry and is an appealing alternative to free consumer-based mapping services which are subject to change by the supplier and which may not meet an enterprise’s privacy and security requirements.
Government Solutions Segment
Command and Control Technologies - We are a key supplier to the U.S. Army for mission critical command and control technology solutions and field support services. We are a prime contractor under several indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity ("IDIQ") defense contract vehicles or task orders, including the: (i) Army’s Global Tactical Advanced Communications Systems ("GTACS") contract, (ii) Defense Information Systems Agency’s Custom SATCOM Solutions ("CS2") contract and (iii) Complex Commercial SATCOM Solutions ("CS3") contract from the General Services Administration. We also provide the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") personnel with curriculum development and training services to support cybersecurity workforce development. We currently provide sustainment services to the U.S. Army’s AN/TSC-198 family of communication systems that are commonly referred to as "SNAP" (Secret Internet Protocol Router ("SIPR") and Non-secure Internet Protocol Router ("NIPR") Access Point) Very Small Aperture Terminals ("VSATs"). Additionally, we continue to work with the U.S. Army to deploy our next generation MT-2025 mobile satellite transceivers, which are also known as the Blue Force Tracker-2 High Capacity ("BFT-2-HC") satellite transceivers. The MT-2025 transceivers meet BFT-2 protocols, provide best-in-class reliability and are fully backward compatible with the Blue Force Tracking-1 ("BFT-1") system. Comtech previously shipped over 100,000 BFT-1 mobile satellite transceivers and currently provides sustaining support for the older BFT-1 system.
Troposcatter Technologies - We have designed, manufactured and sold over-the-horizon microwave products and systems for approximately forty years and believe we are the leading supplier in this specialized product market. We believe we offer the only available adaptive troposcatter modem operating at 50 Mbps. Our Modular Tactical Transmission System ("MTTS") provides a high capacity, beyond-line-of-sight modular communications system designed for easy and rapid deployment. Our MTTS also offers seamless compatibility and interoperability with legacy-fielded troposcatter systems currently used by the U.S. military, including all versions of the AN/TRC-170.
RF Power & Switching Technologies - We are one of the largest independent suppliers of broadband, high-power, high-performance RF microwave amplifiers, which reproduce signals with high power and are extremely complex and critical to the performance of the systems into which they are incorporated. Many of these amplifiers are produced in-house by large companies; however, our expertise has created a cost-effective and technologically superior alternative to in-house sourcing. Some of the companies who have outsourced amplifier production to us include Rockwell Collins, Inc., Thales Group, European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company ("EADS"), Telephonics Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, BAE Systems PLC and Raytheon Company. Our amplifiers are also used in oncology treatment systems that allow physicians to give cancer patients higher doses of radiation that are more closely focused on cancerous tissue, thereby minimizing damage to healthy tissue.

(3) | We Believe We Provide Industry Leading Innovation, Capabilities and Solutions

We have established a leading position of technology innovation in our fields through internal and customer-funded research and development activities, which have yielded significant advances. Examples of our industry-leading innovation include:
Our HEIGHTSTM Networking Platform - Our HEIGHTSTM networking platform ("HEIGHTS") is the cornerstone of our current research and development efforts and is increasingly becoming a focus of satellite earth station equipment sales and marketing efforts. HEIGHTS is an advanced networking platform that combines our most efficient waveforms, compression engines and the ability to provide dynamic bandwidth and power management to meet the demands of customers operating on traditional fixed satellite service systems ("FSS") while providing advantages for customers who plan to transition to high throughput satellite ("HTS") systems in the future. Our HEIGHTS networking platform, a successor to our advanced VSAT series of products, is ideally suited for cellular backhaul, universal service obligation networks and other applications that require high performance in a hub-spoke environment. Our HEIGHTS Dynamic Network Access Technology solutions are designed to deliver the highest Internet Protocol bits per Hertz in its class.

Our SLM-5650B Satellite Modems - During fiscal 2018, the U.S. Space and Naval Warfare System Command, in support of the Program Executive Office for Command, Control, Communications, Computer and Intelligence, awarded us a strategically important multi-year $59.0 million contract to procure our SLM-5650B satellite modems, upgrade kits and related services. This IDIQ sole-source contract has five one-year ordering periods. There are over eight-hundred older generation modems currently utilized by multiple Navy programs. We believe that no other competitor responded to the NAVY’s initial Request for Proposal ("RFP") and we believe our modems and related upgrade kits will meet critical Navy requirements.
Our Gallium Nitride Based Amplifiers - These amplifiers, which incorporate Gallium Nitride ("GaN") technology, offer customers smaller size, more power and higher efficiency. With continued technology evolution in the GaN semiconductor marketplace, we have successfully developed GaN based products with our GaN semiconductor partners that are achieving higher power levels than previously available in solid state amplifiers. We believe this will create opportunities to replace difficult to utilize amplifiers which use antiquated technology and are more expensive to operate. In recent years, we have developed a new series of high-power GaN Solid State Power Amplifiers ("SSPA") which we believe are more compact and significantly more efficient than other SSPAs on the market, making them ideal for transportable and mobile applications where power draw matters. These new SSPAs include: our new XTLIN200K SSPA which covers 13.75 to 14.5 GHz Ku-band with a minimum of 200W of linear power; our new XTLIN-100K SSPA which also covers 13.75 to 14.5 GHz Ku-band but with a minimum of 100W of linear power and which allows easy conversion from X-band to Ku-band; and our new XTLIN-200X SSPA which can be used for tactical X-band and which offers a minimum of 200W of linear power. Our ground-based amplifiers are built with modular components for rapid deployment and easy scaling up in power. Products at different frequency bands share common physical designs, which saves manufacturing cost and allows easy conversion for tactical military customers to transmit up to 200W of linear power in either X-band or Ku-band depending on regional satellite availability. GaN technology is also incorporated into our airborne products and we have introduced products in both Ku-band and Ka-band to address the growing demand for satellite-based inflight connectivity on commercial aircrafts. We believe these products will meet the needs of our customers for many years ahead. 
Our Trusted Location Technology Solutions - In order to determine a cellular phone user’s location, many companies utilize technology that combines wireless network-derived location data with data from the phone’s on-board global positioning system receiver. In 2016, we were issued a U.S. patent for our Location Trust Score technology. This patent grants us important intellectual property protection and licensing opportunities for a unique process that identifies the reliability of a stated mobile location by generating a "Location Trust Score." We believe this technology is a major breakthrough in providing secure, accurate and reliable information and a powerful tool for identifying fraud, preventing "false positive" denials of service and confirming location compliance for regulated industries.

(4) | We Have a Diverse Global Customer Base

We have established long-standing relationships with hundreds of customers worldwide. Our customers include leading system and network suppliers in the global satellite, defense, broadcast and aerospace industries, as well as the U.S. federal government, U.S. state and local governments, and foreign governments.
Our satellite earth station products and our high-power amplifiers are used by hundreds of international customers including mobile cellular network providers and governments around the world. We also have ongoing relationships with the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, U.S. Army and other government agencies. Our global commercial and government customers are increasingly seeking integrated solutions to meet their operational needs. We believe that our customers recognize our ability to develop improved technologies and to meet stringent program requirements.
We have long-standing relationships with U.S.-based telecommunications companies, including Verizon Wireless and AT&T, through various divisions, directly and through channels.
We believe the TCS acquisition has further strengthened our relationship with the U.S. government given its prime position on key contracts. Prior to the acquisition, Comtech and TCS had worked together for a number of years to offer the U.S. military a troposcatter system in a transportable flyaway configuration (known as the AN/TCS-198(V3) or SNAP-3T) which is capable of providing seamless compatibility and interoperability with legacy-fielded over-the-horizon microwave systems. Over time, we hope to utilize these prime contracts to facilitate procurement by the U.S. government for our satellite earth station and over-the-horizon microwave equipment and systems, given the ever-increasing amount of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (also known as "C4ISR") information that is being generated.

Our Two Business Segments
We manage our business through two reportable operating segments: Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions. Our corporate senior management team supports the business segments by, among other things, actively seeking to exploit potential synergies that exist between the segments, including in areas such as manufacturing, technology, sales, marketing and customer support. 
In fiscal 2018, our Commercial Solutions segment contributed 60.5% of our consolidated net sales and our Government Solutions segment contributed 39.5% of our consolidated net sales. Additional financial information about our business segments, including net sales, operating income, Adjusted EBITDA (a Non-GAAP financial measure), total assets, and our operations outside the United States, is provided in "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (13) Segment Information" included in "Part II - Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Commercial Solutions Segment
Overview
Our Commercial Solutions segment serves commercial customers and smaller government customers, such as state and local governments, that require advanced communication technologies to meet their needs. This segment also serves certain large government customers (including the U.S. government) that have requirements for off-the-shelf commercial equipment. We believe this segment is a leading provider of satellite communications (such as satellite earth station modems and TWTAs), public safety systems (such as NG911 technologies) and enterprise application technologies (such as messaging and trusted location-based technologies).
Key Markets and Technology Solutions 
Communication Technologies 
We offer communication technologies with particular expertise in the satellite communications industry, which is undergoing a period of significant growth and rapid technological change. Our Commercial Solutions segment manufactures most of the satellite-based communication equipment we sell to our customers including equipment sold by our Government Solutions segment.
We believe that the overall satellite ground station equipment industry will grow over the next few years. This growth is expected to occur as a result of wide-sweeping deployment and upgrades of ground-based systems, including satellite earth stations, as well as integration of high-performance amplifiers used for high-performance systems necessary to meet emerging demand for high-performance applications of satellite communications technologies, such as satellite-based wireless backhaul, direct-to-home ("DTH"), high definition ("HD") and 4K broadcasting and in-flight connectivity.
We believe that Comtech is well positioned to capitalize on this industry growth and change through sales of our market leading, high-performance communication technologies and products, including our SCPC satellite modems, solid-state amplifiers and our HEIGHTS networking platform. Examples of end-market applications that are driving demand for our satellite-based communication technologies include:

• | Satellite-Based Cellular Backhaul. Demand for satellite-based cellular backhaul services is anticipated to grow rapidly as a result of the increased penetration of smart cellular phones and network upgrades to 3G and 4G in developing regions of the world. Ultimately, 5G services will be deployed and mobile data services will become more critical. As mobile data penetration expands and mobile data consumption increases, wireless carriers must invest in their mobile network infrastructure and businesses will require back-up communications. In developing regions of the world and in remote areas where terrestrial network infrastructure is lacking, wireless network operators often backhaul, or transport, their wireless data traffic using satellite-based networking technologies. Comtech is well positioned to serve the high-performance, high availability needs of satellite-based cellular backhaul through sales of our leading SCPC modems, our HEIGHTS networking platform and solid-state amplifiers.


• | New High Throughput Satellites. There are more than 100 new High Throughput Satellite ("HTS") payloads expected to launch over the next decade which we believe is expected to lead to increasingly complex satellite networks. As service providers work to offer connectivity to these high-speed, high-bandwidth satellites and expand their networks to handle the demand for new HTS applications, we believe our HEIGHTS networking platform will be incorporated into many new installations and necessary upgrades of equipment. 

5


• | High Definition and Ultra-High Definition Broadcasting. Reports indicate that in recent years, consumers have purchased millions of High Definition televisions and Ultra-High Definition or "4K" televisions. We believe this will require a significant amount of satellite bandwidth, which will require satellite service providers to upgrade equipment and find new ways to manage the cost and transmission efficiency of their networks. We believe that these requirements will drive increased demand for new SCPC-based modems, our Ka-frequency based 500 Watt TWTA, our HEIGHTS products and our SuperPowerTM TWTAs, which can double TWTA output power and provide direct replacement for bandwidth deficient KPAs. 


• | In-Flight Connectivity. Consumer demand for anytime, anywhere connectivity is rapidly rising. As a result, airlines worldwide are deploying in-flight connectivity and entertainment systems. The deployment of in-flight connectivity and entertainment systems by airlines around the world is creating opportunities for us to serve as a key supplier of amplifier components used for in-flight Ku-band connectivity systems. As airlines move to offer higher speed satellite-based connectivity, we believe this market will experience solid demand over the next few years. 

Safety and Security Technologies 
We offer safety and security technology solutions that enable 911 call routing via cellular, over the Internet using VoIP, and across next generation technology. When someone places an emergency call using one of these technologies, our software, which is utilized by certain telecommunication carriers, can identify the call as an emergency call, accesses the user’s location information from the wireless network and routes the call to the assigned public safety jurisdiction.
We intend to continue to invest in and upgrade our 911 capabilities as we believe this market will grow from current levels. We believe our existing customer base has a need for NG911 systems, including 911 text messaging services, advanced data, real-time photos and other types of information sharing over IP networks. We believe the Commerce Department’s FirstNet system, a nationwide LTE broadband network for over five million first responders, which encompasses police departments, fire departments, the National Guard, and other emergency service providers will facilitate demand for new NG911 systems. Additionally, over time, we believe we can provide systems integration, satellite and location infrastructure terminals, and linkage to NG911 Emergency Services IP Networks ("ESInet"). Although the sales cycle is lengthy and difficult to predict, we believe the market for NG911 products will grow from current levels. As the U.S. adopts NG911 solutions, we believe that other countries will do so as well. Our NG911 solutions have been deployed since 2006 and are utilized by literally millions of people in more than 30 states. Key E911 capability upgrades include: Text-to-911, indoor location accuracy and multimedia messaging.
Enterprise & Trusted Location™ Technologies
We offer enterprise application technologies including location-based technology such as Trusted LocationTM, Look4TM, Indoor Location and text messaging platforms. These technologies are included in some of our Safety and Security Technologies solutions as well.
Leveraging our leading location-based technology expertise, we have developed a wide range of commercial solutions to help address mapping, routing and geolocation to help reduce cybercrime and fraud, as well as enhance public safety. Our Trusted LocationTM product is a software-based scoring system that allows providers to accurately determine mobile location and identify fraudulent behavior (e.g., location spoofing) and other security risks, including risks arising from mobile-based financial transactions. Our Location StudioTM platform allows customers to build their own applications with end-customer functionality such as maps, search, geocoding, routing and navigation using their brand. We believe that enterprise customers are increasingly looking for an alternative to free mapping services that are subject to change by the provider and may not meet the enterprise’s privacy and security requirements. Our Indoor Location solution enables the determination of a cell phone user’s geospatial position in environments where traditional Global Positioning System ("GPS"), global navigation satellite systems and cellular technologies do not work well (such as office buildings). The FCC has mandated that emergency services must incorporate this technology (and we believe other markets will follow) which utilizes more precise location information in mobile applications as well as in driverless cars and C4ISR systems. We provide services to support these applications, and our platform is used to provide "Connected Car" connectivity. Our SpecifixTM application is an advanced data rights platform that allows operators to manage and monetize their location data, while securing user privacy and complying with consumer privacy laws. Our text messaging platforms are used by wireless carriers to provide SMS to their end-customers and are also used to communicate with 911 PSAPs through major network operators. For our installed base of systems, we provide ongoing operational support, including administration of system components, system optimization and configuration management. Maintenance services include tracking customer support issues, troubleshooting and developing and installing maintenance releases.

Government Solutions Segment
Overview
Our Government Solutions segment serves large government end-users (including those of foreign countries) that require mission-critical technologies and systems. We believe this segment is a leading provider of command and control applications (such as the design, installation and operation of data networks that integrate computing and communications, including both satellite and terrestrial links), ongoing network operation and management support services (including project management and fielding and maintenance solutions related to satellite ground terminals), troposcatter communications (such as digital troposcatter multiplexers, digital over-the-horizon modems, troposcatter systems and frequency converter systems) and RF power and switching technologies (such as solid-state high-power broadband amplifiers, enhanced position location reporting system (commonly known as "EPLRS") amplifier assemblies, identification friend or foe ("IFF") amplifiers and amplifiers used in the counteraction of improvised explosive devices).
Key Markets and Technology Solutions 
Our Government Solutions segment offers integrated satellite equipment and designs, installs and operates data networks that integrate computing and communications (including both satellite and terrestrial links). In addition, our Government Solutions segment provides ongoing network operation and management support services including project management, field support and maintenance solutions related to satellite ground terminals and related systems. 
Command & Control (C4ISR) Technologies
With persistent threats from state and non-state actors, governments seek to mitigate these threats using information to increase decision-makers’ situational awareness. This information is collected through various surveillance platforms, such as radars and unmanned aerial vehicles ("UAVs") and transferred and processed through secure communications networks.
We offer a variety of command and control solutions to help close the security gap in an era of information-based, network-centric warfare. These solutions include the supply and support of satellite networks (including the supply of hardware such as satellite transceivers, ruggedized routers and solid-state drives), sustainment services for the AN/TSC-198A SNAP (Secret Internet Protocol Router ("SIPR") and Non-classified Internet Protocol Router ("NIPR") Access Point), Very Small Aperture Terminals ("VSATs") and managed satellite services and integrated global support. We also provide a variety of in-class and on-line training services to our customers to help them protect command and control networks (and other sophisticated networks) from cyber-attacks. Command and control networks depend on global suppliers who can provide value-added support services and we are recognized as an industry leader and global supplier of high reliability products and supply chain services for the U.S. military and aerospace market. These services include the procurement of space components, antenna systems, high reliability Electrical, Electronic and Electromechanical ("EEE") parts in support of critical NASA programs and the design, development and installation of multiple launch vehicle tracking stations in the South Pacific for an international space agency.
Our mobile satellite transceivers have been installed on a variety of U.S. military vehicles (both logistics-centric and war-fighter-centric) including: Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, helicopters such as the Apache, Black Hawk and Chinook and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles. When equipped with this technology, soldiers operating these vehicles are able to be continually tracked and, at the same time, are able to maintain communications with a command center and fellow soldiers in the field. Our mobile satellite transceivers can also be used to facilitate communications in the event that natural disasters or other situations, such as a terrorist attack, disable or limit existing terrestrial communications. Since fiscal 2010, we have provided sustainment support services for the older BFT-1 system while a third party vendor selected by the U.S. Army developed and deployed the next generation BFT program known as BFT-2. We believe that the BFT-2 system can benefit from more reliable satellite transceivers and in fiscal 2018, we received a contract to support the U.S. Army Project Manager Mission Command ("PM MC") and the BFT-2 program to port additional waveforms onto the current BFT-2 transceivers. Separately, we received an initial $11.7 million contract to deploy several thousands of our MT-2025 mobile satellite transceivers, which are also known as the Blue Force Tracker-2 High Capacity ("BFT-2-HC") satellite transceivers. The MT-2025 transceivers meet BFT-2 protocols, provide best-in-class reliability and are fully backward compatible with the BFT-1 system. We previously shipped over 100,000 BFT-1 mobile satellite transceivers. These satellite transceivers are manufactured in our high-volume manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona which is operated by our Commercial Solutions segment. We began initial shipments of MT-2025 transceivers in fiscal 2018 and expect to continue shipments in fiscal 2019. Although the timing of awards is difficult to predict and subject to availability of U.S. government funding, we remain optimistic that we will receive additional orders for our MT-2025 transceivers. Ultimately, in light of technological advances and additional requirements, we believe the U.S. Army will procure a next generation BFT-3 system and we believe we can play a large role in meeting the U.S. Army’s operational needs.

Troposcatter Technologies 
Over-the-horizon microwave systems, sometimes referred to as troposcatter systems, are extremely reliable and secure. Over-the-horizon microwave communication is a cost-effective, secure alternative to satellite communication as it does not require the leasing of expensive satellite transponder space with its attendant recurring costs. U.S. and foreign governments use our over-the-horizon microwave systems to, among other things, transmit radar tracking, run C4ISR applications and to connect remote border locations. Additionally, energy companies use our systems to enable communication links for offshore oil rigs and other remote locations, as well as for exploration activities. Our over-the-horizon microwave systems, which include our patented forward error correction technology, can transmit video and other broadband applications at throughputs of up to 50 megabits per second ("Mbps").
We believe our over-the-horizon microwave technologies often provide affordable and effective solutions to meet the requirements for communications services and that long-term demand will increase. We recently submitted a proposal to supply a significant quantity of our over-the-horizon microwave systems to the U.S. Army. We teamed with a large prime contractor who is providing other required hardware and services and are hopeful that we can win this multi-million dollar award in fiscal 2019.
Our MTTS, the first truly modular, rapidly deployable transit case-based troposcatter system, which has recently been purchased by the U.S. Army, has been incorporated into the SNAP family of products used by the U.S. military and called the Tactical Transportable TROPO ("SNAP 3T") or AN/TRC 198(V3). Numerous SNAP 3T terminals have been deployed by the U.S. Army in recent years and we believe that the U.S. Army intends to deploy a significant number of units in the future. We are currently developing next generation troposcatter modems that will provide significant reductions in size, weight and power as compared to currently available models. We believe these next generation modems will facilitate further market expansion over the next several years.
RF Power and Switching Technologies 
Our high-power solid-state amplifiers and related technologies are utilized in several critical applications including: electronic warfare, communications, radar, IFF and medical applications. We believe the demand for our RF power and switching technologies is growing. 
In the electronic warfare marketplace, we support legacy systems and are participating in the ongoing migration to platforms that require smaller and lighter amplifiers. We expect the U.S. DoD to fund initial proof of concept systems and fund production of small airborne platforms to meet the need for improved data link systems with manned and unmanned platforms. Our solutions increase the flexibility of systems by providing wider bandwidth capabilities to address communication needs.
We also believe that the desire for increased situational awareness of the airspace may create opportunities for our radar and IFF products, which are used by government customers around the world. Our high power and highly reliable GaN amplifier technology is increasingly being used both to update existing radar systems for improved sensitivity and range as well as for new radar installations. In addition to technologies that enhance performance of primary radars, we also supply solutions for IFF systems that provide positive identification of radar targets. Governing bodies are requiring the implementation of spectrum friendly systems which, in turn, is driving market need for new hardware for our advanced performance systems.
The medical industry is also making use of our technologies in oncology and hypothermic cancer treatment systems. These systems improve treatment precision, reduce marginal costs and allow for higher insurance reimbursement rates. These increased reimbursement levels are strong incentives to upgrade facilities with the latest available technologies.

Acquisitions
In the past, we have acquired businesses and enabling technologies.
Our most recent acquisition occurred on February 23, 2016, when we acquired TCS, a leading provider of commercial solutions (such as public safety systems and enterprise application technologies) and government solutions (such as command and control ("C4ISR") applications). The TCS acquisition had an aggregate purchase price for accounting purposes of $340.4 million (also referred to as the transaction equity value) and an enterprise value of $423.6 million. 
The TCS acquisition was the largest acquisition in our history and resulted in Comtech entering complementary markets and expanding our domestic and international commercial offerings. TCS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Comtech. Our financial results for each of fiscal 2018 and 2017 include a full year of TCS operations and for fiscal 2016 include approximately five months of TCS operations. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further discussion. Because our historical results prior to February 23, 2016 do not include TCS, you should not rely on period-to-period comparisons as an indicator of our future performance as these comparisons may not be meaningful.
In order to position ourselves to take advantage of additional growth opportunities and meet our strategic objectives, we have followed and will continue to follow a disciplined approach in identifying, executing and capitalizing on acquisitions.
Sales, Marketing and Customer Support
Sales and marketing strategies vary with particular markets served and include direct sales through sales, marketing and engineering personnel, indirect sales through independent representatives, value-added resellers, and sales through a combination of the foregoing. We devote resources to evaluating and responding to requests for proposals by governmental agencies around the world and, as needed, we employ the use of specialized consultants to develop our proposals and bids.
We intend to continue to expand international marketing efforts by engaging additional independent sales representatives, distributors and value-added resellers and by establishing additional foreign sales offices. In addition, we also leverage our relationships with larger companies (such as prime contractors to the U.S. government and large mobile wireless operators) to market our technology solutions.
We are pre-qualified as an approved vendor for certain government contracts, and some of our products and services are available to government customers via the General Services Administration’s Information Technology Schedule 70, GTACS, CS2, CS3 and the Space and Naval Warfare Foreign Military Sales contract vehicles. We collaborate in sales efforts under various arrangements with integrators. Our marketing efforts also include advertising, public relations, speaking engagements and attending and sponsoring industry conferences. 
Our management, technical and marketing personnel establish and maintain relationships with customers. Our sales strategies include a commitment to providing ongoing customer support for our systems and equipment. This support involves providing direct access to engineering staff or trained technical representatives to resolve technical or operational issues.
Our products and services in many of our product lines have long sales cycles. Once a product is designed into a system, customers may be reluctant to change the incumbent supplier due to the extensive qualification process and potential redesign required in using alternative sources. In addition, in recent years, we have found that overall sales cycles for each of our product lines have significantly increased.
Sales by geography and customer type, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, are as follows:

 | Fiscal Years Ended July 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016

Sales to U.S. government customers include sales to the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as sales directly to or through prime contractors. 
Domestic sales include sales to commercial customers, as well as to U.S. state and local governments. Included in domestic sales, are sales to Verizon Communications Inc. ("Verizon"), which represented 10.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018. Sales to Verizon were less than 10.0% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017 and 2016.
International sales for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $145.8 million, $156.5 million and $123.5 million, respectively. When we sell internationally, we denominate virtually all of our contracts in U.S. dollars. Some of our sales to international customers are paid for by letters of credit or on an open account. From time to time, some of our international customers may require us to provide performance guarantees. 
Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Backlog
Our backlog as of July 31, 2018 was $630.7 million (of which $403.1 million was attributed to the Commercial Solutions segment and $227.6 million was attributed to the Government Solutions segment). We expect that a significant portion of the backlog as of July 31, 2018 will be recognized as sales during fiscal 2019.
At July 31, 2018, 25.4% of our backlog consisted of U.S. government contracts, subcontracts and government funded programs, 21.9% consisted of orders for use by international customers (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers) and 52.7% consisted of orders for use by U.S. commercial customers.
Our backlog consists of orders (sometimes referred to herein as bookings) that we believe to be firm; however, almost all of the contracts in our backlog (including firm orders previously received from the U.S. government) are subject to modification, cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract. Backlog that is derived from U.S. government orders relates to U.S. government contracts that have been awarded, signed and funded. Backlog for our U.S. government customers also includes amounts appropriated by Congress and allotted to the contract by the procuring government agency. Our backlog does not include the value of options that may be exercised in the future on multi-year contracts, nor does it include the value of additional purchase orders that we may receive under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity ("IDIQ") contracts or basic ordering agreements.
In some cases, such as contracts received from large U.S. based telecommunication companies, our backlog is computed by multiplying the most recent month’s contract or revenue by the months remaining under the existing long-term agreements, which we consider to be the best available information for anticipating revenue under those agreements.
A significant portion of the backlog from our U.S. commercial customers relates to large, multi-year contracts to provide state and local governments (and their agencies) with safety and security solutions. Although the contracts themselves represent legal, binding obligations of these governments, funding is often subject to the approval of budgets (for example, on an annual or bi-annual basis). Although funding for these multi-year contracts are dependent on future budgets being approved, we include the full estimated value of these large, multi-year contracts in our backlog given the critical nature of the services being provided and the positive historical experience of our state and local government customers passing their respective budgets.
There can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period, or at all, or that any contract included in backlog will be profitable. There is a higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to unfunded backlog. The actual receipt and timing of any revenue is subject to various contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. The actual recognition of revenue on contracts included in backlog may never occur or may change because a program schedule could change, the program could be canceled, a contract could be reduced, modified or terminated early, funding may not be included in future budgets, or an option that we had assumed would be exercised is not exercised.
11

Variations in backlog from time to time are attributable, in part, to changes in sales mix, the timing of contract proposals, and the timing of contract awards and delivery schedules on specific contracts. A large majority of the solutions in our communication technologies product line operate under short lead times. Our Government Solutions segment backlog is highly influenced by the nature and timing of orders received from the U.S. government, which is subject to unpredictable funding, deployment and technology decisions. As a result, we believe our backlog and orders, at any point in time, are not necessarily indicative of the total sales anticipated for any particular future period. 
Manufacturing and Service
Our manufacturing operations consist principally of the assembly and testing of electronic products that we design and build from purchased fabricated parts, printed circuits and electronic components. We consider our facilities to be well maintained and adequate for current and planned production requirements. All of our manufacturing facilities, including those that serve the military market, must comply with stringent customer specifications. We employ formal quality management programs and other training programs, including the International Standard Organization’s quality procedure registration programs.
We operate a high-volume technology manufacturing center located in Tempe, Arizona. This manufacturing center is operated by our Commercial Solutions segment and can be utilized, in part, by our Government Solutions segment and by third-party commercial customers, including prime contractors to the U.S. government, who can outsource a portion of their product manufacturing to us. Increased usage of our high-volume technology manufacturing center allows us to secure volume discounts on key components, better control the quality of our manufacturing process and maximize the utilization of our manufacturing capacity.
Our ability to deliver products to customers on a timely basis is dependent, in part, upon the availability and timely delivery by subcontractors and suppliers (including, at times, the U.S. government) of the components and subsystems that we use in manufacturing our products. Electronic components and raw materials used in our products are generally obtained from independent suppliers. Some components are standard items and are available from a number of suppliers. Others are manufactured to our specifications by subcontractors. Although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources, we believe that most components and equipment are available from multiple sources. Certain U.S. government contracts may require us to incorporate government furnished parts into our products. Delays in receipt of such parts can adversely impact the timing of our performance on the related contracts.
Research and Development
We have established a leading technology position in our fields through internal and customer-funded research and development activities.
Internal research and development expenses are reported as research and development expenses for financial reporting purposes and were $53.9 million, $54.3 million and $42.2 million in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing 9.4%, 9.9% and 10.3% of total consolidated net sales, respectively, for these periods. Customer-funded research and development activities relate to the adaptation of our basic technology to specialized customer requirements which is recoverable under contracts and is reflected in net sales with the related costs included in cost of sales. Certain of our government customers contract with us from time to time to conduct research on telecommunications software, equipment and systems. During fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, we were reimbursed by customers for such activities in the amounts of $16.9 million, $27.1 million and $17.4 million, respectively.
Intellectual Property
We rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how, continuing technological innovation and, with respect to certain technologies, patents to develop and maintain our competitive position. The products we sell require significant engineering design and manufacturing expertise. For these technological capabilities that are not protected by patents or licenses, we generally rely on the expertise of our employees and our learned experiences in both the design and manufacture of our products and the delivery of our services.
Some of our key Commercial Solutions segment technology is protected by patents that are significant to protecting our proprietary technology. We have been issued several U.S. patents relating to forward error correction technology that is utilized in our TPC-enabled satellite modems. Due to our market leadership position, we do not expect that upon expiration of these patents, our future results will be negatively impacted. Our DoubleTalk® Carrier-in-Carrier® bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party.
12

We have a portfolio of several hundred patents worldwide relating to wireless location-based services, text messaging, GPS ephemeris data, emergency public safety data routing, electronic commerce and other areas. To-date, our strategy has been to avoid offensive and defensive patent litigation and focus on building meaningful partnerships with other companies through direct licensing, cross licensing, and other forms of agreements. We do not believe that any single patent or group of patents, patent application or patent license agreement is material to the Company’s operations.
We have filed additional patent applications for certain apparatus and processes we believe we have invented covering key features of the location services, wireless text alerts, SMS Center, mobile-originated data and E911 network software. There is no assurance that our patent applications will result in a patent being issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other patent offices, nor is there any guarantee that any issued patent will be valid and enforceable. Additionally, foreign patent rights may or may not be available or pursued in any technology area for which U.S. patent applications have been filed. 
Almost all of the products and services we sell to the U.S. government include technology and other technical know-how that we have internally developed. In past instances where we have provided government-purpose rights, to our knowledge, the U.S. government has not exercised any of these rights. To the extent that we have provided or will provide government-purpose rights in the future, we believe that given the rapidly changing nature of our technology, our future success will depend primarily on the technical competence and creative skill of our personnel, rather than any contractual protection.
Competition
Our businesses are highly competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change. Some of our competitors are substantially larger, have significantly greater financial, marketing, research and development, technological and operating resources and broader product lines than we have. Other companies are developing new technologies and the shift towards open standards such as IP-based satellite networks will likely result in increased competition. A significant technological breakthrough by others, including new companies, our existing competitors and our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our growth and financial condition depends on, among other things, our ability to keep pace with such changes and developments and to respond to the increasing variety of electronic equipment users and transmission technologies.
Some large defense-based companies, such as Northrop Grumman Corporation, have subsidiaries or divisions that compete against us in one or more business segments. In addition, new and potential competitors are always emerging. Certain of our customers, such as prime contractors who currently outsource their engineering and manufacturing requirements to us, have technological capabilities in our product areas and could choose to replace our products with products they develop. In some cases, we partner or team with companies (both large and mid-tier) to compete against other teams for large defense programs. In some cases, these same companies may be among our competitors.
Listed below, in alphabetical order, are some of our competitors in each of our two business segments: 
Commercial Solutions - Advantech Wireless Inc., CalAmp Corp., CPI International, Inc., Datum Systems, Inc., 8x8 Inc., Ericsson LM Telephone Co., Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd., Google Inc., Harris Corporation, Here Technologies, Honeywell Aerospace, iDirect, Inc., Infinite Convergence Solutions, Inc., Intermap Technologies Corp., Iridium Communications Inc., KVH Industries Inc., Motorola Solutions, Inc., Newtec, Nokia Networks, NovelSat, Orbcomm, Inc., Paradise Datacom LLC (a subsidiary of Teledyne Technologies, Inc.), Solacom Technologies Inc., Telenav, Inc., Tom Tom NV, ViaSat, Inc. and West Corporation.
Government Solutions - Aethercomm, Inc., CACI International Inc., CalAmp Corp., DB Control Corp. (a subsidiary of HEICO Corp.), DXC Technology, Empower RF Systems, Inc., General Dynamics Corporation, Harris Corporation, L3 Technologies, Inc., Mercury Systems, Inc., NeuStar, Inc., Northrop Grumman Corporation, Orbital ATK, Inc., Raytheon Company, Teledyne Technologies, Inc., The KEYW Holding Corporation, Ultra Electronics Holdings PLC and ViaSat, Inc.
We believe that competition in all of our markets is based primarily on technology innovation, product performance, reputation, delivery times, customer support and price. Due to our proprietary know-how, we believe we have the ability to develop, produce and deliver products and services on a cost-effective basis faster than many of our competitors.
13

Employees
At July 31, 2018, we had 1,852 employees (including temporary employees and contractors), 1,109 of whom were engaged in production and production support, 391 in research and development and other engineering support, and 352 in marketing and administrative functions. None of our U.S. based employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that our employee relations are good.
U.S. Government Contracts and Security Clearances
The U.S. government operates on an October-to-September fiscal year. Generally, in February of each year, the President of the United States presents to the U.S. Congress ("Congress") the proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year and from February through September of each year, the appropriations and authorization committees of Congress review the President’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. Once these levels are enacted into law, the Executive Office of the President administers the funds to the agencies. Thereafter, we can receive orders pursuant to sole-source or competitively awarded contracts, which we describe below.
The U.S. government may be unable to complete its budget process before the end of any given government fiscal year and when the fiscal budget is not approved in a timely manner, the U.S. government is required either to shut down or be funded pursuant to a so-called "continuing resolution" that authorizes agencies of the U.S. government to continue operations but does not authorize new spending initiatives, either of which could result in reduced or delayed orders or payments for products and services we provide.
Sole-source contracts are generally awarded to a single contractor without a formal competition when a single contractor is deemed to have an expertise or technology superior to that of competing contractors or when there is an urgent need by the U.S. government that cannot wait for a full competitive process. Potential suppliers compete informally through research and development and marketing efforts. Competitively-bid contracts are awarded based on a formal proposal evaluation established by the procuring agency and interested contractors prepare bids. Competitively-bid contracts are awarded after a formal bid and proposal competition among suppliers.
The U.S. government has a stated policy direction to reduce the number of sole-source contract awards across all procuring agencies. In addition, the U.S. government is increasing the use of multiple-award IDIQ contracts to increase its procurement options. IDIQ contracts allow the U.S. government to select a group of eligible contractors for the same program. When the government awards IDIQ contracts to multiple bidders under the same program, a company that has already competed to be selected as a participant in the program must subsequently compete for individual delivery orders. As a result of this U.S. government shift toward multiple award IDIQ contracts, we expect to face greater competition for future U.S. government contracts and, at the same time, greater opportunities for us to participate in program areas that we do not currently participate in.
As a U.S. government contractor and subcontractor, we are subject to a variety of rules and regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulations ("FAR"). Individual agencies can also have acquisition regulations. For example, the Department of Defense implements the FAR through the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation supplement (commonly known as "DFARs"). For all Federal government entities, the FAR regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition, including: acquisition planning, competition requirements, contractor qualifications, protection of source selection and vendor information, and acquisition procedures. In addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of supplier costs, while Cost Accounting Standards address how those costs can be allocated to contracts. The FAR also subjects suppliers to audits and other government reviews. These reviews cover issues such as cost, performance and accounting practices relating to our contracts. The government may challenge a supplier's costs and fees. Suppliers are also required to comply with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual which relates to requirements regarding classified materials and programs. Suppliers who do not comply with these various regulations may lose and/or become ineligible for facility security clearances and/or participation in classified programs.
Under firm fixed-price contracts, we perform for an agreed-upon price and we can derive benefits from cost savings, but bear the risk of cost overruns. Our cost-reimbursable type contracts typically provide for reimbursement of allowable costs incurred plus a negotiated fee. Cost-plus-incentive-fee orders typically provide for sharing with the U.S. government savings accrued from orders performed for less than the target costs and costs incurred in excess of targets up to a negotiated ceiling price (which is higher than the target cost), and for the supplier to carry the entire burden of costs exceeding the negotiated ceiling price. 
14

In fiscal 2018, $202.7 million or 35.5% of our consolidated net sales were to the U.S. government (including sales to prime contractors to the U.S. government). Of this amount, firm fixed-price and cost-reimbursable type contracts (including fixed-fee, incentive-fee and time and material type contracts) accounted for approximately $152.5 million and $50.2 million, respectively. 
15

Regulatory Matters
In addition to the rules and regulations that pertain to us as a U.S. government contractor and subcontractor, we are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal governmental regulations.
Our products that are incorporated into wireless communications systems must comply with various government regulations, including those of the FCC. Our manufacturing facilities, which may store, handle, emit, generate and dispose of hazardous substances that are used in the manufacture of our products, are subject to a variety of local, state and federal regulations, including those issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. Our products are also subject to European Union directives related to the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment. 
Our international sales are subject to U.S. and foreign regulations such as the Arms Export Control Act, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ("IEEPA"), the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR"), the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") as well as other applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary export licenses, and such failure would materially adversely affect our operations. If we are unable to receive appropriate export authorizations in the future, we may be prohibited from selling our products and services internationally, which may limit our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries. Certain of our products and systems may require licenses from U.S. government agencies for export from the U.S., and some of our products are not permitted to be exported. In addition, in certain cases, U.S. export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions, such as discussions with any persons who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. As a result, in cases where we may need an export license, our ability to compete against a non-U.S. domiciled foreign company that may not be subject to the same U.S. laws may be materially adversely affected. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other local laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to foreign governments or officials. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant sanctions, including disgorgement of profits, fines, and criminal sanctions against us, our officers, our directors, or our employees, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. A violation of any of the regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements which could further restrict our ability to deliver services to our international customers, including the addition of a country to the list of sanctioned countries under the IEEPA or similar legislation could negatively impact our business.
In the past, we have self-reported violations of ITAR to the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls ("DDTC") and had an ITAR compliance audit performed by an independent auditor at the request of the DDTC. Although the audit found no violations of ITAR, we committed to the DDTC that we would enhance and maintain certain policies and procedures and we have established a company-wide Office of Trade Compliance.
In October 2014, we disclosed to OFAC that we learned during a self-assessment of our export transactions that a shipment of modems sent to a Canadian customer by Comtech EF Data Corp. was incorporated into a communication system, the ultimate end user of which was the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority. The sales value of this equipment was approximately $288,000. At the time of shipment, OFAC regulations prohibited U.S. persons from doing business directly or indirectly with Sudan. In late 2015, OFAC issued an administrative subpoena seeking further information about the disclosed transaction. We have responded to the subpoena, including alerting OFAC to Comtech’s repair of three modems for a customer in Lebanon who may have rerouted the modems from Lebanon to Sudan without the required U.S. licensing authorization. Subsequently, in October 2017, U.S. sanctions with respect to Sudan were revoked. Consistent with the revocation of the Sudan Sanction Regulations ("SSR"), shipments to the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority by U.S. persons are now permissible. We are not able to predict when OFAC will complete its review, nor whether it will take any enforcement action against us in light of the recent revocation of the SSR. If OFAC determines that we have violated U.S. trade sanctions, civil and criminal penalties could apply, and we may suffer reputational harm. Even though we take precautions to avoid engaging in transactions that may violate U.S. trade sanctions, those measures may not be effective in every instance. 
16

In May 2018, we were informed by the Office of Export Enforcement ("OEE") of the Department of Commerce ("DoC") that it was forwarding to the DoC's Office of Chief Counsel, the results of its audit of international shipments by Comtech Xicom Technology, Inc. for further review and possible determination of an administrative penalty. We fully cooperated with the OEE in their audit and, based on our self-assessment of the approximately 7,800 individual transactions audited, have determined that six (6) transactions may not have been fully in compliance with the EAR. These six (6) items, for which export licenses were not obtained, were either spares or repaired power amplifier subassembly components valued at less than $100,000 (in aggregate) and were shipped to Brazil, Italy, Russia, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates. The EAR provides an exception to the requirement to obtain an export license for the replacement of a defective or damaged component. During our self-assessment, we determined that we inadvertently did not obtain export licenses for the spares, or had evidence of the return or destruction of the defective or damaged components necessary to authorize our use of the export license exception for the replacements. Since discovering this issue, we have implemented additional controls and procedures and have increased awareness of these specific export requirements throughout the Company to help avoid similar occurrences in the future. Administrative penalties under the EAR can range from a warning letter to a denial of export privileges. Given the lapsed legal status of the Export Administration Act ("EAA") itself, administrative penalties under the EAR are currently determined pursuant to the IEEPA, which can reach the greater of twice the amount of the transaction that is the basis of the violation or approximately $300,000 per violation. We have not recorded an accrual related to a possible administrative penalty and continue to work cooperatively with the OEE.
Our financial reporting, corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices are governed by laws such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, and rules and regulations issued by the SEC. The SEC has adopted rules which require, among other things, public companies to conduct certain inquiries to determine whether or not Conflict Minerals (as that term is defined in the SEC rules) that are necessary to the functionality of their manufactured products or their product's production processes originated in a Covered Country (as that term is defined in the SEC rules) and ultimately file a report with the SEC. Conflict Minerals are widely used in many industries, including the telecommunications industry and almost all of our products include component parts purchased from third party suppliers and we must rely heavily on information received from suppliers to determine the origin of those materials. We have implemented a due diligence program consistent with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines to collect information concerning the country of origin of Conflict Minerals and in that regard, have adopted a policy that requires our suppliers (both public and private) to commit to a code of conduct relating to the responsible sourcing of minerals and to establish a policy to reasonably assure that the products they manufacture do not contain Conflict Minerals that originated in a Covered Country. Efforts to comply with this SEC rule have resulted in additional costs to us and, we believe, to our suppliers. As such, the availability of raw materials used in our operations could be negatively impacted and/or raw material prices could increase. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage and could harm our reputation.
Recently, there has been a number of laws and regulations enacted that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, including the European General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). The GDPR imposes certain privacy related requirements on companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are currently different than those in the United States and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. Our costs to comply with the GDPR as well any other similar laws and regulations that emerge may negatively impact our business.
