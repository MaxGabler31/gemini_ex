 Overview
 MindMed is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel products to treat brain health disorders, with a particular focus on psychiatry, addiction, pain and neurology. Our mission is to be the global leader in the development and delivery of treatments that unlock new opportunities to improve patient outcomes. We are developing a pipeline of innovative drug candidates, with and without acute perceptual effects, targeting the serotonin, dopamine and acetylcholine systems. This specifically includes pharmaceutically optimized drug products derived from the psychedelic and empathogen drug classes including LSD, R(-)-MDMA and zolunicant, or 18-MC, a congener of ibogaine.
 Our lead drug candidate, MM-120, is a proprietary, pharmaceutically optimized form of lysergide, or LSD, and is being developed for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, or GAD. MM-120 is also being studied under various dosing regimens for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, and for the treatment of chronic pain. Phase 2 studies for MM-120 in GAD and ADHD are ongoing and a Phase 1/2 study of MM-120 in chronic pain is expected to begin in late 2022.
 Our next most advanced drug candidate, MM-110, which has the non-proprietary name zolunicant, is our proprietary form of 18-methoxycoronaridine, a congener of ibogaine, which is being developed for the treatment of opioid withdrawal. MM-110 is an α3β4 nicotinic cholinergic receptor antagonist that has been tested in preclinical models of withdrawal and substance use disorders. In those studies, MM-110 was shown to reduce signs of opioid withdrawal, and to reduce self-administration of opioids, stimulants and ethanol. We completed a Phase 1 study of MM-110 in late 2021 and plan to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial in opioid withdrawal in 2022.
 Our third drug candidate, MM-402, or R(-)-MDMA, is our proprietary form of the R-enantiomer of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), which we are developing for the treatment of core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. MDMA is a synthetic substance that is often referred to as an empathogen because it increases feelings of connectedness and compassion. Preclinical studies of R(-)-MDMA demonstrate its acute pro-social and empathogenic effects, while its diminished dopaminergic activity suggest that it will exhibit less stimulant activity, neurotoxicity, hyperthermia and abuse liability compared to racemic MDMA or the S(+)-enantiomer. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 study of MM-402 in 2023.
 Beyond our lead drug candidates, we have a number of earlier stage research programs, primarily through external collaborations, through which we seek to expand our drug development pipeline and broaden the potential applications of our lead drug candidates. These research programs include non-clinical, pre-clinical and human clinical trials and investigator initiated trials (IITs) of additional drug candidates and research compounds with our collaborators. Our external research programs include a broad multi-year exclusive research partnership with University Hospital Basel (UHB) in Switzerland. Under the partnership, we have exclusive worldwide rights to data, compounds and patent rights associated with UHB’s research on LSD and other compounds, including data from preclinical studies and seven completed and four ongoing LSD trials. In addition, we have engaged in other relevant research collaborations to support our ongoing development efforts. Our research partnerships and IITs facilitate the advancement of our early-stage pipeline and the data obtained supports the identification of product candidates for additional company-sponsored drug development programs. We also have an ongoing partnership agreement with MindShift Compounds AG to develop next-generation compounds with psychedelic and empathogenic properties, and with Nextage Therapeutics Ltd. to undertake a collaborative research and development program for applications of Nextage’s unique brain-targeted liposome drug delivery system (BTLS).
Our drug development strategy is closely complemented by a platform of digital medicine products that we are developing to facilitate adoption, use, and access to our products, if they receive regulatory approval and are marketed. In particular, we are developing multiple digital medicine products, including regulated software as a medical device, or SaMD, products as evidence-based therapeutic interventions for patients and healthcare providers to diagnose, prevent, manage or treat brain health disorders, or to facilitate the use of certain pharmaceutical products. We are also continuing to evaluate the potential to pair these SaMD products, which may include wearables and the latest in machine learning, with pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies to give healthcare providers the ability to optimize and better understand the patient journey and therapeutic outcomes from pre-care through after-care.

Our business is premised on a growing body of research supporting the use of novel psychoactive medications to treat a myriad of brain health disorders. For all product candidates, we intend to proceed through research and development, and with marketing of the product candidates that may ultimately be approved, if any, pursuant to the regulations of the FDA and other international regulatory authorities. This entails, among other things, conducting clinical trials with research scientists, using internal and external clinical drug development teams, producing and supplying drugs according to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, and conducting all trials and development in accordance with the regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other international regulatory authorities.
Our Strategy
 Our mission is to be the global leader in the development and delivery of treatments that unlock new opportunities to improve patient outcomes for brain health disorders. We intend to accomplish our mission by leading the field in (1) research, (2) development, (3) digital medicine, and (4) commercialization, scalability and patient access. Key elements of our strategy are to:
•advance our clinical pipeline and submit new drug applications, or NDAs, to the FDA, and conduct pre-launch activities with respect to any of our product candidates that have been successfully developed;
 •commercialize any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval, including the manufacture of commercial supplies;
 •continue our research and development efforts to evaluate the potential for our existing product candidates in the treatment of additional indications, in new formulations or with new delivery methods;
 •identify new targets, and generate and test new compounds and product candidates, with a focus on indications where we believe we can make well-informed, rapid go/no-go decisions, with the goal of developing a diversified portfolio of product candidates with differentiated features;
 •evaluate the market potential and regulatory pathways for our product candidates in the European Union, or EU, and other countries outside the United States, and determine how best to move forward where and when it may make business and strategic sense;
 •continue to advance digital medicine product development, including conducting ongoing and planned clinical trials of our Session Monitoring System and other clinical and regulatory activities with respect to development of both non-regulated and regulated-SaMD digital medicine products;
 •continue to build, maintain, defend, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio, including by utilizing the strengths of our proprietary chemistry platform and scientific know-how to expand our portfolio of new chemical entities to lessen our long-term reliance on the success of any one program and to facilitate long-term growth; and
 •continue to explore opportunities to establish agreements or alliances with other pharmaceutical companies, at the appropriate time, where we believe a collaboration will add significant value to our efforts, including through capabilities, infrastructure, speed or financial contributions, or to acquire new compounds, product candidates or products if we believe such opportunities will help us achieve our goals or meet other strategic objectives.


Our Drug Product Pipeline
 The following table summarizes the status of our product candidate-portfolio:
 
MM-120 (Lysergide (LSD) D-tartrate)
 MM-120 is MindMed’s proprietary drug candidate, a pharmaceutically optimized form of LSD being developed for GAD and other brain health disorders. LSD was first synthesized in 1938 and its psychoactive properties were discovered in 1943. From 1949 to 1966, LSD was used by psychiatrists and researchers to gain insights into the world of brain health and to assist psychotherapy. LSD has been investigated for its applications in the treatment of anxiety associated with terminal cancer, alcoholism, opioid use disorder, and depression, among other conditions.
 GAD is a chronic, often debilitating mental health disorder that affects approximately 6% of U.S. adults in their lifetimes. Symptoms of GAD include excessive anxiety and worry that persists for over six months, which can lead to significant impairments in social, occupational and other functioning, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). While there is substantial diagnostic overlap between GAD, Major Depressive Disorder, or MDD, and other major mental health disorders, there has been very little innovation focused on the treatment of GAD in the past several decades due to the shift in focus from anxiety disorders like GAD toward depressive disorders like MDD. Given the expansive body of evidence on the clinical effects of LSD across multiple brain health disorders, we are also exploring the therapeutic application of MM-120 in ADHD and in chronic pain, including the assessment of different dose levels and regiment and potentially different dosage forms to address unmet medical need in these therapeutic areas. In addition, there are a number of studies ongoing or planned to be conducted under our broad research collaboration with University Hospital Basel (UHB).
 As part of the development activities for MM-120, we plan to initiate and conduct three sponsored clinical trials in 2022:
•Study MMED008: A Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-finding study to assess the effect of four doses of MM-120 for the treatment of anxiety symptoms; 
 •Study MMED007: Safety and efficacy of repeated low dose lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) as treatment for ADHD in adults: a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a proof of concept trial; and 
 •A study of MM-120 in the treatment of chronic pain, which we expect to initiate in late 2022.
 MM-110 (18-methoxycoronaridine, zolunicant HC1)
 MM-110, orzolunicant, is our proprietary form of 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), a congener of ibogaine, being developed for the treatment of opioid withdrawal. MM-110 is a selective antagonist of α3β4 nicotinic cholinergic (nACh) receptors that indirectly modulates the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway by blocking α3β4 nicotinic receptors in the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway and the basolateral amygdala. MM-110 produces decreases in extracellular levels of dopamine (DA) and dopamine metabolites, DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) and HVA (homovanillic acid), in the Nucleus accumbens (NAc) brain region. MM-110 interferes with morphine-induced increases in dopamine in the NAc, and animal studies have demonstrated that MM-110 can significantly reduce drug self-administration of morphine, cocaine, methamphetamine, nicotine and alcohol. Additionally, MM-110

has been shown in animal models to attenuate the effects of environmental cues responsible for stimulating drug-seeking or “craving” behaviors and to ameliorate five of seven signs of opioid withdrawal.
 Opioid use disorder, or OUD, is a chronic, relapsing disease. The occurrence of withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation of opioid use coupled with intense drug craving—and the near immediate relief of these symptoms upon its resumption—make it difficult for those with OUD to complete detoxification and/or maintain abstinence from opioids. Relapse rates are particularly high in the first weeks following the initiation of detoxification. Drug craving is highly correlated with risk of subsequent opioid use both in patients receiving buprenorphine or methadone maintenance treatment and in the post-detoxification setting. Craving is a persistent and enduring feature of OUD, as evidenced by studies reporting that drug-related cues can induce cravings in former users of heroin who had been abstinent for a year or more. We believe that therapies such as MM-110 that better control craving while also mitigating other symptoms of withdrawal could substantially increase the number of patients who are able to complete detoxification and could also help prevent their early relapse to OUD.
We have completed a Phase 1 trial of MM-110 in late 2021, in which a total of 77 subjects were administered up to 325 mg of MM-110 twice (on a single day) or were administered up to 90 mg of MM-110 twice daily for seven days. We believe the results of this Phase 1 trial support the continued development of MM-110 and we expect to initiate a Phase 2 trial of MM-110 in opioid withdrawal in 2022.
MM-402 (R(-)-MDMA)
 MM-402, or R(-)-MDMA, is our proprietary form of the R-enantiomer of MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine), which we are developing for the treatment of core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. MDMA is a synthetic substance that is often referred to as an empathogen because it increases feelings of connectedness and compassion. Preclinical studies of R(-)-MDMA demonstrate its acute pro-social and empathogenic effects, while its diminished dopaminergic activity suggest that it will exhibit less stimulant activity, neurotoxicity, hyperthermia and abuse liability compared to racemic MDMA or the S(+)-enantiomer. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 study of MM-402 in 2023. Additionally, we are supporting the initiation of an IIT through our UHB research collaboration, which will compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of R(-)-MDMA, S(+)-MDMA and (+/-)-MDMA in normal healthy volunteers and is expected to start in 2022.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a biologically based neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction, and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. Estimates of the prevalence of ASD vary with study methodology and the population that is evaluated. The overall prevalence of ASD in Europe, Asia, and the United States ranges from 2 to 25 per 1000, or approximately 1 in 40 to 1 in 500. The pathogenesis of ASD is incompletely understood. The general consensus is that ASD is caused by genetic factors that alter brain development resulting in the neurobehavioral phenotype. Environmental and perinatal factors account for few cases of ASD but may modulate underlying genetic factors. Existing Psychopharmacologic agents do not treat autism itself and are largely oriented around treating coexisting psychiatric illnesses and reducing behavioral dysregulation.
Further Exploration of Novel Biopharmaceuticals and New Areas of Interest
 Beyond our lead drug candidates, we have several earlier research programs, primarily through external collaborations, through which we seek to expand our drug development pipeline and broaden the potential application of our lead drug candidates. These research programs include non-clinical, pre-clinical and human clinical trials, and IITs of novel biopharmaceuticals, both with and without perceptual effects, with our collaborators. Our partnered research programs include a broad multi-year exclusive research partnership with University Hospital Basel in Switzerland and a partnership with Maastrict University in the Netherlands. We also have an active partnership with MindShift Compounds AG develop and patent a portfolio of research compounds, both with and without perceptual effects, related to the phenethylamine, tryptamine, and ergoline chemical classes. Additionally, we have an ongoing collaborative research and development initiative with Nextage Therapeutics Ltd. to optimize the delivery of certain research compounds, including noribogaine, leveraging Nextage’s proprietary Brain Targeting Liposome System (BTLS) delivery technology. These research collaborations include IITs, drug discovery activities, advanced drug delivery activities and the advancement of other research activities that seek to support the growth and advancement of our product development programs.
Our Digital Medicine Product Pipeline
 Our drug development strategy is closely complemented by a platform of digital medicine products that we are developing to facilitate adoption, use, and access to our product candidates, if they receive regulatory approval and are marketed. In particular, we are developing multiple digital medicine products, including regulated software as a medical device, or SaMD products as evidence-based therapeutic interventions for patients and healthcare providers to diagnose, prevent, manage or treat brain health disorders, or to

facilitate the use of certain pharmaceutical products. We are also continuing to evaluate the potential to pair these SaMD products, which may include wearables and the latest in machine learning, with pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies to give healthcare providers the ability to optimize and better understand the patient journey and therapeutic outcomes from pre-care through after-care.
 Our digital projects are oriented around developing digital medicine candidates that will be applied to two primary clinical periods: activities during a treatment session (referred to as “intrasession”) and activities between treatment sessions (referred to as “intersession”). Each product candidate consists of a platform that contains separate underlying components, some of which we anticipate will be within the scope of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act’s definition of medical devices and others which we anticipate will not be regulated as medical devices. For the medical device products, we will engage with the FDA and other international regulatory authorities to receive guidance along the development pathway, culminating with a potential submission for regulatory clearance or approval. We expect that each medical device product candidate in development will be, for the purpose of FDA regulations, non-significant risk, Class I or Class II Software as Medical Device.
The intrasession monitoring platform may include components that provide in-session monitoring for safety, efficacy and additional interventions; clinician decision support for drug and non-drug therapeutic sessions; and predictive models linking interventions and treatment outcomes. The intersession monitoring platform may include components that support patient education, engagement, preparation and assistance; deep digital diagnosis that allows greater granularity to complement DSM diagnoses; support for treatment selection: modality dose and timing; real world monitoring of trends for relapse prediction and re-treatment decisions; engagement in health maintenance behaviors; and AI models to inform psychotherapeutic intervention. Within our intersession monitoring platform, we have current products that are being used in clinical studies for the detection and prediction of transdiagnostic agitation, opioid withdrawal for people with opioid use disorders, monitoring of acute and chronic pain and tracking symptoms and medication in Parkinson’s disease. We also have products for measurement of anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and pain that are either currently collecting clinical data (from existing data sources), or are collecting, or will collect data in planned and ongoing clinical studies. Regulatory engagements with FDA for the progression of regulated products took place in late 2021 and have continued into 2022.
 Manufacturing & Supply
 We neither own nor operate, and currently have no plans to own or operate, any manufacturing facilities. We currently source all of our clinical and non-clinical material supply through third party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs. We have also sourced our proprietary formulation of our drug candidates from CMOs, and intend to source all of our future supplies of our drug candidates from CMOs. All clinical supplies of drug substance and drug product are intended to be manufactured applying current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP.
We have established relationships with several CMOs under which the CMOs manufacture clinical and non-clinical supplies of drug substance and drug product for MM-120, MM-110, MM-402 and other research compounds and product candidates on a purchase order basis under master service and quality agreements. All clinical supplies of drug substance and drug product are intended to be manufactured under cGMP. Starting materials and key intermediates to support the production of these product candidates are manufactured by other CMOs. We do not currently have arrangements in place for either long-term supply or redundant supply of drug substance or drug product for MM-120, MM-110, MM-402 or other research compounds or product candidates. We intend to enter into a long-term supply agreement in place at the appropriate time for drug substance and drug product for each product candidate, if development continues. We plan to mitigate potential commercial supply risks for any products that are approved in the future through inventory management and through exploring additional manufacturers to provide drug substance or drug product.
Through our third-party manufacturers, we intend to refine and scale up the manufacturing process for our product candidates and manufacture clinical supplies as our development program progresses. We believe we currently have sufficient MM-120 and MM-110 drug substance for our ongoing trials and will have access and steady supply of drug substance for our planned and future Phase 2 clinical trials.
MM-120, MM-110 and MM-402 are small molecules isolated as stable crystalline solids. We believe the syntheses of these drug candidates are reliable and reproducible from readily available starting materials, and the synthetic routes are amenable to large-scale manufacturing and do not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to identify and develop drug candidates that are amenable to cost-effective manufacturing at contract manufacturing facilities.
Research Collaborations
 We have entered into several license agreements with respect to our clinical stage and preclinical product candidates and other research compounds, which are described below.
University Hospital Basel - Liechti Lab Initiatives - Research Collaboration & Exclusive License
On April 1, 2020, we entered into a multi-year, exclusive collaboration with Dr. Mattias Liechti’s lab at the University Hospital Basel (UHB), a world-leading psychedelics pharmacology and clinical research group based in Basel, Switzerland. Pursuant to the agreement, we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to data, compounds, and patent rights associated with the UHB Liechti Lab’s research with LSD and other psychedelic compounds, including data from preclinical studies and completed or ongoing LSD and MDMA clinical trials. Our ongoing research collaboration with the UHB Liechti Lab has generated a number of patent applications based on preclinical and clinical data generated over a 10-year period.
We support ongoing and planned research and development, or R&D, clinical trials and commercial development trials under the direction of Dr. Liechti. Dr. Liechti, as principal investigator, has primary responsibility for the research studies of the selected compounds. Subject to certain terms and conditions, the Company provides research funding and certain milestone payments in return for the exclusive license to existing and future data and intellectual property generated from clinical trials. Subject to terms and conditions, UHB Liechti Lab may receive royalties and development revenue on any products commercially marketed through the collaboration.
 MDMA Research
 Over the past ten years, the UHB Liechti Lab has led multiple clinical trials of the safety and pharmacodynamics of MDMA. The cumulative data from the research conducted by the UHB Liechti Lab helps inform the design of our sponsored clinical trials and the assessment of development opportunities for MDMA or its derivatives as potential future development programs in our portfolio. The Company continues to also fund additional R&D activities being pursued by the UHB Liechti Lab with the intention to continue to explore next-generation drug candidates, including those based on MDMA.
DMT Research
 We are also funding the UHB Liechti Lab to perform research on DMT, a short-acting serotonergic tryptamine of the psychedelic drug class. This includes a Phase 1 randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, five-period crossover trial in 30 healthy volunteers assessing various intravenous dosing regimens of DMT that began in July 2021. In order to potentially induce a stable DMT experience lasting one to two hours, various intravenous dosing regimens, including a starting dose and then a maintenance dose, are being evaluated in this Phase 1 IIT.
The human safety data and associated know-how gathered in this Phase 1 clinical trial will better enable our clinical team to design future potential product development programs based on DMT and could pave the way for future clinical trials of DMT or a derivative.
Ketanserin Research
 We have also funded a Phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, random-order, two-period crossover clinical trial evaluating the effects of ketanserin on the acute response to LSD in healthy subjects. This study is intended to provide insights into the pharmacological activity of LSD, the potential interaction between LSD and co-administration with serotonin antagonists.
Personalized Medicine Technology Research
 The company, in collaboration with UHB Liechti Lab, is also in the process of researching and developing technologies and analytics that will seek to personalize psychedelic therapy experiences. One such research effort aims to better characterize the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that impact administration of MDMA, LSD and other psychedelic compounds based on individual characteristics including age, gender, pharmacogenetics, personality traits, moods, metabolic markers and therapeutic drug monitoring. Through this collaborative research, we are seeking to advance our understanding of methods to predict and personalize the delivery of these compounds to enhance patient outcomes.

LSD Research
 Through our broad research collaboration with the UHB Liechti Lab, we have acquired exclusive rights to a body of historical and ongoing clinical trials assessing the clinical activity of LSD in several brain health disorders including anxiety, depression and cluster headaches.
The UHB Liechti Lab completed conduct of a study titled “LSD Treatment in Persons Suffering From Anxiety Symptoms in Severe Somatic Diseases or in Psychiatric Anxiety Disorders” assessing the efficacy of 200 micrograms LSD (two doses) versus placebo on anxiety and depression symptoms. Data analysis from the study is underway and we expect the UHB Liechti Lab to submit a manuscript of the study results for publication in 2022.
 We are also supporting a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating LSD for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The study is evaluating the potential effects of two doses of LSD on depression symptoms in patients suffering from major depressive disorder compared to a low dose (25 microgram, two doses) control group. The study is ongoing and UHB plans to include 60 patients over the age of 25 with major depressive disorder (according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (“DSM”). The study is expected to be completed in 2023 with results disseminated by publication thereafter.
 Additionally, in the area of neurology, we are supporting a Phase 2 IIT of LSD for the treatment of cluster headaches. Cluster headaches are a relatively uncommon primary headache disorder that is one of the trigeminal autonomic cephalgias; they are considered to be among the most severe forms of pain. The Phase 2 trial began recruiting patients in early 2019 and is evaluating the effects of LSD to mitigate signs and symptoms of cluster headaches in patients.
MindShift Compounds AG Initiatives
 In February 2021, we entered into a partnership agreement with MindShift Compounds AG to develop and patent a portfolio of research compounds, both with and without perceptual effects, related to the phenethylamine, tryptamine, and ergoline chemical classes. The objective of this partnership is to discover pharmaceutically optimized research compounds and/or product candidates. Drug discovery and synthesis activities by MindShift Compounds AG are ongoing and related patent applications have been and continue to be filed by MindMed. We anticipate that one or more of these research compounds could advance into an IIT through our collaboration with UHB as early as 2022.
 The partnership on these initial targets is aimed at expanding MindMed’s current well-established clinical pipeline. The related synthesis intellectual property and pharmaceutical technology will be owned outright by MindMed, and MindShift Compounds AG will provide all intellectual property related to the new psychedelic compounds exclusively to MindMed.
 Nextage Therapeutics, Ltd. Initiatives
 In 2021, we launched an exclusive collaboration with Nextage Therapeutics, Ltd., or Nextage, an Israeli innovative drug development company, to optimize the delivery of certain research compounds, leveraging Nextage’s proprietary Brain Targeting Liposome System (BTLS) delivery technology. Utilizing this technology, the company and Nextage are collaborating to develop a proprietary formulation of ibogaine derivatives, seeking to minimize the systemic exposure while maintaining effective concentrations in the brain, with the objective of improving the benefit-risk profile of their delivery.
Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary know-how and technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We may also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. To protect our rights to our proprietary know-how and technology, we require all employees, as well as our consultants and contract research organization, or CROs, when feasible, to enter into agreements that generally require disclosure and assignment to us of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by these employees, consultants, and CROs in the course of their service to us.
We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to compositions, methods of use, treatment and patient selection, formulations and manufacturing processes created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for

commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions, including the United States, permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing, or may in the future pursue, will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will be enforceable or provide sufficient protection from competitors.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by our issued patents, our pending patent applications or of patent applications we may file in the future. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, or similar proceedings outside the United States, to determine priority of invention.
Patent Strategy and Applications
 Our patent strategy includes pursuing protection for compositions of matter, methods of treatment, and diagnostic devices and analytics related to psychedelics. Our patent portfolio includes 26 pending U.S. applications, and 12 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications. Additionally, we plan to aggressively pursue patents in diagnostics with patient monitoring and analytics.
 We hold pending patent applications in the United States and also under PCT. Our intellectual property holdings include, but are not limited to:
 •U.S. and PCT applications covering compositions of matter and methods of treatment with 18-Methoxycoronaridine (18-MC) salt. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2040. 
 •U.S. and PCT applications covering compositions and methods of treating an individual with a psychedelic drug and reducing acute effects. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2041. 
 •U.S. and PCT applications covering methods of dosing and treating patients with a psychedelic with specific doses. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2041.
 •U.S. and PCT applications relating to LSD covering methods of treatment, analytical methods, compositions of matter, and dosage formulations. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2041 and 2042.
 •U.S. and PCT applications covering a method of enhancing positive effects of a psychedelic. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2041.
 •U.S. and PCT applications relating to MDMA covering methods of dosing MDMA in treating patients, methods of reducing adverse effects, and compositions of matter. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2041.
 •U.S. and PCT applications covering methods of treatment with DMT. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2041.
 •U.S. and PCT applications covering analytical methods with psilocybin. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2041.
 •Provisional applications relating to psilocin covering compositions of matter and methods of treatment. 
 •U.S. and PCT applications covering mescaline derivatives, and methods of treatment with mescaline and mescaline derivatives If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2042.
 •Provisional applications covering methods of treatment with various psychedelics.
 •Provisional applications covering systems and methods for monitoring patients and analyzing mental state.


Patent Term
The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the U.S. PTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.
The term of a U.S. patent may also be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug, and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, also have patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extension on patents covering those products, their methods of use, and/or methods of manufacture.
Trade Secrets
In addition to patents, we may rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Companies typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of their business that are not amenable to, or that they do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets, if any, and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, and, where feasible, with consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and certain other entities with whom we do business. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also generally provide that all relevant inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, designed to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
Competition
 The biopharmaceuticals industry is highly competitive. There are many public and private companies, universities, governmental agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates or address similar markets. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies similar to our products will increase.
Our most advanced development candidate, MM-120, is in Phase 2b development for GAD. Patients with GAD are typically treated with a variety of anxiolytic medications, including SSRIs, SNRIs and benzodiazepines. If successfully developed and approved, MM-120 may also face competition from esketamine, which is approved in the treatment of treatment resistant depression. A number of companies are developing product candidates intended for the treatment of GAD, including serotonin receptor agonists, such as deuterated DMT. In June 2021, Cybin, Inc. announced its intent to advance its deuterated DMT product, CYB004, in the treatment of anxiety disorders including GAD.
 Among other organizations working on novel biopharmaceuticals focused on modulation of the serotonin and dopamine systems, we also face competition from a number of companies, including ATAI Life Sciences, Compass Pathways, GH Research and others. ATAI is developing multiple product candidates that are in various phases of development for the treatment of psychiatric and substance use indications. Compass Pathways is developing COMP360 (a proprietary formulation of psilocybin) that is in Phase 3 clinical trials for treatment-resistant depression. GH Research is developing GH001, GH002 and GH003 that are in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for treatment-resistant depression. There are also many other public companies developing therapeutics from the psychedelic drug class at various stages of development.
 MM-110 is in Phase 2 development for the treatment of opioid withdrawal. If successfully developed and approved, MM-110 may face competition from lofexidine, which is approved for the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms, and clonidine, which is frequently used off-label for the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms.


MM-402, an enantiomer of MDMA with selective serotonergic activity, is in preclinical development for the treatment of core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). If successfully developed and approved, MM-402 may face competition from Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), which is developing (+/-)-MDMA in Phase 3 clinical trials for post-traumatic stress disorder and has previously conducted a pilot clinical trial of (+/-)-MDMA in ASD. There are also other companies developing serotonergic therapies for the treatment of ASD or related indications, including Nova Mentis and Mycrodose Therapeutics, which are collaborating on a transdermal psilocybin product candidate for the treatment of Fragile X syndrome.
 More broadly, there are numerous pharmaceutical companies developing or partnering to develop pharmaceutical products targeting the treatment of disorders in the areas of psychiatry, addiction, pain and neurology. This includes companies such as Novartis AG, Biogen, Otsuka Pharmaceuticals, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Sage Therapeutics and Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, among many others. Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. We expect competition in the indications we are pursuing will focus on efficacy, safety, convenience, availability, and price. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring/pharmacovigilance, safety and periodic reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed in a given jurisdiction, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained and/or generated, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and the drug must be approved by the relevant regulatory authority or authorities.
U.S. Drug Development
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, and local statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject a company to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s delay or refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold on a clinical investigation, warning or untitled letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and generally involves the following:
 •Completion of extensive nonclinical studies and testing, in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
 •Submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
 •Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, collectively referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each proposed indication;
 •Submission to the FDA of an NDA for marketing approval of a new drug;


•A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept and file the NDA for review;
 •Satisfactory completion of a potential FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •Potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
 •Payment of applicable user fees and FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.
 The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct development stages: nonclinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the nonclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal laws and regulations, including, for animal studies, the Animal Welfare Act and GLP. The sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND.
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted, but an IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocols for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials, including whether subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or to patients with the disease or condition being studied under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of, clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. GCPs include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any given clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols describing, among other details, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants, and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with, as applicable, regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study patients, following the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the U.S. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and compliance with informed consent principles, and FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.


Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three phases that may overlap, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.
 •Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
 •Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in patients afflicted with the target disease to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy.
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients afflicted with the target disease at multiple sites (typically from several hundred to several thousand subjects), and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended for drugs intended for chronic dosing to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, increased rates of serious suspected adverse events, or findings from other studies or from animal or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Success in one phase does not mean that the results will be observed in subsequent phases. Each phase may involve multiple studies. If concerns arise about the safety of the product candidate, the FDA or other regulatory authorities can stop clinical trials by placing them on a “clinical hold” pending receipt of additional data, which can result in a delay or termination of a clinical development program. The sponsoring company, the FDA, or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial, and may recommend suspension of a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, we must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 NDA and FDA Review Process
 The results of nonclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the U.S.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, the FDA may also issue a Written Request asking a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies related to a particular active moiety; if the sponsor agrees and meets

certain requirements, the sponsor may be eligible to receive additional marketing exclusivity for its drug product containing such active moiety.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, or PDUFA, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee, unless subject to a waiver. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA aims to complete its initial review of an NDA and respond to the applicant within 10 months from the filing date for a standard NDA and, and within six months from the filing date for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and integrity of the data submitted in the NDA. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. For example, the advisory committee may recommend or the FDA may determine that a REMS program is necessary to ensure safe use of the product. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The review and evaluation process for an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or one or more additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, non-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such additional data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 The FDA typically requires that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, and may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which may involve clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and/or efficacy and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if the FDA determines that a REMS is required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any limitations on approval, marketing or use for any of our products could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of those products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements if problems occur following launch, or if FDA determines that the product is no longer safe or effective.


Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has several programs that are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition and provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. Fast Track designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation are two of these programs and apply to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the development of the product and may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Breakthrough Therapy based on preliminary clinical evidence which meet the criteria outlined in the FDA’s programs. Under the Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy expedited programs, the FDA may review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete NDA is submitted if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.
 Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and offers a significant improvement in the safety and effectiveness of treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. Significant improvement may be shown by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months from the date of the NDA filing.
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if the product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening illness and provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. Accelerated approval for a product means that it may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug, such as:
 •distribution restricted to certain facilities or physicians with special training or experience; or
 •distribution conditioned on the performance of specified medical procedures.
 The limitations imposed would be commensurate with the specific safety concerns presented by the drug. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Pediatric Trials
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from non-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The FDA, if it learns of new information, may also request that the sponsor amend the initial PSP.
Post-marketing Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the Internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional non-clinical studies and clinical trials. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act.
 FDA regulations also require that approved products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
 Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, administrative enforcement, warning or untitled letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil penalties or criminal prosecution, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 Digital Therapeutics/Software as a Medical Device
 Software applications such as the digital therapeutics that we are developing may meet the definition of a medical device and be subject to FDA pre-market authorization, depending on their classification and software function. FDA guidance adopts international principles established by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum for the clinical evaluation of software as a medical device, or SaMD, which refers to software that is intended to be used for one or more medical purposes that perform these purposes without being part of a hardware medical device. We expect that our digital therapeutics in development will be, for the purpose of FDA regulations, non-significant risk, Class I or Class II medical devices. Clinical decision support, or CDS, software, is exempt from the definition of a medical device, or under FDA guidance, is subject to a policy of enforcement discretion.
Other Regulatory Matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the U.S., the Department of Health and Human Services; the U.S. Department of Justice; the DEA; the Consumer Product Safety Commission; the Federal Trade Commission; the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; the Environmental Protection Agency; and state and local governments.

In the U.S., arrangements and interactions with health care professionals, third-party payors, patients and others will expose us to broadly applicable anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims and other health care laws and regulations. These broadly applicable laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements or
 relationships through which we sell, market and distribute our approved product and any future products that may obtain marketing approval. In the U.S., federal and state health care laws and regulations that may affect our operations include:
 •The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a company marketing a prescription drug (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward the referral of an individual or purchase, lease or order, or the arranging for or recommending the purchase or order, of a particular item or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Liability under the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, advisors, or speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, charitable donations, product support and patient assistance. Violations of this law may be punishable by up to ten years in prison, criminal fines, damages, administrative civil money penalties, and the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
 •The federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the federal government or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Many pharmaceutical manufacturers have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper activities. The government may deem companies to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our activities relating to the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation may include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant civil penalties for each separate false or fraudulent claim, and the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
 •Numerous federal and state laws, including state data breach notification laws, state health information and/or genetic privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and the California Consumer Privacy Act), govern the collection, use, and disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability, private litigation, or adverse publicity. In addition, we or our collaborators may obtain health information from third parties, such as hospitals, healthcare professionals, and research institutions, that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and its implementing regulations, or collectively, HIPAA. HIPAA imposes privacy and security obligations on covered entity health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, as well as their “business associates” – independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. Although we are not directly subject to the HIPAA information privacy and security provisions – other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits – we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we or our agents knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. In addition, HIPAA does not replace federal, state, or other laws that may grant individuals even greater privacy protection.
 •The HIPAA fraud provisions, which impose criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or 


representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 •The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held in the company by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.
 •Analogous state and local laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, regardless of the payor. We also may become subject to other state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to clinical trials, or information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws and local ordinances that require identification or licensing of sales representatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Substantial resources are necessary to ensure that our business arrangements and interactions with health care professionals, third party payors, patients and others comply with applicable health care laws and regulations. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law, and if we are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, imprisonment, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.
 Numerous other laws may apply to our products. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to herein as the ACA (addressed further below in the section on “U.S. Healthcare Reform”). If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Many states impose various requirements on pharmaceutical manufacturers to report development costs and pricing information when prices are increased. Penalties for late or faulty reporting can reach $10,000 per day. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the CSA and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act.
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, issuance of warning or untitled letters, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs’ attorneys have been and will likely continue to be active in this space. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.


Many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Many of the state laws enable a state attorney general to bring actions and provide private rights of action to consumers as enforcement mechanisms. There is also heightened sensitivity around certain types of health information, such as sensitive condition information or the health information of minors, which may be subject to additional protections. Compliance with these laws is difficult, constantly evolving, and time consuming. Changes in statutes, regulations or the interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, if any, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, or the testing phase, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, or the approval phase. This patent term restoration period may be reduced by the FDA if it finds that applicant did not act with due diligence during the testing phase or the approval phase. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if circumstances permit, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our then owned or licensed patents, if any, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. Even if, at the relevant time, we have a valid issued patent covering our product, we may not be granted an extension if we were, for example, to fail to apply within applicable deadlines, to fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise to fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, and we do not have any other exclusivity, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration and our ability to generate revenues could be materially adversely affected.
 Some of our products may also be entitled to certain non-patent-related data exclusivity under the FDCA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, or NCE. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA may not be submitted by another company for another drug containing the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA Orange Book by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a full NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. Three-year exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications that rely on the information that served as the basis of granting three-year exclusivity. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations, and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
European Union Drug Development
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the U.S., medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory authorities in the EU has been obtained.
 Similar to the U.S., the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the EU Clinical Trials Regulation, introduces a complete overhaul of the existing

regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU, including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of medicinal products, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results.
In the EU, pediatric data or an approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, or waiver, is required to have been approved by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, prior to submission of a marketing authorization application to the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU Member States. In some EU countries, we may also be required to have an approved PIP before we can begin enrolling pediatric patients in a clinical trial.
 European Union Drug Review and Approval and Post-marketing Requirements
 In the EEA (which is comprised of 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after a related marketing authorization has been granted. Marketing authorization for medicinal products can be obtained through several different procedures. These are through a centralized, mutual recognition procedure, decentralized procedure, or national procedure (if marketing authorization is sought for a single EU Member State). The centralized procedure allows a company to submit a single application to the EMA. If a related positive opinion is provided by the EMA, the European Commission will grant a centralized marketing authorization that is valid in all EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Associations countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), all of whom make up the EEA.
 The UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit, has created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU. The impact of Brexit on the ongoing validity in the UK of current EU authorizations for medicinal products, whether granted through the centralized procedure, decentralized procedure, or mutual recognition, and on the future process for obtaining marketing authorization for pharmaceutical products manufactured or sold in the UK remains uncertain.
 The EU centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance that is not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which grant of centralized marketing authorization is in the interest of patients in the EU.
 The decentralized authorization procedure permits companies to file identical applications for authorization to several EU Member States simultaneously for a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any EU Member State. The competent authorities of a single EU Member State, the reference member state, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. The competent authorities of the other EU Member States, the concerned member states, are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territories on the basis of this assessment. The only exception to this is where an EU Member State considers that there are concerns of potential serious risk to public health related to authorization of the product. In these circumstances, the matter is submitted to the Heads of Medicines Agencies for review. The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU Member State to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU Member States.
 The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application in the EU is 210 days, not including clock stops during which applicants respond to questions from the competent authority. The initial marketing authorization granted in the EU is valid for five years. The authorization may be renewed and valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority or the European Commission decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. The renewal of a marketing authorization is subject to a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of the product by the national competent authorities or the EMA.
 The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with the EU’s pharmacovigilance legislation. This includes requirements to conduct pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products.
 Various requirements apply to the manufacturing and placing on the EU market of medicinal products. Manufacture of medicinal products in the EU requires a manufacturing authorization, and import of medicinal products into the EU requires a manufacturing authorization allowing for import. The manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, including the manufacture of APIs outside of the

EU with the intention to import the APIs into the EU. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. Marketing authorization holders and/or manufacturing authorization holders and/or distribution authorization holders may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of manufacturing authorization, in case of non-compliance with the EU or EU Member States’ requirements applicable to the manufacturing of medicinal products.
 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of medicinal products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians and other healthcare professionals, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. For example, applicable laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities in connection with a marketing authorization approval. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the product. Promotional activity that does not comply with the SmPC is considered off-label and is prohibited in the EU. Breaches of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, which may include fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of medicinal products to the general public and may also impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
 European Union Regulatory Data Exclusivity
 In the EU, innovative medicinal products that are subject to marketing authorization on the basis of a full dossier and do not fall within the scope of the concept of global marketing authorization qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The concept of global marketing authorization prevents the same marketing authorization holder or members of the same group, or companies that have concluded tacit or explicit agreements concerning the marketing of the same medicinal product, from obtaining separate data and market exclusivity periods for medicinal products that contain the same active substance. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application or biosimilar application for eight years from the date of authorization of the innovative product, after which a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced. However, the generic product or biosimilar products cannot be marketed in the EU for a further two years thereafter. The overall ten-year period may be extended for a further year to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
European Union Data Protection
 EU Member States and other jurisdictions where we may in the future operate have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became applicable on May 25, 2018, replacing the EU Data Protection Directive, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may interpret the GDPR and applicable related national laws differently and impose requirements additional to those provided in the GDPR. In addition, guidance on implementation and compliance practices may be updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EEA.
 Legal mechanisms to allow for the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S. have been challenged in the European Court of Justice. In 2016, the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce put in place the EU U.S. “Privacy Shield,” which was subsequently relied on by some U.S. companies to transfer data to the U.S. However, on July 16, 2020 the European Court of Justice ruled the Privacy Shield to be invalid. As a result, companies may no longer rely on the Privacy Shield as a basis on which to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S. U.S.-based companies are permitted to rely on other authorized means and procedures to transfer personal data provided by the GDPR. However, the most common authorized procedure to transfer personal data out of the EU, the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses may, as a result of the European Court of Justice’s judgement of July 16, 2020, also come under increased scrutiny. Following the European Court of Justice’s ruling, the European Data Protection Board issued a statement providing among other things that it is a primary responsibility of the exporter and the importer, when considering whether to rely on Standard Contractual Clauses to export data from the EU to third countries, to ensure that these third countries maintain a level of protection that is essentially equivalent to that guaranteed by the GDPR in light of the EU Charter of Human Rights. Companies may need to revise their Standard Contractual Clauses in light of the July 16, 2020 judgement. Companies that have not taken steps to demonstrate that their Standard Contractual Clauses and personal data recipients in the U.S.

are suitable to transfer to receive the personal data may be subject to enforcement actions by competent authorities in the EU for failure to comply with related data privacy rules.
 In addition, the privacy and data security landscape in the EU continues to remain in flux. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which was signed on December 30, 2020, provides that personal data can continue to flow freely from the EEA to the UK for a limited specified period of time. The agreement provides for a transition period of six months starting January 1, 2021. During this period personal data may, in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR, flow from the EEA to the UK and from the UK to the EEA. If the European Commission does not adopt an adequacy decision concerning the level of data protection in the UK within this six month period, any potential flows of personal data between the EEA and the UK will subsequently be subject to the same restrictions as those imposed on other third countries.
 The GDPR has introduced additional data protection obligations that can have specific impact on the conduct of clinical trials in the EEA. This includes obligations concerning the rights of patients in relation to their personal data collected during the clinical trials and the need to conclude arrangements with clinical trials sites concerning data processing activities.
 Rest of the World Regulation
 For other countries outside of the U.S. and EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 Approval by a regulatory authority in one jurisdiction does not guarantee approval by comparable regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements applicable to a given country, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in such country if we choose to seek such approval, or we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 U.S. Healthcare Reform
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Changes in government legislation or regulation and changes in private third-party payors’ policies toward reimbursement for our products, if successfully developed and approved, may reduce reimbursement of our products’ costs to physicians, pharmacies, patients, and distributors. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results for products, if any, we commercialize in the future.
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
 Any product candidates we successfully commercialize, if approved, in the future depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, which are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. In the U.S., healthcare providers are reimbursed for covered services and products through Medicare, Medicaid, and other government healthcare programs, as well as through commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 In addition, in many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU Member States have the power to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the

prices of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S., and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 In various EU Member States, we expect to be subject to continuous cost-cutting measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative.
Controlled Substances
 The federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and its implementing regulations establish a “closed system” of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA is the federal agency responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce.
 The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules—Schedule I, II, III, IV or V—with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence.
Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies) and controlled substance schedule(s).
 The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances. Imports of Schedule I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from a domestic supplier or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration, importers and exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I and II substance or Schedule III, IV and V narcotic, and submit import or export declarations for Schedule III, IV and V non-narcotics. In some cases, Schedule III non-narcotic substances may be subject to the import/export permit requirement, if necessary, to ensure that the United States complies with its obligations under international drug control treaties.
 For drugs manufactured in the United States, the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for the amount of substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial needs. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies.
 The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State authorities, including boards of pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.


U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.
