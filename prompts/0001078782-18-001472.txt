Item 1. Business
Background
 
We are a start-up, lithium exploration mining company whose purpose is to explore mineral properties which, hopefully, will contain lithium and other economic minerals. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 6, 2011 for the purpose of acquiring rights to mineral properties with the eventual objective of being a producing mineral company, if and when it ever occurs. We have limited operating history and have not yet generated or realized any revenues from our activities. Our principal executive offices are located at 930 Tahoe Blvd., Suite 802-16, Incline Village, NV 89451.
 
Currently, the Board of Directors (consisting of Mr. Douglas Cole, Mr. Douglas MacLellan and Mr. William Hunter) are involved in guiding the Company though a significant management reorganization and to reorient the company’s goals and objective to solely focus on the exploration and development of Lithium (Li) and other battery metal deposits in the State of Nevada, primarily through new capital commitments which Mr. Cole is actively seeking.
 
On August 8, 2016, the Company formed Lithortech Resources Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to serve as its operating subsidiary for lithium resource exploration and development. On June 29, 2018, the Company changed the name of Lithortech Resources to LithiumOre Corp. (“LithiumOre”). LithiumOre currently has mining claims on 26,000 acres in the area known as the Western Nevada Basin, situated in Railroad Valley in Nye County, Nevada (the “WNB Claim”). In the second half of 2017, we engaged experts to evaluate the region and the WNB Claim to target on-site exploration efforts and determined that 260 claims of the WNB Claim were appropriate for the Company’s planned exploration, which we expect to begin in the first half of 2019. With many features similar to Clayton Valley and with no exploration work targeting lithium to date, Railroad Valley represents a new and untested target for lithium brine. The Railroad Valley brine exploration can build on both the dense existing oil field data and the experiences at Clayton Valley and other Lithum brine basins to target potential brine aquifers. Please see the Company’s website for more information: www.lithiumore.net. 
 
The growth in demand for lithium batteries is predicted by industry researchers to outpace lithium production in the coming decade. Lithium-ion batteries for the automotive industry are expected to advance demand beyond current supply. These industry trends support and validate the Company’s new business model.
 
The Company is currently a pre-revenue organization and we do not anticipate earning revenues until such time as we have undertaken sufficient exploration work to identify Lithium and or other battery metals reserves. Exploration work will take several years and there is no certainty we will ever reach a production stage. Our Company is considered to be in the exploration stage due to not having done exploration work which would result in a development decision.
 
We own no real estate, other than mineral rights in the Nye County properties located in Nevada, United States. On March 19, 2018, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to purchase an additional 120 acres in Railroad Valley, NV for possible future exploration. The purchase is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2019. In the meantime, the Company has entered into a short-term lease agreement for this property to allow mineral testing prior to the completion of the property purchase.
 
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:
 

allowance to provide only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure; 
 
reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 
 
no non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 
 
exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.

We may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years (ending on September 30, 2019) or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering (our “IPO”); (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting requirements in this prospectus. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you have beneficial ownership. In addition, we have elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the Exchange Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates.
 
Market and Industry
 
Lithium is extracted from primarily two sources: pegmatite crystals and lithium salt from brine pools. Currently, the world’s five top producers of Lithium are located in Australia, Chile, Argentina, China, and Zimbabwe.
 
In 2017, worldwide Lithium production totaled approximately 43,000 metric tons, with the top 3 countries contributing roughly 89% of the global production. Most of the world’s lithium supply is produced by three companies: FMC Corporation, Sociedad Quimicay Minera de Chile (SQM) and the Albemarle Corporation.
 
Much of the current production of Lithium in Australia is derived from conventional mining techniques of ancient Precambrian rocks containing Lithium ore which is crushed and fed into capital intensive processing plants which upgrade the lithium mineral using gravity, flotation, magnetic and roasting purification processes.
 
Alternatively, Lithium production from Chile and Argentina uses a much less capital intense extraction method. Lithium is located beneath various salt flats. The Lithium is leached from nearby source rocks and becomes concentrated in salty brines just under the surface. The Lithium enriched brines are then pumped up to settle on hundreds of shallow surface evaporation pools which produces a thicker Lithium rich liquid. That liquid is treated with sodium carbonate, which creates lithium carbonate.
 
Lithium is a soft silver-white metal. With an atomic number of 3, it is the lightest of the all metals, only the gases Hydrogen (atomic number 1) and Helium (atomic number 2) are lighter.
 
Light weight Lithium has many applications but the metal is a perfect replacement of the much heavier Nickel used in most large batteries. Lithium batteries also have a high charge density, a longer life and lithium-ion batteries are rechargeable.
 
The Lithium market has typically been dominated by the ceramic and medical sectors, however, 2015 presented a marked change in the market as the demand for Lithium for the battery market outstripped any other sector.
 
At the moment, the primary lithium-ion battery manufacturers are: CATL, BYD, and OptimumNano Energy Co. Ltd. of China, Panasonic of Japan, and LG Chem of South Korea.
 
Lithium is not currently traded on any commodity exchanges, but rather is usually distributed in a chemical form such as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and sold directly to end users for a negotiated price per ton of Lithium carbonate. Recently that price has spiked, exceeding expectations and is projected to continue to rise due to increased demand.
 
General Market Analysis
 
Lithium-ion batteries have become the rechargeable battery of choice in cell phones, computers, electric cars and now larger scale electric storage. The growth in demand for lithium batteries is predicted to far outpace lithium production in the coming decade; in particular, Lithium-ion batteries for the automotive industry is expected to continue to drive demand beyond supply.
 
Recently, Japan and South Korea have both recorded high levels of Lithium-ion battery exports in as auto companies’ ramp up battery consumption to power all-electric vehicle sales. Lithium ion battery shipments from Japan, the world’s leading electric vehicle producer topped 33,500 tons in 2016, an increase of 31% year to year.
 
Goldman Sachs predicted that the market consumption could very well triple from the current production by 2025. Just a 1% increase of Electric Vehicles hitting the market could increase lithium demand by roughly half of the current production of lithium today.
 
SQM’s CEO Patricio de Solminihac said in a 2018 interview with Reuters that the company would invest $525 million in order to expand its lithium production in Chile through 2021, due to the high demand for electric vehicle batteries.

FMC and Albemarle have decided not to wait either. FMC announced in May 2017 it would triple its production of lithium hydroxide by 2019, increasing to 30,000 tons from 10,000. Albemarle also announced it would be increasing production of lithium carbonate to 70,000 tons from 24,000 over a few years.
 
Tesla’s mile long Gigafactory started producing powerful Lithium-ion batteries in January 2017 with its partner Panasonic. The Gigafactory will supply batteries for the 500,000 cars Tesla hopes to produce by the end of the decade, as well as to power homes. Also, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford, GM, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saturn, Tesla and Toyota have all announced plans to build lithium-ion battery powered cars.
 
After Tesla released the Model 3 in July 2017, there have been over 500,000 reservations for the vehicle and production is starting 2 years ahead of schedule. Elon Musk has stated that Tesla will have to acquire the entire lithium market to meet the current demands.
 Thus, the global lithium market is approaching shortages, which has made it a useful commodity and mineral explorers have launched efforts to locate and bring new suppliers to the marketplace.
 
Lithium brine exploration and development has proven to be much more cost effective and faster to be put into production than the hard rock mine counterparts.
 
Lithium brine deposits are considered placer deposits and are easier to gain mining permits. Brine is also a liquid which means that drilling to find it is more akin to drilling for water or oil. It’s also typically located relatively close to surface, which limits the depth of required drilling. Once a Lithium Brine is found, the reserve data is more straightforward to understand and quantify.
 
As the brines are found in large flat areas, the construction of numerous flat evaporation pools or direct solvent extraction can be achieved at relatively low cost. Environmental impact is minimized as the excess residual brines can be pumped back into the salt flats.
 
Competition
 
Oroplata competes with other companies searching for minerals in Nevada and seeks financing for the development of their specific properties. Often, but not in all cases, these other mineral companies are better financed, have properties which have had sufficient exploration work done on them to warrant a future investor to consider investing in their company rather than ours. There are only a limited number of investors willing to invest in a company which had no proven reserves and has just started its exploration work. These other mineral exploration companies might induce investors to consider their properties and not ours. Hence, any additional funds they receive will be directed to the future exploration work on their properties whereas our company might be strapped for funds and unable to do any worthwhile exploration work on the Western Nevada Basin claim. We might never be able to compete against these other companies and hence never bring the Western Nevada Basin project into a stage where a production decision is to be made. In addition, we will have to compete with both large and small exploration companies for other resources we will need; professional geologists, transportation to and from the Western Nevada Basin Project, materials to set up a camp if required and supplies including drill rigs.
