Lucky Tail operates from our Clearwater, Florida location with sales and marketing driven by on-site and remote teams that operate the Amazon sales strategy and daily business operations

HAVZ, LLC, d/b/a/ Steam Wholesale operates manufacturing and/or distribution centers in Las Vegas, Nevada supporting our health and wellness products, including those products manufactured with hemp ingredients and our overall distribution operations. We have continued to manage these operations with our corporate focus moving towards other larger opportunities and investments for the future.

In the United States, hemp products that are manufactured by Upexi are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), and various state agencies within the individual States. As an initial matter, the hemp products manufactured and distributed by Upexi must meet the requirements of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (the “Farm Bill”). Under the Farm Bill, all hemp products must contain no more than 0.3% of 9-delta-tetraydrocannabidiols (“9-delta”) on a dry weight basis. To ensure compliance with this provision, Upexi requires all hemp products it manufactures and distributes to contain no more than 0.3% of all tetraydrocannabidiols not simply 9-delta. The Farm Bill also requires that Upexi only use hemp [manufacturers/producers] that are duly licensed under state law or pursuant to the regulations issued by the USDA. Consequently, the Company processes, develops, manufactures, and sells its products pursuant to the Farm Bill. CBD products manufactured and distributed by Upexi Inc. must also meet the requirements of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the federal Food and Drug Administration’s (the “FDA”) regulations implementing the FDCA. While neither the FDCA nor FDA has specific provisions that relate to the marketing of hemp products, the products are subject to the general adulteration and labeling provisions of the FDCA and FDA’s regulations depending on whether the product is marketed as a cosmetic, dietary supplement or food. The permissibility of hemp products containing cannabinoids remains in a state of flux. The FDA has issued guidance titled “FDA Regulation of Cannabis and Cannabis-Derived Products, Including Cannabidiol (CBD)” pursuant to which the FDA has taken the position that cannabidiol (“CBD”) is prohibited from use as an ingredient in a food or beverage or as a dietary ingredient in or as a dietary supplement based on several provisions of the FDCA. In the definition of “dietary supplement” found in the FDCA at Section 201(ff), an article authorized for investigation as a new drug, antibiotic, or biological for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, is excluded from the definition of dietary supplement. A similar provision in the FDCA at 301(ll) makes it a prohibited act to introduce or deliver into commerce any food with a substance that was investigated as a new drug prior to being included in a food. There are no similar exclusions for the use of CBD in non-drug topical products, as long as such products otherwise comply with applicable laws. The FDA created a task force to address the further regulation of CBD and other cannabis-derived products and is currently evaluating the applicable science and pathways for regulating CBD and other cannabis-derived ingredients. Additionally, various states have enacted state-specific laws pertaining to the handling, manufacturing, labeling, and sale of CBD and other hemp products. Compliance with state-specific laws and regulations could impact our operations in those specific states. It is important to note that FDA has not taken any specific positions regarding the regulatory status of other cannabinoids, for example CBDA, CBDG, and CBDN. Finally, the Federal Trade Commission is the agency that is vested with ensuring that all marketing claims for hemp products are truthful and non-misleading.

Our Products

Upexi is a multi-faceted brand owner with established brands in the health, wellness, pet, beauty and other growing markets. We operate in emerging industries with high growth trends and look to drive organic growth of our current brands. We focus on direct to consumer and Amazon brands that are scalable and have anticipated, high industry growth trends. Our goal is to continue to accumulate consumer data and build out a significant customer database across all industries we sell into. The growth of our current customer database has been key to the year over year gains in sales and profits. To drive additional growth, we have and will continue to acquire profitable Amazon and eCommerce businesses that can scale quickly and reduce costs through corporate synergies. We utilize our in-house, SaaS programmatic ad technology to help achieve a lower cost per acquisition and accumulate consumer data for increased cross-selling between our growing portfolio of brands

The global ecommerce growth rate for 2022 is forecast at 12.2 percent, bringing global ecommerce sales worldwide to $5.542 trillion. Online shopping trend is expected to grow 50 percent in the US in the next few years. Ecommerce sales there are forecast to increase by a whopping 50 percent from $907.9 billion in 2022 to $1.4 trillion in 2025. The industry saw exponential growth during the pandemic, as consumers were more apt to buy online than go into stores, but while the CAGR has dipped from 2020, the industry continues to grow steadily. 

The market, customers and distribution methods for eCommerce products are large and diverse. While Amazon remains the largest eCommerce channel, others are carving out a big chunk of the market, including Walmart, eBay, and Etsy. More opportunities are popping up for sellers as well. Being able to navigate multiple marketplaces is a key to our success and helps reach different demographics and consumers with specific buying behaviors. 

Each of our brands creates new opportunities for us to target additional markets and consumers. Our goal through this diverse portfolio is to create products that can be cross-sold between brands to help take advantage of our growing list of consumer data. 

Our target customers are first and foremost end consumers via internet sales, however, we see growth opportunities in direct-to-consumer retail stores, cooperatives, affiliate sales and master distributors. As we continue to develop our business, these markets may change, be re-prioritized or eliminated as management responds to consumer and regulatory developments.

Our Competitive Strengths

We attribute our success to our diverse portfolio of consumer products. 

Diversification of Product Offerings. As an aggregator, our research and development team carefully tracks the growth rates for various consumer products, which serves as the first means of identifying profitable brands that have significant opportunities for scale. While many companies continue to spend on growth at all costs, we have spent to increase our profitability and build a foundation for profits in the toughest of times. We remained patient when other aggregators were over-extending their means which has provided us for better opportunities at more favorable valuations. 
Advertising Technology. We understand that advertising and consumer data is the key to growth when it comes to any eCommerce business. Our investment in such technology helps lowering our advertising costs, while providing a revenue stream from others who we outsource this programmatic SAAS to. This ownership of data allows us to help cross-sell any brand we acquire or launch. 
Logistical Expertise. Our executive team comes from a background in logistics, with CEO, Allan Marshall, the founder of XPO Logistics (formerly known as Segmentz, Inc.). With increased shipping costs affecting online retailers, our strength is understanding this and finding ways to lower or costs and overhead, thus increasing profit margins on all of our products. 
Liquidation Markets. Resellers on and off Amazon represent a significant part of our business, which allows us to use our capital to buy in bulk with quick resale opportunities, whether it be direct Amazon listings or through partnerships with the likes of Walmart, BJ’s, Costco, Sam’s Club, etc. We are able to expand our network, build new relationships, and sell branded products without added cost of advertising. 

8

Retail Partnerships. While eCommerce is our direct line of business, we have grown and continue to expand our relationships with big box retailers in order to sell branded products as resellers or to place our in-house brands in those stores. With longstanding accounts that we’ve taken ownership of through acquisitions, we have grown our network and have untapped additional revenue streams. 
Professionalism and Entrepreneurial Culture. Our professionalism and entrepreneurial culture foster highly dedicated employees who provide our customers with unsurpassed customer service. We continue to invest in our talent by providing every employee with an extensive and ongoing education and have successfully developed programs that provide comprehensive product knowledge and the tools needed to have a unique understanding of our customers’ personalities and decision-making processes.
Experienced and Proven Management Team Driving Growth through Organic and Accretive Acquisition Opportunities. We believe our management team has extensive experience in the industry. Our senior management team brings experience in accounting, mergers and acquisitions, financial services, consumer packaged goods, retail operations and third-party logistics.
Our Growth Strategy

Our growth will focus on the expansion of our brand portfolio through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. 

Direct-to-Consumer Expansion. Our direct-to-consumer business is expected to be our growth driver for the next several years, driven by acquisitions of profitable Amazon and eCommerce businesses. This allows us to tap into multiple markets and helps us acquire proven brands that are at a stage in their lifecycle when they lack the resources (capital and personnel) to grow rapidly on their own. Our model helps inject those resources into the business in hopes to scale the business efficiently. 

Resellers & liquidators. While direct-to-consumer brands represent a major part of our growth, our company has realized the potential of acquiring profitable resellers who sell on/to Amazon, Walmart, Costco, BJ’s, Sam’s Club, and more. Our first acquisition in the space, Cygnet Online, sells branded OTC products on Amazon. A letter of intent was signed on August 2, 2022 for the acquisition of E-Core, Inc. and its subsidiaries to further expand this segment of our business. We believe this is a lucrative industry that also helps establish strong, big box retail partnerships. 

Talent acquisition. A large part of our acquisition process is to not only evaluate the brand/product offerings, but to understand the team that has been responsible for its success. In a tough market for hiring, this has proven to be a strategic method for bringing on talent. We not only get a great brand, but look to retain the personnel, often the heartbeat of said brand, give them resources, and even utilize them for other brands that we have launched internally or acquired. We strongly believe that continued success relies on a growing team of experts across various industries.

Advertising technology. With online sales increasing, so has the cost of advertising. Our in-house, programmatic advertising technology, Interactive Offers, not only acts as a revenue stream for our business, but provides us with endless research, consumer data, and allows us to achieve lower advertising costs for our brands. The business has a growing list of publishers and advertisers who also utilize our technology to monetize their data, achieve better CPMs, and even increase their average order values. 

International expansion. Our primary focus has been on the US eCommerce market which, as mentioned, is forecasted to grow stronger than others. However, with recently acquired brands and their presence in international markets, we expect nearly all of our products to be offered worldwide over the next few years.

Acquiring Aggregators. The aggregation craze took off in 2019 to 2020, but many found themselves overpaying for brands and not being able to support the growth they had forecasted. Recently, these aggregators have been looking for funding and/or selling their assets. We seek to take advantage of this opportunity to bring on additional brands and talent that, for better or worse, were overwhelmed and unprepared. 

9

Competition

There is heavy competition in the aggregation market, but each company seems to be trying to carve their own niche in the space. We compete against several national and international companies, most of which have substantially greater resources than we do. Our principal competitors consist of large, well-known and funded, private companies. Our goal is never to compete against these aggregators, but to do our own research, focus on profitability, and grow efficiently, rather than overextend ourselves and pay up for valuations that don’t make sense.
Government Regulation

We are subject to laws and regulations affecting our operations in a number of areas. These laws and regulations affect the Company’s activities in areas, including, but not limited to, the hemp business in the United States, the consumer products and nutritional supplement markets in the United States, consumer protection, labor, intellectual property ownership and infringement, import and export requirements, federal and state healthcare, environmental and safety. The successful execution of our business objectives will be contingent upon our compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals, permits and registrations, which may be onerous and expensive. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in such applicable laws and regulations and the expansion of the Company’s business, could make our products less attractive to our customers, delay the introduction of new products, and require the Company to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

We operate our business in markets that are both highly regulated and rapidly evolving. We are subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations affecting the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and sale of food, beverages, dietary supplements, and personal care products/cosmetics, as well as the use of hemp and hemp-derived ingredients like CBD in such products. The FDA regulates hemp and hemp-derived ingredients in FDA-regulated products pursuant to the provisions of the FDCA and regulations promulgated pursuant to it, in particular those related to adulteration and labeling of cosmetic, food, and dietary supplements. The FDA has issued guidance on the subject and issued letters to companies regarding claims made for products and the use of such ingredients in various products. The FDA also initiated a task force to evaluate pathways for further regulation of hemp and hemp-derived ingredients. At various times, bills pertaining to the regulation of hemp and hemp-derived ingredients have been introduced in both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, and additional proposed legislation is expected to be introduced in the future to clarify the regulatory status of cannabinoids from hemp generally and CBD generally. Future legislation approved by Congress and signed by the President, or rulemaking promulgated by the FDA, could either positively or adversely impact the future sale of products by the Company.

We are currently not subject to any foreign regulations as we do not currently distribute or export any products, including hemp or CBD related products outside the U.S. Additionally, we are not aware of any foreign regulations that we had to comply with in regard to the sale of our flavoring products to one end user customer in the U.S. who distributed such products to Europe where it had operations. The responsibility for compliance with any European regulations would be on such customer. 

Additionally, numerous states have passed forms of hemp legislation governing the cultivation of hemp, as well as the further processing and sale of hemp and products with hemp or hemp-derived ingredients. Those states that have not yet enacted laws or issued regulations pertaining to hemp and hemp-derived ingredients may do so in the near future. Unless Congress specifically enacts laws preempting the state regulations of hemp products, we will continue to be subject not only to federal law but various state laws. Presently, Upexi and only distributes hemp-products in states that it is legal to do so. Changes in the state laws and regulations could again either positively or adversely affect our ability to sell products in those states.

Employees

The Company has 130 full-time employees working out of its headquarters in Clearwater Florida, its Henderson, Nevada, manufacturing facility, its offices and distribution warehouses in Southern, Florida and Los Angeles California or individuals’ home-based offices.
