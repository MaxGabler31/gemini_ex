Item 1. Business
​
General
​
Papa John’s International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to as the “Company”, “Papa John’s” or in the first person notations of “we”, “us” and “our”), operates and franchises pizza delivery and carryout restaurants and, in certain international markets, dine-in and delivery restaurants under the trademark “Papa John’s”. Papa John’s began operations in 1984. At December 26, 2021, there were 5,650 Papa John’s restaurants in operation, consisting of 600 Company-owned and 5,050 franchised restaurants operating in 50 countries and territories. Our Company-owned restaurants include 188 restaurants operated under four joint venture arrangements. All of the 2,311 international restaurants are franchised. 
​
Strategy
​
We are committed to delivering on our brand promise “BETTER INGREDIENTS. BETTER PIZZA.®” and a business strategy designed to drive sustainable long-term, profitable growth. 
​
We believe that using high quality ingredients leads to superior quality pizzas. Our original crust pizza dough is made from six simple ingredients and is fresh, never frozen. We also top our pizzas with real cheese made from mozzarella, pizza sauce made with vine-ripened tomatoes, and meat free of fillers. Our marketing and menu strategies emphasize the quality of our ingredients and our new product innovations to accelerate sales. One of our most recent menu innovations, the new Epic Stuffed Crust pizza, was officially launched in the first quarter of 2021 and has been one of our most successful launches to date. The Epic Stuffed Crust pizza, and other menu innovations like our recently announced New York Style pizza, along with Garlic Parmesan Crust, toasted handheld “Papadias” flatbread-style sandwiches and Jalapeno Popper Rolls launched in 2020, demonstrates our commitment to building new long-term sustainable menu products on which we can continue to innovate. These products form the foundation of our growing comparable sales and improving unit economics. 
​
We utilize technology to deliver a better customer experience, improve operational efficiencies and inform our decision-making. Our loyalty program (“Papa Rewards”) and one-to-one marketing platforms help us retain loyal customers and attract new ones. As our loyalty program grows, it continues to deliver strategic benefits. Papa Rewards customers are significantly more profitable than non-loyalty customers since we are able to directly engage them with targeted personalized offers that drive higher frequency, ticket price and satisfaction. We also partner with top domestic delivery aggregators to meet customer demand for our products. Aggregators have also helped navigate the labor shortage that the Company is experiencing by providing supplemental delivery drivers, especially during peak times when our delivery teams are working at full capacity. 
​
We continue to pursue a growth strategy by expanding our footprint, both domestically and internationally. In August 2021, we announced our expanded partnership with Drake Food Service International to open over 220 restaurants across Latin America, Spain, Portugal and the United Kingdom (“UK”) by 2025. In September 2021, we announced the Company's largest domestic development deal ever with Sun Holdings, who will open 100 new locations in high-growth markets in Texas and the South by 2029. Most recently, in January 2022, we announced a partnership with FountainVest Partners, one of Asia’s leading independent private equity firms, to open more than 1,350 new stores across South China by 2040, the largest franchisee development agreement in our history.
​
A large majority of Papa John’s restaurants are franchised. We believe a franchised model provides resiliency of earnings and presents us with an opportunity to enhance growth with less capital investment than a traditional company-operated restaurant model. We seek to attract and retain franchisees with experience in restaurant or retail operations and with the financial resources and management capabilities to open single or multiple locations. While each Papa John’s franchisee manages and operates its own restaurants and business, we devote significant resources to providing franchisees with assistance in restaurant operations, quality assurance, technology, training, marketing, site selection and restaurant design. Papa John’s franchise owners benefit from our award-winning brand, food service capabilities and the Papa John’s digital and delivery model. 




Segment Overview
​
Papa John’s has four defined reportable segments: Domestic Company-owned restaurants, North America commissaries (Quality Control Centers), North America franchising and International operations.
​
Domestic Company-owned Restaurants 
​
The Domestic Company-owned restaurant segment consists of the operations of all domestic Company-owned restaurants (“domestic” is defined as the contiguous United States) and derives its revenues principally from retail sales of pizza, Papadias, and side items, including breadsticks, cheesesticks, chicken poppers and wings, dessert items and canned or bottled beverages. 
​
Of the total 3,339 North American restaurants open as of December 26, 2021, 600 units, or approximately 18%, were Company-owned. In 2021, the 579 domestic Company-owned restaurants included in the full year’s comparable restaurant base generated average annual unit sales of $1.3 million. We are committed to maintaining sound restaurant unit economics. 
​
Operating Company-owned restaurants allows us to improve operations, training, marketing and quality standards for the benefit of the entire Papa John’s system.
​
North America commissary
​
The North America commissary segment comprises 11 full-service regional dough production and distribution Quality Control Centers (“QC Centers”) in the United States (“U.S.”), which supply pizza sauce, dough, food products, paper products, smallwares and cleaning supplies twice weekly to each traditional restaurant served. This system enables us to monitor and control product quality and consistency while lowering food and other costs. We also have one QC Center in Canada, which produces and distributes fresh dough. We evaluate the QC Center system capacity in relation to existing restaurants’ volumes and planned restaurant growth, and facilities are developed or upgraded as operational or economic conditions warrant. To ensure consistent food quality, each domestic franchisee is required to purchase dough and pizza sauce from our QC Centers and to purchase all other supplies from our QC Centers or other approved suppliers.
​
North America franchising 
​
The North America franchising segment consists of our franchise sales and support activities and derives its revenues from the sale of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our franchisees located in the United States and Canada. Our North American franchised restaurants, which included 2,384 restaurants in the full year’s comparable base for 2021, generated average annual unit sales of $1.1 million. These sales, while not included in the Company’s revenues, contribute to our royalty revenues, franchisee marketing fund contributions, and commissary revenue. 
​
International 
​
The International segment principally consists of distribution sales to franchised Papa John’s restaurants located in the UK and our franchise sales and support activities, which derive revenues from sales of franchise and development rights and the collection of royalties from our international franchisees. International franchisees are defined as all franchise operations outside of the United States and Canada. As of December 26, 2021, there were 2,311 international restaurants, all of which are franchised. The Company currently operates one international QC Center, which is in the UK. Other QC Centers outside the U.S. are operated by franchisees pursuant to license agreements or by other third parties. 
​
All others
​
All other business units that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments, which are not operating segments, we refer to as “all others”. These consist of operations that derive revenues from franchise contributions to our marketing funds and the sale, principally to Company-owned and franchised restaurants, of 




information systems and related services used in restaurant operations, including our point-of-sale system, online and other technology-based ordering platforms, and printing and promotional items.
​
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Note 22” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for financial information about our segments.
​
Development
​
At December 26, 2021, there were 5,650 Papa John’s restaurants operating in 50 countries and territories, as follows:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
------------------------------+------------------------+---+--------------------------+---+---------------------+---+---------------+---+------------
​ | Domestic Company-owned | ​ | Franchised North America | ​ | Total North America | ​ | International | ​ | System-wide
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
Beginning - December 27, 2020 | 588 | ​ | 2,701 | ​ | 3,289 | ​ | 2,111 | ​ | 5,400 
Opened | 11 | ​ | 74 | ​ | 85 | ​ | 304 | ​ | 389 
Closed | - | ​ | (35) | ​ | (35) | ​ | (104) | ​ | (139) 
Acquired | 1 | ​ | - | ​ | 1 | ​ | - | ​ | 1 
Sold | - | ​ | (1) | ​ | (1) | ​ | - | ​ | (1) 
Ending - December 26, 2021 | 600 | ​ | 2,739 | ​ | 3,339 | ​ | 2,311 | ​ | 5,650 
Net unit growth | 12 | ​ | 38 | ​ | 50 | ​ | 200 | ​ | 250 

​
Although most of our domestic Company-owned markets are well-penetrated, our Company-owned restaurant growth strategy is to continue to open domestic restaurants in existing markets as appropriate, thereby increasing consumer awareness and enabling us to take advantage of operational and marketing scale efficiencies. Our experience in developing markets indicates that market penetration through the opening of multiple restaurants in a particular market results in increased average restaurant sales in that market over time. We have co-developed domestic markets with some franchisees or divided markets among franchisees and will continue to use market co-development in the future, where appropriate.
​
Franchise Program
​
We continue to attract qualified and experienced franchisees, whom we consider to be a vital part of our system’s continued growth. We believe our relationship with our franchisees is fundamental to the performance of our brand and we strive to maintain a collaborative relationship with our franchisees. Franchisees are approved on the basis of the applicant’s business background, restaurant operating experience and financial resources. 
​
North America Development and Franchise Agreements.  We enter into development agreements with our franchisees in North America for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified geographic area. The franchise agreement is generally executed once a franchisee secures a location. Our current standard franchise agreement requires the franchisee to pay a royalty fee of 5% of sales, and the majority of our existing franchised restaurants have a 5% contractual royalty rate in effect. Incentives offered from time to time, including new store incentives, will reduce the contractual royalty rate paid. We provided financial assistance for traditional North America franchisees in 2020 and 2019 in the form of lower royalties, royalty-based service incentives, and targeted relief as well as additional contributions to Papa John’s Marketing Fund (“PJMF”). This temporary franchisee assistance program concluded in the third quarter of 2020.
​
Over the past several years, we have offered various development incentive programs for domestic franchisees to accelerate unit openings. Such incentives included the following for 2021 traditional openings: (1) waiver of all or part of the standard one-time franchise fee; (2) waiver of all or part of the 5% royalty fee for a period of time; (3) credit for new store equipment; and (4) credit to be applied toward a future food purchase, under certain circumstances. We believe development incentive programs have accelerated unit openings, and we expect to continue to utilize such development incentives.
​



Substantially all existing franchise agreements have an initial 10-year term with a 10-year renewal option. We have the right to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons, including a franchisee’s failure to make payments when due or failure to adhere to our operational policies and standards. Many state franchise laws limit our ability as a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise.
​
International Development and Franchise Agreements.  In international markets, we have either a development agreement or a master franchise agreement with a franchisee for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified geographic area. Under a master franchise agreement, the franchisee has the right to sub-franchise a portion of the development to one or more sub-franchisees approved by us. 
​
Our current standard international master franchise and development agreements provide for payment to us of a royalty fee of 5% of sales. For international markets with sub-franchise agreements, the effective sub-franchise royalty received by the Company is generally 3% of sales and the master franchisee generally receives a royalty of 2% of sales. The remaining terms applicable to the operation of individual restaurants are substantially equivalent to the terms of our domestic franchise agreement. Development agreements will be negotiated at other-than-standard terms for fees and royalties, and we may offer various development and royalty incentives to help drive unit growth and results.
​
Franchise Operations. All franchisees are required to operate their Papa John’s restaurants in compliance with our policies, standards and specifications, including matters such as menu items, ingredients, and restaurant design. Franchisees have full discretion in human resource practices, and generally have full discretion to determine the prices to be charged to customers, but we generally have the authority to set maximum price points for nationally advertised promotions.
​
Franchisee Loans. Selected domestic and international franchisees have borrowed funds from us, principally for the purchase of restaurants from us or other franchisees or, in certain international markets, for construction and development of new restaurants. Loans made to franchisees can bear interest at fixed or floating rates and in most cases are secured by the fixtures, equipment and signage of the restaurant and/or are guaranteed by the franchise owners. At December 26, 2021, net loans outstanding totaled $47.9 million. See “Note 2” of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information.
​
Marketing Programs
​
Our domestic marketing strategy consists of both national and local components. Our national strategy includes national advertising via television, print, direct mail, digital, mobile marketing and social media channels. Our digital marketing activities have increased significantly over the past several years in response to increasing customer use of online and mobile technology. Local advertising programs include television, radio, print, direct mail, store-to-door flyers, digital, mobile marketing and local social media channels. 
​
Domestic Company-owned and franchised Papa John’s restaurants within a defined market may be required to join an area advertising cooperative (“Co-op”). Each member restaurant contributes a percentage of sales to the Co-op for market-wide programs, such as television, radio, digital and print advertising, and sports sponsorships. The rate of contribution and uses of the monies collected are determined by a majority vote of the Co-op’s members. 
​
The restaurant-level and Co-op marketing efforts are supported by media, print, digital and electronic advertising materials that are produced by PJMF, our national marketing fund. PJMF is a consolidated nonstock corporation, designed to operate at break-even for the purpose of designing and administering advertising and promotional programs for all participating domestic restaurants. PJMF produces and buys air time for Papa John’s national television commercials and advertises the Company’s products through digital media including banner advertising, paid search-engine advertising, mobile marketing, social media advertising and marketing, text messaging, and email. PJMF also engages in other brand-building activities, such as consumer research and public relations activities. Domestic Company-owned and franchised Papa John’s restaurants are required to contribute a certain minimum percentage of sales to PJMF. 
​
In international markets, our marketing focuses on reaching customers who live or work within a small radius of a Papa John’s restaurant. Our international markets use a combination of advertising strategies, including television, radio, print, digital, mobile marketing and local social media depending on the size of the local market.




Human Capital
​
Our team members are critical to our success. As of December 26, 2021, we employed approximately 14,000 persons, of whom approximately 11,500 were team members at Company-owned restaurants, approximately 700 were management personnel at Company-owned restaurants, approximately 700 were corporate personnel and approximately 1,100 were QC Center and our print and promotions subsidiary personnel. Our team members are non-unionized, and most restaurant team members work part-time and are paid on an hourly basis. 
​
Our franchisees are independent business owners, so their employees are not our employees and therefore are not included in our employee count. We estimate the total number of persons in the Papa John’s system, including our team members, franchisees and the team members of franchisees, was approximately 115,000 as of December 26, 2021.
​
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
​
Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is rooted in our belief that having a Papa John's family that fully reflects and celebrates the global nature of our brand is the right way to do business. After being recognized by Forbes in 2021 as one of America's Best Employers for Diversity, Papa John's joined Forbes' annual list of the World's Best employers. We were honored to rank #1 amongst all pizza companies and #2 in the entire restaurant category. Also, for the second year in a row, we received a score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2022 Corporate Equality Index.
​
Creating an inclusive and diverse culture that supports and values team members is important to attracting and retaining talented, dedicated employees. We’re implementing initiatives to diversify our workforce and leadership pipeline, embed policies and practices that ensure fairness and instill and reward behaviors across the organization that foster belonging and increase employee engagement. Out of the 19 members of our Senior Leadership Team and Board of Directors, nine are female, three are Black, and one is Hispanic. We have also initiated multiple corporate initiatives over the past several years, including required unconscious bias training for team members, annual Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion training for all team members, the launch of The Papa John’s Foundation for Building Community, our Day of Service with Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and the creation of eight employee resource affinity groups. 
​
Talent Attraction, Retention and Development
​
Our ability to attract and retain hourly employees in our restaurants has become more challenging, especially as the job market has become more competitive and COVID-19 related factors, especially the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, have prevented employees from being able to work due to illness or quarantine. While we expect the impact of Omicron to subside, we expect labor and inflationary cost challenges to be a continued priority focus for us in 2022. We continue to aspire to be the employer of choice in our industry, including through commitment to diversity and inclusion, and our investments in our team members. In 2021, we announced new hiring, referral and appreciation bonuses. We also made permanent the expanded health, wellness, paid time off and college tuition benefits that we rolled out during the pandemic, including free virtual healthcare visits for all part-time and full-time team members. We intend to continue making these kinds of investments to ensure we support our team members as they support our customers. 
​
To help our team members succeed in their roles and to ensure consistent operational execution, we emphasize continuous training and development opportunities, including providing innovative tools and materials for the operational training and development of team members. Operations personnel complete our management training program and ongoing development programs, including multi-unit training, in which instruction is given on all aspects of our systems and operations. In addition, to further support our team members’ development, we have established our Dough & Degrees program, which allows our team members to earn a college degree for free or at a reduced tuition in partnership with Purdue University Global and the University of Maryland Global Campus. We also offer a tuition reimbursement program that provides another opportunity for our team members to advance their careers. 
​
Workplace Health and Safety
​
As part of the Company’s enterprise-wide safety management system, we invest in training, technology and people to protect both our customers and team members. All Papa John’s team members, from those at our corporate offices to 




those working in our warehouses and restaurants, receive annual safety training based on the requirements of their roles. Our QC Centers and restaurant operations undergo annual safety audits, as well as random safety checks by regional safety managers and field safety coordinators. 
​
We have also taken steps to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our team members and our customers by implementing extra health and safety measures across our business, including No Contact Delivery and enhanced cleaning and sanitization measures. 
​
Industry and Competition
​
The United States Quick Service Restaurant pizza (“QSR Pizza”) industry is mature and highly competitive with respect to price, service, location, food quality, customer loyalty programs and product innovation. The QSR Pizza category is largely fragmented, and competitors include a few large national chains and many smaller regional chains, as well as a large number of local independent pizza operators, any of which can utilize a growing number of food delivery services. Some of our competitors have been in existence for substantially longer periods than Papa John’s, have substantially greater resources than Papa John’s and can have higher levels of restaurant penetration and stronger, more developed brand awareness in markets where we compete. Competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery concepts also continues to increase.
​
Internationally, the pizza delivery model is not as mature as the domestic market and presents a growth opportunity for Papa John’s. We believe demand from international consumers will continue to increase as the demand for pizza delivery and carryout continues. We continue to execute on our growth strategy and expand throughout the world. 
​
With respect to the sale of franchises, we compete with many franchisors of restaurants and other business concepts. There is also active competition for management personnel, drivers and hourly team members, and attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for Papa John’s restaurants.
​
Government Regulation
​
We, along with our franchisees, are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting the operation of our respective businesses, including laws and regulations related to our marketing and advertising as well as the preparation and sale of food, food safety and menu labeling. Each Papa John’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation, building and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant in a particular area. Our QC Centers are licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes, and the operation of our trucks is subject to federal and state transportation regulations. We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations. In addition, our domestic operations are subject to various federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, benefits, taxation, working conditions, citizenship requirements, and overtime.
​
We are subject to Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulation and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The laws of several states also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document containing prescribed information. State laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a significant number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the U.S. franchisor-franchisee relationship in certain respects if such bills were enacted. State laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship. National, state and local government regulations or initiatives, including health care legislation, “living wage,” or other current or proposed regulations, and increases in minimum wage rates affect Papa John’s as well as others within the restaurant industry. We are also subject to applicable laws in each non-U.S. jurisdiction in which we operate.
​



Privacy and Data Protection
​
We are subject to privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally. The legal and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increase in attention given to privacy and data protection issues with the potential to impact our business. This includes recently enacted laws and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries which require notification to individuals and government authorities of breaches involving certain categories of personal information. Any changes in privacy and data protection laws or regulations could also adversely impact the way we use e-mail, text messages and other marketing techniques and could require changes in our marketing strategies. We have a privacy policy posted on our website at www.papajohns.com. The security of our financial data, customer information and other personal information is a priority for us.
​
Trademarks, Copyrights and Domain Names
​
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, foreign intellectual property laws, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. From time to time, we are made aware of the use by other persons in certain geographical areas of names and marks that are the same as or substantially similar to our marks. It is our policy to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to vigorously oppose any infringement of our marks.
​
We hold copyrights in authored works used in our business, including advertisements, packaging, training, website, and promotional materials. In addition, we have registered and maintain Internet domain names, including “papajohns.com,” and country code domains patterned as papajohns.cc, or a close variation thereof, with “.cc” representing a specific country code.
​
Environmental Matters
​
We are not aware of any federal, state, local or international environmental laws or regulations that we expect to materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures. However, we cannot predict the effect of possible future environment legislation or regulations on our operations. During 2021, we had no material environmental compliance-related capital expenditures, and no such material expenditures are anticipated in 2022.
​
Impact of COVID-19
​
Please refer to “Recent Business Matters” within “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of recent business developments, including the impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on our business and results of operations and financial condition.
