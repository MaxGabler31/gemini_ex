ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 Proofpoint is a leading next-generation cybersecurity company that enables large and mid-sized organizations worldwide to protect the way their people work from advanced threats and compliance risks. Our integrated suite of products works together to help organizations build people-centric security and compliance programs. We provide threat protection, information protection, user protection, business ecosystem protection, and compliance solutions to address today’s rapidly changing threat and compliance landscape. Our solutions are built on a flexible, cloud-based platform and leverage proprietary technologies - including big data analytics, machine learning, deep content inspection, secure storage, advanced encryption, intelligent message routing, dynamic malware analysis, threat correlation, and virtual execution environments.
 Every company’s greatest asset and greatest security risk is its people. Cyberattacks have fundamentally shifted from targeting infrastructure to targeting people, relying on tricking users into running code, divulging their passwords, or even sending money or data. This transformation of the threat landscape manifests in nearly every form of cyber threat, from nation state advanced persistent threat (APT) actors relying on phishing, through to cybercriminals launching massive ransomware email campaigns, and more targeted campaigns designed to steal valuable data from both legacy and cloud-based systems. At the same time, the rapid adoption of cloud applications has increased organizations’ attack surface by moving both threats and sensitive data away from the traditional network perimeter, reducing the effectiveness of many existing security products. These factors have contributed to an increasing number of severe data breaches and expanding regulatory mandates, notably the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), all of which have accelerated demand for effective threat protection and compliance solutions.
 Our platform addresses this growing challenge by not only protecting data as it flows into and out of the enterprise via on-premises and cloud-based email, social media, and other cloud applications, but also by keeping track of this information as it is modified and distributed throughout the enterprise for compliance and data loss prevention, and securely archiving these communications for compliance and discovery. We help organizations reduce their critical risk in five major ways:
  
• | Protecting users from the advanced attacks that target them via email, web, networks, social media, and cloud apps;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing the theft or inadvertent loss of sensitive information and, in turn, ensuring compliance with regulatory data protection mandates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improving the resilience of end-users to the threats that target them and training them to be better caretakers of their organizations’ critical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Collecting, retaining, supervising and discovering communications and sensitive data for compliance and litigation support; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enabling organizations to respond quickly to security issues, providing both the intelligence and the context to prioritize incidents and orchestrate remediation actions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our platform and its associated solutions are sold to customers on a subscription basis and can be deployed through our unique cloud-based architecture that leverages both our global data centers as well as optional points-of-presence behind our customers’ firewalls. Our flexible deployment model enables us to deliver superior security and compliance while maintaining the favorable economics afforded by cloud computing, creating a competitive advantage for us over legacy on-premises and cloud-only offerings.
 We were founded in 2002 to provide a unified solution to help enterprises address their growing data security requirements. Our first solution was commercially released in 2003 to combat the burgeoning problem of spam and viruses and their impact on corporate email systems. To address the evolving threat landscape and the adoption of communication and collaboration systems beyond corporate email and networks, we have broadened our solutions to defend against a wide range of threats, including email, mobile apps and social media, to protect the

information people create from both compromise and compliance risks, and to archive and govern corporate information. Today, our solutions are used worldwide to protect well over 100 million end-users at enterprise customers, and millions more via service providers through our Cloudmark division. We market and sell our solutions worldwide both directly through our sales teams and indirectly through a hybrid model where our sales organization actively assists our network of distributors and resellers. We also distribute our solutions through strategic partners.
 Proofpoint Solutions
 Our integrated suite of on-demand security-as-a-service solutions enables large and mid-sized organizations to protect people throughout the enterprise from advanced attacks and compliance risks. Our comprehensive platform provides a secure email gateway, advanced threat protection, security awareness training, threat intelligence, email authentication, email encryption, data loss prevention, digital risk protection, cloud application protection, web browser isolation, archiving, e-discovery, and threat response capabilities. These solutions are built on a cloud-based architecture, protecting enterprises and their customers from inbound threats via email, social media, and mobile apps, while identifying and protecting enterprise data not only where it is stored within the enterprise but also as it transits beyond the organization’s borders such as via email or social media. We have pioneered the use of innovative technologies to deliver better ease-of-use, greater protection against the latest advanced threats, and lower total cost of ownership than traditional alternatives. The key elements of our solution include:

• | Superior protection against both advanced and targeted threats. We use a combination of proprietary technologies for big data analytics, machine learning, deep content inspection, static and dynamic malware analysis, protocol analysis, threat correlation, threat intelligence extraction, and virtual execution environments to predictively and actively detect and stop targeted “spear phishing” and other sophisticated advanced threats, including malicious attachments, polymorphic threats, zero-day exploits, user-transparent “drive-by” downloads, malicious web links, hybrid threats (such as links inserted into attached files), malware free attacks like impostor threats and credential phishing, and other penetration tactics. By processing, analyzing and correlating billions of data points on a daily basis, we can recognize anomalies in order to predictively detect targeted attacks before users are exposed. Our deep content inspection technology enables us to identify malicious message attachments and distinguish between valid messages and “phishing” messages designed to look authentic and trick the end-user into divulging sensitive data or clicking on a malicious web link. Our machine learning technology enables us to detect targeted “zero-hour” attacks in real-time, even if they have not been seen previously at other locations, and quarantine them appropriately. Our dynamic malware analysis and virtual execution environment technologies enable us to examine web site destinations and downloadable files to identify and block potentially hostile code that would otherwise compromise end-user computers, even in cases where the web sites are considered reputable or the attachment’s malicious payload is obfuscated or otherwise disguised. Our threat correlation technologies enable us to rapidly confirm and contain threats, providing rapid, automated protection. In addition, our threat intelligence and response capabilities enable our customers to both prioritize threats that may have compromised them and orchestrate or automate protective countermeasures.

• | Big data analytics. Indexes and analyzes petabytes of information in real-time to discover threats, detect data leaks and enable end-users to quickly and efficiently access information distributed across their organizations. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Machine learning. Builds predictive data models using our proprietary Proofpoint MLX machine learning techniques to rapidly identify and classify threats and sensitive content in real-time. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Identity and policy. Enables the definition and enforcement of sophisticated data protection policies based on a wide set of variables, including type of content, sender, recipient, pending legal matters, time and date, regulatory status and more. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Secure storage. Stores petabytes of data in the cloud cost-effectively using proprietary encryption methods, keeping sensitive data tamper-proof and private, yet fully searchable in real-time. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Virtual execution environments. Exposes suspected malware to a permuted set of instrumented virtual system environments, to assess maliciousness, exploit activity and compromise processes. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Intelligent message routing. Policies can be established by administrators to automatically direct email communications differently through the email network, based on aspects of the messages, for security, compliance, supervisory, system performance, or other reasons. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Threat intelligence correlation. Utilizes inputs from Proofpoint, cloud, and other third-party products to assess IoCs and confirm successful system compromises by malicious actors in near-real-time, then administers network controls to effectively contain the compromised systems. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Infrastructure
 We deliver our security-as-a-service solutions through our cloud architecture and international data center infrastructure. We operate thousands of physical and virtual servers across seventeen data centers located in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, France, Germany, and Australia.
 Our cloud architecture is optimized to meet the unique demands of delivering real-time security-as-a-service to global enterprises. Key design elements include:
  
• | Security. Security is central to our cloud architecture and is designed into all levels of the system, including physical security, network security, application security, and security at our third-party data centers. Our security measures have met the rigorous standards of SSAE 16 certification. In addition to this commercial certification program, we have also successfully completed the FISMA certification for our cloud-based information protection and archiving solution, enabling us to serve the rigorous security requirements of U.S. federal agencies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalability and performance. By leveraging a distributed, scalable architecture we process billions of requests against our reputation systems and hundreds of millions of messages per day, all in near real-time. Massively-parallel query processing technology is designed to ensure rapid search results over this vast data volume. In addition to this aggregate scalability across all customers, our architecture also scales to effectively meet the needs of several of our largest individual customers, each of which has millions of users and processes tens of millions of messages per day. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hybrid Deployment. Our cloud architecture enables individual customers to deploy entirely in Proofpoint’s global data centers or in hybrid configurations with optional points of presence located behind the customer’s firewall. This deployment flexibility enables us to deliver security, compliance and performance tailored to the unique threat profile and operating environment of each customer. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers
 As of December 31, 2018, we had customers of all sizes across a wide variety of industries. A number of our largest customers use our platform to protect more than a million users and handle over a billion messages per day. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, one partner accounted for 12% of total revenue, although the partner sold to a number of end-users, none of which accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2018 and 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. In each year since the launch of our first solution in 2003, we have maintained a renewal rate with our existing customers of over 90%.
 We target large and mid-sized organizations across all major verticals including aerospace and defense, education, financial services, government, healthcare, manufacturing and retail. We have been particularly successful selling to the largest enterprises in the United States as ranked by Fortune Magazine. We have also had success penetrating the market leaders in a number of significant verticals including:
  
• | 3 of the 5 largest U.S. retailers
--+----------------------------------


• | 4 of the 5 largest U.S. aerospace and defense contractors
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | 5 of the 5 largest U.S. banks
--+------------------------------


• | 4 of the 5 largest global pharmaceutical companies
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | 4 of the 5 largest U.S. petroleum refining companies
--+-----------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing
 Sales
 We primarily target large and mid-sized organizations across all industries. Our sales and marketing programs are organized by geographic regions, including Asia-Pacific, EMEA, Japan, North America, and South America, and we further segment and organize our sales force into teams that focus on large enterprises (4,000 employees and above), mid-sized organizations (1,000 - 4,000 employees) and existing customers. In addition, we create integrated sales and marketing programs targeting specific vertical-markets. This vertical-market approach enables us to provide a higher level of service and understanding of our customers’ unique needs, including the industry-specific business and regulatory requirements in industries such as healthcare, financial services, retail and education.
 We sell through both direct and indirect channels, including technology and channel partners:
  
• | Direct sales and reseller channel. We market and sell our solutions to large and mid-sized customers directly through our field and inside sales teams as well as indirectly through a hybrid model, where our sales organization actively assists our network of distributors and resellers. Our sales personnel are primarily located in North America, with additional personnel located in Asia-Pacific, EMEA, Japan and South America. Our reseller partners maintain relationships with their customers throughout the territories in which they operate, providing them with services and third-party solutions to help meet their evolving security requirements. As such, these partners act as a direct conduit through which we can connect with these prospective customers to offer our solutions. Our channel partners include security centric resellers such as CDW, Optiv, and AT&T, as well as distributors such as Ingram Micro and Exclusive Networks. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strategic relationships. We also sell our solutions indirectly through key technology companies that offer our solutions in conjunction with one or more of their own products or services. These companies each have their own base of customers, and they distribute our products to augment their own branded products and solutions, sometimes under their own brand and sometimes under the Proofpoint brand. In addition, our Cloudmark division delivers email protection to many of the largest global internet service providers.

For sales involving a partner such as a distributor, reseller or strategic partner, the partner engages with the prospective customer directly and involves our sales team as needed to assist in developing and closing an order. At the conclusion of a successful sales cycle, we sell the associated subscription, hardware and services to the partner who in turn resells these items to the customer, with the partner earning a margin based on the amount paid to Proofpoint as compared to the amount charged to the customer. With the order completed, we provide these customers with direct access to our security-as-a-service platform and other associated services, enabling us to establish a direct relationship and provide them with support as part of ensuring that the customer has a good experience with our platform. At the end of the contract term, the partner engages with the customer to execute a renewal order, with our team providing assistance as required.
 Marketing
 We have a number of marketing initiatives to build awareness about our solutions and encourage customer adoption of our solutions. Our marketing programs include a variety of digital marketing, advertising, conferences, events, white-papers, public relations activities and web-based seminar campaigns targeted at key decision makers within our prospective customers.
 We offer free trials, competitive evaluations, and free security and compliance risk assessments to allow prospective customers to experience the quality of our solutions, to learn in detail about the features and functionality of our suite, and to quantify the potential benefits of our solutions.
 Customer Service and Support
 We believe that our customer service and support provide a competitive advantage and are critical to retaining and expanding our customer base. We conduct regular third-party surveys to measure customer loyalty and satisfaction with our solutions.
Proofpoint Support Services
 We deliver 24x7x365 customer support from support centers located in EMEA, North America and Asia-Pacific regions. We offer a wide range of support offerings with varying levels of access to our support resources.
Proofpoint Professional Services and Training
 With our security-as-a-service model, our solutions are designed to be implemented, configured, and operated without the need for any training or professional services. For those customers that would like to develop deeper expertise in the use of our solutions or would like some assistance with complex configurations or the importing of data, we offer various training and professional services. Many implementation services can be completed in one day and are primarily provided remotely using web-based conferencing tools. If requested, our professional services organization also provides additional assistance with data importing, design, implementation, customization, or advanced reporting. We also offer a learning center for both in-person and online training and certification.
Research and Development
 We devote significant resources to improve and enhance our existing security solutions and maintain the effectiveness of our platform, monitoring the threat landscape in real-time and making constant adjustments to remain effective as the threat landscape shifts. We also work closely with our customers to gain valuable insights into their threat environments and security management practices to assist us in designing new solutions and features that extend the data protection, archiving and governance capabilities of our platform. Our technical staff monitors and tests our software on a regular basis, and we maintain a regular release process to update and enhance our existing solutions. Leveraging our on-demand platform model, we can deploy real-time upgrades with no downtime.
Competition
 Our markets are highly competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid changes in technology. We compete primarily with companies that offer a broad array of data protection and governance solutions. Providers of data protection solutions generally have product offerings that include threat protection, virus protection, data loss prevention, flexible remediation, data encryption, and in some cases secure file transfer. Providers of archiving solutions generally have product offerings that provide data storage, search, policy enforcement, legal-hold management, and in some cases supervision.

Key competitors include:
  
• | Email and Advanced Threat Protection: Cisco Systems, Inc. (through its acquisitions of IronPort, SourceFire, and ThreatGRID), Microsoft Corporation (through its acquisition of Frontbridge), FireEye, Inc., Symantec Corporation (through its acquisitions of Brightmail and MessageLabs), Mimecast Ltd, Barracuda Networks, Inc. and Google, Inc. (through its acquisition of Postini). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Archiving: Micro Focus International plc and Veritas Technologies LLC (through its acquisitions of KVS and LiveOffice while under the ownership of Symantec Corporation). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe we compete favorably based on the following factors:
  
• | effectiveness of our protection against advanced threats;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | comprehensiveness and integration of the solution;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | flexibility of delivery models;
--+--------------------------------


• | total cost of ownership;
--+-------------------------


• | scalability and performance;
--+-----------------------------


• | customer support; and
--+----------------------


• | extensibility of platform.
--+---------------------------

 Certain of our competitors have greater sales, marketing and financial resources, more extensive geographic presence and greater name recognition than we do. We may face future competition in our markets from other large, established companies, as well as from emerging companies. In addition, we expect that there is likely to be continued consolidation in our industry that could lead to increased price competition and other forms of competition.
 Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology. As of December 31, 2018, we had 120 patents and 54 patent applications. We have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our solutions are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products with the same functionality as our solution. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult.
 We expect that software and other solutions in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,613 employees. We also engage a number of temporary employees and consultants. None of our employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Competition for qualified personnel remains intense and we may not be successful in retaining our key employees or attracting skilled personnel.
