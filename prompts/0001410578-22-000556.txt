Item 1.     Business
OVERVIEW
We are a clinical-stage immunotherapy and targeted oncology company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for patients with solid tumor cancers. We are evaluating our lead antibody product candidate, cosibelimab, an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (“PD-L1”) antibody licensed from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (“Dana-Farber”), in an ongoing global, open-label, multicohort Phase 1 clinical trial in checkpoint therapy-naïve patients with selected recurrent or metastatic cancers, including ongoing cohorts in locally advanced and metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“CSCC”) intended to support one or more applications for marketing approval. In addition, we are evaluating our lead small-molecule, targeted anti-cancer agent, olafertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) inhibitor, as a potential new treatment for patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”).
In January 2022, we announced topline results from a cohort of the registration-enabling Phase 1 clinical trial of cosibelimab administered as a fixed dose of 800 mg every two weeks in patients with metastatic CSCC. The cohort met its primary endpoint, with cosibelimab demonstrating a confirmed objective response rate (“ORR”) of 47.4% (95% CI: 36.0, 59.1) based on independent central review of 78 patients enrolled in the metastatic CSCC cohort using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (“RECIST 1.1”).
In December 2021, we announced the initiation of our CONTERNO study, a global, open-label, multi-center, randomized Phase 3 trial of cosibelimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC. The primary endpoint for the CONTERNO Phase 3 trial is overall survival (“OS”), and key secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (“PFS”), ORR and safety.
We have also entered into various collaboration agreements with TG Therapeutics, Inc. (“TGTX”), a related party, to develop and commercialize certain assets in connection with our licenses in the field of hematological malignancies, while we retain the right to develop and commercialize these assets in solid tumors.
To date, we have not received approval for the sale of any product candidate in any market and, therefore, have not generated any product sales from any product candidates. In addition, we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception, and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. As of December 31, 2021, we have an accumulated deficit of $199.9 million.
We are a majority-controlled subsidiary of Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress”).

PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT
Immuno-Oncology Agents
Cosibelimab (Anti-PD-L1) Program
Cosibelimab (formerly referred to as CK-301) is a fully-human monoclonal antibody of IgG1 subtype that directly binds to PD-L1 and blocks the PD-L1 interaction with the Programmed Death Receptor-1 (“PD-1”) and B7.1 receptors. Cosibelimab’s primary mechanism of action is based on the inhibition of the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors PD-1 and B7.1, which removes the suppressive effects of PD-L1 on anti-tumor CD8+ T-cells to restore the cytotoxic T cell response. Additionally, cosibelimab has a functional Fc domain that may be capable of inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (“ADCC”) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (“CDC”) against tumor cells.
Numerous preclinical and clinical studies of third-parties have demonstrated that antibodies that block the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, or those that block only the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 can augment anti-tumor T-cell responses and lead to complete and lasting tumor eradication in a certain proportion of patients. Confirmed ORRs in the labels for the FDA approved PD-1 and PD-L1 blocking antibodies were cited in the 20-45% range based on clinical trials in patients with metastatic melanoma and NSCLC. Potent therapeutic anti-tumor responses due to blocking of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction have been demonstrated by these approved products in patients with various solid tumors including, but not limited to, NSCLC, melanoma, RCC, head and neck cancer, CSCC and urothelial carcinoma.
We are developing cosibelimab in solid tumor oncology indications where studies of other PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies have shown to be effective. We licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to certain anti-PD-L1 antibodies from Dana-Farber in March 2015. Also in March 2015, we entered into a Global Collaboration Agreement with TGTX, a related party, to develop and commercialize anti-PD-L1 antibodies in the field of hematological malignancies. We retain the right to develop and commercialize our anti-PD-L1 antibodies in solid tumors. We believe that cosibelimab has the potential to be effective in many oncological indications as a monotherapy or in combination with other anti-tumor immune response potentiating compounds and targeted therapies.
We commenced a Phase 1 multi-center clinical study for cosibelimab in October 2017. The study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of cosibelimab in checkpoint therapy-naïve patients with selected recurrent or metastatic cancers. Following completion of dose escalation in March 2018, multiple dose expansion cohorts were initiated, including ongoing cohorts in locally advanced and metastatic CSCC, intended to support one or more applications for marketing approval. The primary endpoint is ORR, and secondary endpoints include duration of response, PFS, and OS. In January 2022, we announced topline results from a cohort of this study with cosibelimab administered as a fixed dose of 800 mg every two weeks in patients with metastatic CSCC. The cohort met its primary endpoint, with cosibelimab demonstrating a confirmed ORR of 47.4% (95% CI: 36.0, 59.1) based on independent central review of 78 patients enrolled in the metastatic CSCC cohort using RECIST 1.1. Based on these results, Checkpoint intends to submit a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for cosibelimab in late 2022, to be followed by a marketing authorization application (“MAA”) submission in Europe and additional potential submissions in markets worldwide.
We commenced our CONTERNO study, a global, randomized Phase 3 trial of cosibelimab in December 2021. The CONTERNO study is an open-label, multi-center, randomized trial investigating cosibelimab combined with pemetrexed and investigator’s choice of platinum chemotherapy (either carboplatin or cisplatin) versus pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy alone in patients with previously untreated stage IV non-squamous NSCLC and with no EGFR mutations or ALK translocations. The primary endpoint for the CONTERNO Phase 3 trial is OS, and key secondary endpoints include PFS, ORR and safety. The study is designed to potentially support full regulatory approvals worldwide.
CK-302 (Anti-GITR) Program
Our anti-GITR monoclonal antibody, CK-302, is a fully human agonistic antibody that is designed to bind to and trigger signaling in GITR expressing cells. Scientific literature indicates that GITR is a co-stimulatory molecule of the TNF receptor family and is expressed 

3



on activated T cells, B cells, natural killer (“NK”) and regulatory T-cells (“Treg”). As a co-stimulatory molecule, GITR engagement increases proliferation, activation, and cytokine production of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. We believe our anti-GITR monoclonal antibody has the potential to abrogate immunosuppressive activity of natural Treg on expansion of T-effector cells. GITR-specific agonistic monoclonal antibodies under development by third parties have been shown to induce tumor regression in vivo through the activation of CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells and NK cells in a number of tumor models.
We licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to anti-GITR antibodies from Dana-Farber in March 2015. Also in March 2015, we entered into a Global Collaboration Agreement with TGTX to develop and commercialize anti-GITR antibodies in the field of hematological malignancies. We retain the right to develop and commercialize anti-GITR antibodies in solid tumors. We believe that an anti-GITR antibody has the potential to be effective in one or more oncological indications as a monotherapy or in combination with an anti-PD-L1 antibody as well as other anti-tumor immune response potentiating compounds and targeted therapies.
Currently, we are in preclinical development for this program.
Targeted Anti-Cancer Agents
Olafertinib (also known as CK-101 and RX518) EGFR Inhibitor Program 
We are developing olafertinib as an oral, third-generation, irreversible kinase inhibitor against selective mutations of EGFR. Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR such as L858R and exon 19 deletion are found in approximately 20% of patients with advanced NSCLC. Compared to chemotherapy, first-generation EGFR inhibitors significantly improved ORR and PFS in previously untreated NSCLC patients carrying EGFR mutations. However, tumor progression could develop due to resistance mutations, often within months of treatment with first-generation EGFR inhibitors. 
The EGFR T790M “gatekeeper” mutation is the most common resistance mutation found in patients treated with first-generation EGFR inhibitors. The mutation decreases the affinity of first-generation inhibitors to EGFR kinase domain, rendering the drugs ineffective. Second-generation EGFR inhibitors have improved in vitro potency against the T790M mutation but have not provided meaningful benefits in NSCLC patients due to toxicity from also inhibiting wild-type EGFR. 
Third-generation EGFR inhibitors are designed to be highly selective against one or more EGFR activating mutations and the T790M resistance mutation with minimal inhibition of wild-type EGFR, thereby potentially improving tolerability and safety profiles. In November 2015, Tagrisso® (osimertinib), a third-generation EGFR inhibitor developed by AstraZeneca plc, received accelerated FDA approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who have progressed on or after receiving EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Tagrisso received full approval from the FDA in 2017 based on data from a randomized, Phase 3 trial, in which Tagrisso significantly improved PFS versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, providing 10.1 months of median PFS compared to 4.4 months from chemotherapy. Subsequently, in April 2018, Tagrisso received FDA approval for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have the EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R activating mutations based on data from a randomized, Phase 3 trial in which Tagrisso significantly improved PFS versus first-generation EGFR inhibitors, providing 18.9 months of median PFS compared to 10.2 months from the EGFR inhibitor comparators, erlotinib or gefitinib.
We are developing olafertinib for the potential treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations. We believe that olafertinib has the potential to be effective in this population as a monotherapy or in combination with other anti-tumor immune response potentiating compounds. 
In March 2015, Fortress entered into an exclusive license agreement with NeuPharma, Inc., which agreement was assigned to us by Fortress on the same date, to develop and commercialize novel covalent third-generation EGFR inhibitors on a worldwide basis outside of certain Asian countries. In August 2016, the FDA accepted our Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in September 2016. The trial is evaluating the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of olafertinib in patients with advanced solid tumors to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the safety and efficacy of olafertinib in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. In September 2018, we announced preliminary interim data in an oral presentation at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer in Toronto. In November 2020, NeuPharma, Inc. commenced a Phase 3 clinical trial in China evaluating olafertinib in treatment-naïve locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations. We have met with the FDA to discuss the adequacy of the ongoing Phase 3 trial in China.

CK-103 BET Inhibitor Program
We are developing CK-103, a novel, selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of bromodomain and extra-terminal (“BET”) bromodomains. CK-103 binds to the first and second bromodomains (BD1, BD2) of the BET protein family, BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT. A bromodomain is an amino acid protein domain that recognizes acetylated-lysine. The binding of the drug prevents interaction between BET proteins and both acetylated histones and transcription factors. Therefore, BET proteins, such as BRD4, are considered potential therapeutic targets in cancer, as they may play a pivotal role in regulating the transcription of key regulators of cancer cell growth and survival, including the c-Myc oncogene. BRD4 is often required for expression of c-Myc. Scientific literature has shown that small molecule inhibition of BET bromodomains may lead to selective killing of tumor cells across a broad range of hematologic malignancies and certain targeted solid tumors. We plan to develop CK-103 for the treatment of various advanced and metastatic solid tumor cancers, including, but not limited to, those associated with elevated c-Myc expression.
In May 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Jubilant Biosys Limited to develop and commercialize novel compounds that inhibit BET bromodomains on a worldwide basis. Also in May 2016, we entered into a Sublicense Agreement with TGTX to develop and commercialize CK-103 in the field of hematological malignancies. We retain the right to develop and commercialize CK-103 in solid tumors. Currently, we have completed the required CMC, pharmacology and toxicology activities that we believe will support an IND application filing.
Anti-CAIX Research Program
Our anti-carbonic anhydrase IX (“CAIX”) antibody is a fully human preclinical antibody designed to recognize CAIX expressing cells and kill them via ADCC and CDC. Scientific literature indicates that CAIX is a well characterized tumor associated antigen with expression almost exclusively limited to the cells of renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). More than 85% of RCC cases have been demonstrated to express high levels of CAIX expression. There is very limited expression of this antigen on healthy tissue which we believe will limit reactivity of this antibody against healthy tissues.
In 2015, preclinical data were published in the peer-reviewed journal, Molecular Cancer, that demonstrated that our anti-CAIX antibodies could trigger killing of CAIX-positive human RCC cell lines in tissue culture via ADCC and CDC. The killing activity correlated positively with the level of CAIX expression on RCC tumor cell lines. In addition, the study demonstrated that our anti-CAIX antibodies inhibited growth of CAIX-positive tumors in a mouse xenograft model as well as led to the activation of T-cells and NK cells. 
We licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to certain anti-CAIX antibodies from Dana-Farber in March 2015. Currently, we are in preclinical development for this program.

Completion dates and costs in the above table are estimates due to the uncertainties associated with clinical trials and the related requirements of development. In the cases where the requirements for clinical trials and development programs have not been fully defined, or are dependent on the success of other trials, we cannot estimate trial completion or cost with any certainty. The actual spending on each trial during the year is also dependent on funding.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS
General
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, broad intellectual property protection for our product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors (“know-how”). To help protect our proprietary know-how which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
Patents and other proprietary rights are crucial to the development of our business. We will be able to protect our proprietary technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents, supported by regulatory exclusivity, or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We cannot guarantee the scope of protection of the issued patents, or that such patents will survive a validity or enforceability challenge, or that any of the pending patent applications will issue as patents.
Generally, patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy for a period of 18 months or more. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Therefore, we cannot predict the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents, the continued patent eligibility of certain subject matter, or their enforceability. To date, there has been no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents. Third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications, if issued. If our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention or inventorship, which could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before we commercialize any of our products, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of the patent. However, the life of a patent covering a product that has been subject to regulatory approval may have the ability to be extended through the patent restoration program, although any such extension could still be minimal and, in any case, is limited to a maximum of five additional years of patent term. But that maximum of five additional years is, itself, subject to a cap of a maximum of 14 years of patent protection from the date of marketing approval.
In March 2015, we licensed intellectual property related to certain antibodies from Dana-Farber. The intellectual property includes issued patents in a number of countries, including the United States and Europe, as well as pending patent applications in several countries elsewhere. The issued patents and pending patent applications relate generally to compositions and methods of treatment involving antibodies against PD-L1, CAIX, and GITR. 
The PD-L1 segment of the portfolio includes two granted U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,828,434 and 10,604,581) directed to antibodies that bind to PD-L1 and methods of augmenting a patient’s immune response by administering an anti-PD-L1 antibody, respectively. The ‘434 patent is scheduled to expire October 4, 2033, and the ‘581 patent is scheduled to expire November 18, 2033, not including any patent term restorations, which might become available under the provisions of U.S. patent laws, based on regulatory delays associated with obtaining marketing approval. Two Australian (AU 2013326901 and 2018226425), one Japanese (JP 6461800), one South Korean (KR 101947702), one Israeli (IL 237737), one Mexican (MX 370848), one Colombian (CO 34878), one Canadian 

6



(CA 2886433), and two Chinese (CN 104994873 and CN 10782719) counterpart patents have issued, and additional international counterpart applications are pending in Canada, China, Europe and Hong Kong. The issued international patents and any patents maturing from these pending applications will expire no sooner than October 2033. In June 2016, Checkpoint also filed a company-owned U.S. provisional application (U.S. 62/356,105) directed to antibodies and functional fragments thereof that bind to human PD-L1, and methods of inhibiting tumor cell proliferation in patients using such antibodies or functional fragments. The provisional application was converted into a PCT application (PCT/US2017/039810) in June 2017, and a U.S. non-provisional application (U.S. Appl. No. 15/636,610) was filed at the same time. The ’610 application has now issued as U.S. Patent No. 10,590,199 with claims directed to specific anti-PD-L1 antibodies and fragments thereof, as well as methods of treating tumors/cancers with anti-PD-L1 antibodies and fragments thereof. The ’199 patent is scheduled to expire on May 31, 2038, not including any patent term restorations, which might become available under the provisions of U.S. patent laws, based on regulatory delays associated with obtaining marketing approval. A further U.S. application, U.S. Appl. No. 16/818,621, was filed before the issuance of the ‘199 patent and is currently pending. An Israeli counterpart patent has also granted (IL 263611), and additional national stage applications are pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore and Thailand. Any patents maturing from these pending applications will expire no sooner than June 2037.
The CAIX segment of the portfolio includes three granted U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,466,263, 10,450,383, and 11,174,323) and one pending U.S. application (U.S. Appl. No. 17/498,582). The ‘263 patent is directed to isolated human monoclonal antibodies and scFv antibodies that bind to CAIX (G250) protein, and compositions and kits comprising such antibodies. The term of the ‘263 patent runs to July 9, 2029. The ‘383 patent is directed to methods of treating cancer with anti-CAIX antibodies, and its term runs until April 28, 2027. The ‘323 patent is directed to methods of treating renal cancer with anti-CAIX antibodies, and its term runs until February 11, 2027. The ‘263 patent, the ‘383 patent, the ‘323 patent, and any patent issuing from the ‘867 application may be entitled to any patent term restorations that might become available under the provisions of U.S. patent laws, based on regulatory delays associated with obtaining marketing approval. The European counterpart patent (EP 1979379) is in force in Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. A Canadian counterpart patent (CA 2,632,094) has also been issued. Both the European and Canadian counterpart patents, as well as any pending applications outside the United States, are scheduled to expire no sooner than December 2026.
The GITR segment of the portfolio includes an International Application No. PCT/US2015/054010, filed in October 2015, and International Application No. PCT/US2017/043504, filed in July 2017. All of the national stage applications claiming priority to PCT/US2015/054010 have lapsed; however, there is one granted patent (U.S. Patent No. 10,463,732) in this family. The ‘732 patent will not expire until at least October 2035, barring any patent term restorations that might become available under the provisions of U.S. patent laws. National stage applications claiming priority to PCT/US2017/043504 are pending in the U.S. (U.S. Appl. No. 16/319,590), Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Russian, New Zealand and Mexico. Any of these national stage applications that issue or grant as patents (including U.S. Application No. 16/319,590) would expire no earlier than July 2037. One U.S. patent (U.S. 11,046,777) has issued in the patent family claiming priority to PCT/UC2017/043504, and this U.S. patent will not expire until at least July 2037, barring any patent term restorations that might become available under the provisions of the U.S. patent laws.
In March 2015, Fortress in-licensed intellectual property from NeuPharma, assigned to us by Fortress on the same date, which is directed to technology involving small molecules that are inhibitors of EGFR and kinase mutants, including the compound olafertinib. EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase of the ErbB family and is also known as “Her1” and “ErbB1.” The in-licensed patent estate includes four granted U.S. patents, a granted European patent, a granted patent in Hong Kong, a granted patent in Singapore, a granted patent in the Philippines, a granted Japanese patent, a granted South Korean patent, a granted Malaysian patent, two granted Australian patents, a granted New Zealand patent, two granted Israeli patents, a granted Mexican patent and a granted Russian patent. U.S. Patent No. 9,550,770 is directed to a generic formula of small molecules and also has a specific claim directed to the compound, olafertinib. The granted claims also cover pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutical compositions, particular dosage forms and packaged goods. U.S. Patent No. 9,849,139 is directed to methods of inhibiting EGFR or an EGFR mutant in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of the ‘770 patent, including the compound, olafertinib. U.S. Patent No. 10,172,868 is directed to methods of treating non-small cell lung cancer with a specific list of compounds, including the compound, olafertinib. U.S. Patent No. 10,653,701 is directed to methods of treating skin cancer or lung cancer with a substituted quinazoline compound comprising an electrophilic group capable of forming a covalent bond with a nucleophile, which includes the compounds of the ‘868 patent (e.g., the compound, olafertinib). Additionally, there is a pending U.S. application in this family (U.S. Appl. No. 16/843,610) that was recently allowed, but has not yet issued, a further pending U.S. application (U.S. Appl. No. 17/681,387) has been filed. The granted foreign patents cover the compound, olafertinib, and a broad range of related compounds, salts, pharmaceutical 

7



compositions, including various dosage forms of such pharmaceutical compositions and certain uses of such compounds or salts thereof in treating cancer, a disorder mediated by EGFR, or NSCLC, either alone or in combination with an additional anti-cancer and/or cytotoxic agent. The term of granted U.S. and foreign patents runs to August 22, 2034, not including any patent term restorations in the U.S., which might become available under the provisions of U.S. patent laws, based on regulatory delays associated with obtaining marketing approval. Additional counterpart applications exist in jurisdictions around the world, including, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, Brazil, India, China and Europe. Any patents maturing from these pending applications would be scheduled to expire no sooner than August 2034. Checkpoint has also licensed from NeuPharma an additional international application, PCT/US2019/017117, which was filed on February 7, 2019, and it directed to additional EGFR inhibitors and methods of using the same. National stage applications claiming priority to PCT/US2019/017117 are pending in the U.S. (U.S. Appl. No. 16/967,696), Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand. Any of these national stage applications that issue or grant as patents (including U.S. Application No. 16/967,696) would expire no earlier than February 2039.
In May 2016, we in-licensed intellectual property from Jubilant. Under the terms of the license agreement, Jubilant granted us exclusive, worldwide rights under Jubilant’s patents and know-how covering small molecule inhibitors of BET, specifically targeting BRD4, a member of the BET family, which is often required for the expression of c-Myc. The in-licensed patent estate includes two international (PCT) applications, filed in March 2016 (PCT/IN2016/050098) and September 2016 (PCT/IN2016/050300), respectively, which claim the benefit of two earlier-filed Indian provisional applications. This patent estate has three granted U.S. patents, a granted Indian patent, two granted Japanese patents, two granted Australian patents, two granted Russian patents, a granted Israeli patent, two granted patents in Hong Kong, two granted Chinese patents, two granted Mexican patents, and two granted European patents that have each been validated across a broad range of European countries. National stage applications claiming priority to PCT/IN2016/050098 or PCT/IN2016/050300 are pending in Brazil, Canada, Israel, India, South Korea, New Zealand, Thailand and the U.S. U.S. Patent No. 10,689,390, which is the U.S. national phase entry of PCT/IN2016/050098, is directed to a generic formula of small molecule BET inhibitors and specifically claims exemplified small molecule BET inhibitors. The granted claims of the ‘390 patent also cover pharmaceutical compositions. Pending U.S. Application (U.S. Appl. No.16/869,517) is directed to methods of treatment with the compounds claimed in the ‘390 patent, including inhibiting one or more BET family bromodomains in the cell and treating a condition mediated by one or more BET family bromodomains. U.S. Patent No. 10,689,395, which is the U.S. national phase entry of PCT/IN2016/050300, is directed to a generic formula of small molecule BET inhibitors that cover half of the exemplified small molecule BET inhibitors disclosed in PCT/IN2016/050300. The granted claims of the ‘395 patent also cover pharmaceutical compositions and a method of treating cancer. U.S. Patent No. 11,267,820, which is a continuation of the ‘395 patent, is directed to the remaining half of the exemplified compounds disclosed in PCT/IN2016/050300 and has claims similar to those granted from the ‘395 patent. Any patents maturing from this patent estate are expected to expire in 2036.
Other Intellectual Property Rights
We depend upon trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. To maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, we require our employees, scientific advisors, consultants and collaborators, upon commencement of a relationship with us, to execute confidentiality agreements and, in the case of parties other than our research and development collaborators, to agree to assign their inventions to us. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed in connection with their relationship with us. These agreements may not, however, provide protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information.
In addition to patent protection, we may utilize orphan drug designation or other provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended (“FDCA”), to provide market exclusivity for certain of our product candidates. Orphan drug regulations provide incentives to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases, currently defined as diseases that exist in fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or, diseases that affect more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. but that the sponsor does not realistically anticipate will generate a net profit. Under these provisions, a manufacturer of a designated orphan drug can seek tax benefits, and the holder of the first FDA approval of a designated orphan drug product will be granted a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity for such FDA-approved orphan drug product. In September 2017, we received FDA Orphan Drug Designation for olafertinib for the treatment of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.

LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND COLLABORATIONS
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc.
In March 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Dana-Farber, which license was amended effective on October 5, 2015, April 12, 2016, and October 24, 2016, for an exclusive, worldwide license to Dana-Farber’s patents for a portfolio of fully human immuno-oncology targeted antibodies. The field of use license includes all prophylactic, therapeutic or diagnostic uses in humans or animals excluding use in chimeric antigen receptor technology. The Dana-Farber antibodies were generated in the laboratory of Dr. Wayne Marasco, MD, PhD, a Professor in the Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS at Dana-Farber. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid Dana-Farber an up-front licensing fee of $1.0 million and, on May 11, 2015, granted Dana-Farber five percent of our common stock on a fully-diluted basis, equal to 500,000 shares valued at $32,500 or $0.065 per share. The agreement included an anti-dilution clause that maintained Dana-Farber’s ownership at 5% until such time that we raised $10 million in cash in exchange for common shares. Pursuant to this provision, on September 30, 2015, we granted to Dana-Farber an additional 136,830 shares of common stock valued at approximately $0.6 million and the anti-dilution clause thereafter expired. Dana-Farber is eligible to receive payments of up to an aggregate of approximately $21.5 million for each licensed product upon our successful achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and first commercial sale milestones. In addition, Dana-Farber is eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $60.0 million upon our successful achievement of certain sales milestones based on aggregate net sales, in addition to royalty payments based on a tiered low to mid-single digit percentage of net sales. Dana-Farber also receives an annual license maintenance fee of $50,000, which is creditable against milestone payments or royalties due to Dana-Farber. The portfolio of antibodies licensed from Dana-Farber include antibodies targeting PD-L1, GITR and CAIX. The license will terminate on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the royalty term in such country with respect to such product expires, at which time the agreement will expire in its entirety with respect to such product in such country. The royalty term, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, is the later of (i) ten years after first commercial sale of a given product in such country, or (ii) the expiration of the last-to-expire Dana-Farber patent containing a valid claim to the product in such country. To date, we have incurred $6.2 million of upfront licensing and milestone payments under this license agreement.
In connection with the license agreement with Dana-Farber, in March 2015 we entered into a collaboration agreement with TGTX, which was amended and restated in June 2019, to develop and commercialize the anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibody research programs in the field of hematological malignancies. We retain the right to develop and commercialize these antibodies in solid tumors. Michael Weiss, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Checkpoint and Fortress’ Executive Vice Chairman, Strategic Development, is also the Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and a stockholder of TGTX. Under the terms of the original collaboration agreement, TGTX paid us $0.5 million, representing an upfront licensing fee. Upon the signing of the amended and restated collaboration agreement in June 2019, TGTX paid us an additional $1.0 million upfront licensing fee. We are eligible to receive substantive potential milestone payments for the anti-PD-L1 program of up to an aggregate of approximately $27.6 million upon TGTX’s successful achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and first commercial sale milestones. This is comprised of up to approximately $8.4 million upon TGTX’s successful completion of clinical development milestones, and up to approximately $19.2 million upon regulatory filings and first commercial sales in specified territories. We are also eligible to receive substantive potential milestone payments for the anti-GITR antibody program of up to an aggregate of approximately $21.5 million upon TGTX’s successful achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and first commercial sale milestones. This is comprised of up to approximately $7.0 million upon TGTX’s successful completion of clinical development milestones, and up to approximately $14.5 million upon first commercial sales in specified territories. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $60.0 million upon TGTX’s successful achievement of certain sales milestones based on aggregate net sales for both programs, in addition to royalty payments based on a tiered low double-digit percentage of net sales. We also receive an annual license maintenance fee, which is creditable against milestone payments or royalties due to us. TGTX also pays us for our out-of-pocket costs of material used by TGTX for their development activities. The collaboration agreement will terminate on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last licensed patent right, unless the agreement is earlier terminated. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized approximately $0.2 million and $1.0 million respectively, in revenue from our collaboration agreement with TGTX in the Statements of Operations. The year ended December 31, 2020 included a milestone payment of $925,000 upon the 12th patient dosed in a phase 1 clinical trial for the anti-PD-L1 antibody cosibelimab during March 2020.
Adimab, LLC
In October 2015, Fortress entered into a collaboration agreement with Adimab to discover and optimize antibodies using their proprietary core technology platform. Under this agreement, Adimab optimized cosibelimab (formerly referred to as CK-301), our anti-PD-L1 

9



antibody which we originally licensed from Dana-Farber. In January 2019, Fortress transferred the rights to the optimized antibody to us, and we entered into a collaboration agreement directly with Adimab on the same day. Under the terms of the agreement, Adimab is eligible to receive payments up to an aggregate of approximately $7.1 million upon our successful achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones, of which $4.8 million are due upon various filings for regulatory approvals to commercialize the product. In addition, Adimab is eligible to receive royalty payments based on a tiered low single digit percentage of net sales. The license will terminate on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the royalty term in such country with respect to such product expires, at which time the agreement will expire in its entirety with respect to such licensed product in such country. The royalty term, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, begins on the first commercial sale of a product in a country and ends on the later of (a) expiry of the last-to-expire licensor patent containing a valid claim to the compound in such country; or (b) twelve years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. To date, we have incurred $3.7 million in milestone payments under our collaboration agreement with Adimab.
NeuPharma, Inc.
In March 2015, Fortress entered into an exclusive license agreement with NeuPharma to develop and commercialize novel irreversible, 3rd generation EGFR inhibitors, including olafertinib, on a worldwide basis other than certain Asian countries. On the same date, Fortress assigned all of its right and interest in the EGFR inhibitors to us. The license agreement was amended on February 21, 2017. Under the terms of the license agreement, we paid NeuPharma an up-front licensing fee of $1.0 million, and NeuPharma is eligible to receive payments of up to an aggregate of approximately $40.0 million upon our successful achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones in up to three indications, of which $22.5 million are due upon various regulatory approvals to commercialize the products. In addition, NeuPharma is eligible to receive payments of up to an aggregate of $40.0 million upon our successful achievement of certain sales milestones based on aggregate net sales, in addition to royalty payments based on a tiered mid to high-single digit percentage of net sales. The license will terminate on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the royalty term in such country with respect to such product expires, at which time the agreement will expire in its entirety with respect to such product in such country. Royalty term means, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, the period from the first commercial sale of a given licensed product in such country until the later of (a) expiry of the last-to-expire licensor patent containing a valid claim to the compound in such country; or (b) the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. In a country where no licensor patent containing a valid claim with respect to the compound has ever existed nor ever exists, the royalty term means on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, the period from the first commercial sale of such product in such country until the 10th anniversary of such first commercial sale of such product in such country. To date, we have incurred $2.0 million of upfront licensing and milestone payments under the license agreement.
Jubilant Biosys Limited
In May 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Jubilant for an exclusive, worldwide license to Jubilant’s family of patents covering compounds that inhibit BET proteins such as BRD4, including CK-103. The license agreement was amended on December 13, 2016 and March 31, 2017. Under the terms of the license agreement, we paid Jubilant an up-front licensing fee of $2.0 million, and Jubilant is eligible to receive payments up to an aggregate of approximately $89.0 million upon our successful achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones, of which $59.5 million are due upon various regulatory approvals to commercialize the products. In addition, Jubilant is eligible to receive payments up to an aggregate of $89.0 million upon our successful achievement of certain sales milestones based on aggregate net sales, in addition to royalty payments based on a tiered low to mid-single digit percentage of net sales. The license will terminate on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the royalty term in such country with respect to such product expires, at which time the agreement will expire in its entirety with respect to such licensed product in such country. The royalty term, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, begins on the first commercial sale of a product in a country and ends on the expiration of the last-to-expire Jubilant patent containing a valid claim to the product in such country. To date, we have incurred $2.4 million of upfront licensing and milestone payments under the license agreement. 
In connection with the license agreement with Jubilant, we entered into a sublicense agreement with TGTX, a related party, to develop and commercialize the compounds licensed in the field of hematological malignancies, while we retain the right to develop and commercialize these compounds in the field of solid tumors. Under the terms of the sublicense agreement, TGTX paid us $1.0 million, representing an upfront licensing fee, and we are eligible to receive substantive potential milestone payments up to an aggregate of approximately $87.2 million upon TGTX’s successful achievement of clinical development and regulatory milestones. This is comprised of up to approximately $25.5 million upon TGTX’s successful completion of three clinical development milestones for two licensed products, and up to approximately $61.7 million upon the achievement of five regulatory approvals and first commercial sales in 

10



specified territories for two licensed products. In addition, we are eligible to receive potential milestone payments up to an aggregate of $89.0 million upon TGTX’s successful achievement of certain sales milestones based on aggregate net sales by TGTX, for two licensed products, in addition to royalty payments based on a mid-single digit percentage of net sales by TGTX. TGTX also pays us for 50% of IND enabling costs and patent expenses. For each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized approximately $0.1 million in revenue related to the sublicense agreement in the Statements of Operations.
COMPETITION
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel, attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations, and license technologies that are competitive with ours. To compete successfully in this industry, we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments.
The drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies. In addition, a large number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same conditions that we are targeting. Other companies have products or product candidates in various stages of preclinical or clinical development, or with marketing approvals, to treat conditions for which we are also seeking to discover and develop product candidates. Some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our product candidates and may be commercialized earlier.
In the immuno-oncology area, almost every major pharmaceutical company has a PD-1 and/or PD-L1 antibody in clinical development or on the market, including, without limitation, Merck & Co. (approved drug PD-1 with the brand name Keytruda®), Bristol-Myers Squibb (approved PD-1 with the brand name Opdivo®), Roche (approved PD-L1 with the brand name Tecentriq®), AstraZeneca (approved PD-L1 with the brand name Imfinzi®), Pfizer/Merck KGA (approved PD-L1 with the brand name Bavencio®), Regeneron (approved PD-1 with the brand name Libtayo®) and GlaxoSmithKline (approved PD-1 with the brand name Jemperli®). We are aware of several anti-GITR antibody development programs that are or were in preclinical or early clinical studies, including, without limitation, by Merck & Co., Leap Therapeutics, Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc., and an anti-CAIX antibody in clinical studies by Telix Pharmaceuticals.
In the targeted anti-cancer agent area, there are several companies with marketing approvals or in development with EGFR inhibitors that are targeting mutations similar to our programs. There are also a number of early stage programs developing BET inhibitors which could overlap with our upcoming programs.
In the EGFR inhibitor space, Tarceva®, Iressa®, Gilotrif®, Tagrisso® and Vizimpro® are currently approved drugs for the treatment of first-line EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC in the United States. AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso is also approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who have progressed on or after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and for the adjuvant treatment of patients with early stage EGFR mutation positive NSCLC. In addition, we are aware of a number of products in development targeting cancer-causing mutant forms of EGFR for the treatment of NSCLC patients, including, Novartis’ nazartinib, Janssen’s lazertinib, and EQRx’s almonertinib.
In the BET inhibitor space, there are a number of companies which have advanced to early stage clinical trials, including Constellation Pharmaceuticals’ pelabresib, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s BMS-986158, GlaxoSmithKline’s molibresib, Abbvie’s mivebresib, Incyte’s INCB57643 and Zenith Epigenetics’s ZEN003694.
Additional information can be found under Item 1A - Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Industry.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2021, we had fourteen full and part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good.

SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING
We have limited experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes. We currently do not have any manufacturing capabilities. We have established, or intend to establish, contract manufacturing relationships for the supplies of our product candidates, in each case with a single manufacturer. As with any supply program, obtaining raw materials of the correct quality cannot be guaranteed and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in this endeavor.
At the time of commercial sale, if not prior, and to the extent possible and commercially practicable, we plan to seek to engage a back-up supplier for each of our product candidates. Until such time, we expect that we will rely on a single contract manufacturer to produce each of our product candidates under current GMP (“cGMP”) regulations. Our third-party manufacturers have a limited number of facilities in which our product candidates can be produced and will have limited experience in manufacturing our product candidates in quantities sufficient for commercialization. Our third-party manufacturers will have other clients and may have other priorities that could affect their ability to perform the work satisfactorily and/or on a timely basis. Both of these occurrences would be beyond our control. 
We expect to similarly rely on contract manufacturing relationships for any products that we may in-license or acquire in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contract with such manufacturers on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
Contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other state and federal regulations. Our contractors outside of the United States face similar challenges from the numerous local and regional agencies and authorized bodies.. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards, other than through contractual obligations. If they are deemed out of compliance with cGMPs, product recalls could result, inventory could be destroyed, production could be stopped, and supplies could be delayed or otherwise disrupted.
If we need to change manufacturers after commercialization, the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these new manufacturers in advance, which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory agency regulations and standards and may require significant lead times and delay. Furthermore, switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATIONS
Numerous governmental authorities, including the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies, impose substantial regulations upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of our product candidates, as well as our ongoing research and development activities. None of our product candidates have been approved for sale in any market in which we have marketing rights. Before marketing in the U.S., any drug that we develop must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the FDCA. The FDA regulates, among other things, the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, approval, manufacturing, record keeping, adverse event reporting, packaging, labeling, storage, advertising, promotion, export, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products.
The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. We are required to submit extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each indication or use to establish a product candidate’s safety and efficacy before we can secure FDA approval to market or sell a product in the U.S. The approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies or surveillance. Before commencing clinical trials in humans, we must submit an IND to the FDA, or comparable filing outside the U.S., containing, among other things, pre-clinical data, chemistry, manufacturing and control information, and an investigative plan. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.

12



The FDA may permit expedited development, evaluation, and marketing of new therapies intended to treat persons with serious or life-threatening conditions for which there is an unmet medical need under its fast track drug development programs. A sponsor can apply for fast track designation at the time of submission of an IND, or at any time prior to receiving marketing approval of the new drug application (“NDA”) or BLA. To receive fast track designation, an applicant must demonstrate:

● | that the drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | that the drug is intended to treat a serious aspect of the condition; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs, and this potential is being evaluated in the planned drug development program.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA must respond to a request for fast track designation within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Over the course of drug development, a product in a fast track development program must continue to meet the criteria for fast track designation. Sponsors of products in fast track drug development programs must be in regular contact with the reviewing division of the FDA to ensure that the evidence necessary to support marketing approval will be developed and presented in a format conducive to an efficient review. Sponsors of products in fast track drug development programs ordinarily are eligible for priority review of a completed application in six months or less and also may be permitted to submit portions of an NDA or BLA to the FDA for review before the complete application is submitted.
Sponsors of drugs designated as fast track also may seek approval under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations. Under this authority, the FDA may grant marketing approval for a new drug product on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely, based on epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence, to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. Approval will be subject to the requirement that the applicant study the drug further to verify and describe its clinical benefit where there is uncertainty as to the relation of the surrogate endpoint to clinical benefit or uncertainty as to the relation of the observed clinical benefit to ultimate outcome. Post-marketing studies are usually underway at the time an applicant files the NDA or BLA. When required to be conducted, such post-marketing studies must also be adequate and well-controlled. The applicant must carry out any such post-marketing studies with due diligence. Many companies who have been granted the right to utilize an accelerated approval approach have failed to obtain approval. Moreover, negative or inconclusive results from the clinical trials we may conduct or adverse medical events could cause us to have to repeat or terminate the clinical trials. Accordingly, we may not be able to complete the clinical trials within an acceptable time frame, if at all, and, therefore, could not submit the NDA or BLA to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for marketing approval.
Clinical testing must meet requirements for institutional review board or ethics committee oversight, informed consent and good clinical practices, and must be conducted pursuant to an IND, unless exempted.
For purposes of NDA or BLA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases:

● | Phase 1: The drug is administered to a small group of humans, either healthy volunteers or patients, to test for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: Studies are conducted on a larger number of patients to assess the efficacy of the product, to ascertain dose tolerance and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional data relating to safety and potential adverse events.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: Studies establish safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 4: The FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to find out more about the drug’s long-term risks, benefits, and optimal use, or to test the drug in different populations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or that may increase the costs of these trials, include:

● | slow patient enrollment due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study, external factors such as pandemics or geopolitical conflicts or other factors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials or delays in approvals from a study site’s review board;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13




● | longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy or determine the appropriate product dose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | insufficient supply of the product candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | ineffectiveness of the product candidates.
--+-------------------------------------------

In addition, the FDA, equivalent foreign regulatory authority, or a data safety monitoring committee for a trial may place a clinical trial on hold or terminate it if it concludes that subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, or for futility. Any drug is likely to produce some toxicity or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for a sufficiently long period of time. Unacceptable toxicity or side effects may occur at any dose level at any time in the course of studies in animals designed to identify unacceptable effects of a product candidate, known as toxicological studies, or clinical trials of product candidates. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our product candidates and could ultimately prevent approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.
Sponsors of drugs may apply for a special protocol assessment (“SPA”) from the FDA. The SPA process is a procedure by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols that are intended to form the basis for a new drug application. However, final marketing approval depends on the results of efficacy, the adverse event profile and an evaluation of the benefit/risk of treatment demonstrated in the Phase 3 trial. The SPA agreement may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product safety or efficacy.
Before receiving FDA approval to market a product, we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for its intended use by submitting to the FDA an NDA or BLA containing the pre-clinical and clinical data that have been accumulated, together with chemistry and manufacturing and controls specifications and information, and proposed labeling, among other things. The FDA may refuse to accept an NDA or BLA for filing if certain content criteria are not met and, even after accepting an NDA or BLA, the FDA may often require additional information, including clinical data, before approval of marketing a product.
It is also becoming more common for the FDA to request a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), as part of an NDA or BLA. The REMS plan contains post-market obligations of the sponsor to train prescribing physicians, monitor off-label drug use, and conduct sufficient Phase 4 follow-up studies and registries to ensure the continued safe use of the drug.
As part of the approval process, the FDA must inspect and approve each manufacturing facility. Among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. Manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort to ensure continued compliance, and the FDA conducts periodic inspections to certify compliance. It may be difficult for our manufacturers or us to comply with the applicable cGMP, as interpreted by the FDA, and other FDA regulatory requirements. If we, or our contract manufacturers, fail to comply, then the FDA may not allow us to market products that have been affected by the failure.
If the FDA grants approval, the approval will be limited to those conditions and patient populations for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies. Further, a product may be marketed only in those dosage forms and for those indications approved in the NDA or BLA. Certain changes to an approved NDA or BLA, including, with certain exceptions, any significant changes to labeling, require approval of a supplemental application before the drug may be marketed as changed. Any products that we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing monitoring and regulation by the FDA, including compliance with cGMP and the reporting of adverse experiences with the drugs. The nature of marketing claims that the FDA will permit us to make in the labeling and advertising of our products will generally be limited to those specified in FDA approved labeling, and the advertising of our products will be subject to comprehensive monitoring and regulation by the FDA. Drugs whose review was accelerated may carry additional restrictions on marketing activities, including the requirement that all promotional materials are pre-submitted to the FDA. Claims exceeding those contained in approved labeling will constitute a violation of the FDCA. Violations of the FDCA or regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or marketing and sale following approval may result in agency enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, recall, seizure of products, warning letters, injunctions, fines and/or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Failure to comply with applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of new drugs are subject to future changes.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development. In addition, in the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) contains provisions that have the potential to substantially change healthcare delivery and financing, including impacting the profitability of drugs. For example, the Affordable Care Act revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs are calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of covered drugs dispensed to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and subjected manufacturers to new annual fees for certain branded prescription drugs. Given the complexity of the Affordable Care Act and the substantial requirements for regulation thereunder, the impact of the Affordable Care Act on our financial conditions and operations cannot be predicted, whether in its current form or as amended or repealed.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of any product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
