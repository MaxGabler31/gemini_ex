Our Company 
 Tilray Brands, Inc. (“Tilray”, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) is a global pioneer in cannabis, cultivation, production and distribution, incorporated in the State of Delaware on January 24, 2018. On April 30, 2021, Tilray acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Aphria Inc. via a plan of arrangement (the “Arrangement”). The business combination brought together two highly complementary businesses to create a leading cannabis-focused and consumer packaged goods company with one of the largest global geographic footprints in the industry.  With a focus on sustainability, our state-of-the-art greenhouses and cultivation operations, processing and distribution facilities make us one of the world’s leading fully-integrated cannabis companies.

We were among the first companies to be permitted to cultivate and sell legal medical cannabis. Today, we supply high-quality medical cannabis products to tens of thousands of patients in 20 countries spanning five continents through our global subsidiaries, and through agreements with established pharmaceutical distributors. 
 We are a leader in the recreational adult-use market in Canada where we offer a broad-based portfolio of adult-use brands and products, and continue to expand our portfolio to include new innovative cannabis products and formats. We maintain agreements to supply all Canadian provinces and territories with our adult-use products for sale through their established retail distribution systems. We believe that our differentiated portfolio of brands, which is designed to resonate with consumers in all categories, sets us apart from our competitors and is providing us with the ability to establish a leading position in the adult-use market in Canada. Therefore, we are investing in brand building with our consumers, new product innovation, insights, distribution, trade marketing and cannabis education to drive market share in the Canadian adult-use cannabis industry.
 On July 12, 2022, we closed a strategic alliance with HEXO. Through this alliance, both companies are expected to achieve substantial cost saving synergies and production efficiencies, with a target combined saving of $80 million within two years to be shared equally between the two companies. Additionally, we acquired 100% of the remaining outstanding principal balance of $173.7 million of the secured convertible note issued by HEXO to HT Investments MA LLC (“HTI”). The purchase price paid by Tilray Brands to HTI for the Amended Note was US$155 million, reflecting a 10.8% discount on the outstanding principal amount. The conversion price of the HEXO Note of CAD$0.40 per share, implies that, as of filing, Tilray Brands would have the right to convert into approximately 48% of the outstanding common stock of HEXO (on a non-diluted basis). The purchase price was satisfied, in part, by Tilray Brands’ issuance to HTI of a new $50 million convertible unsecured note (the “Tilray Convertible Note”) and approximately 33.3 million shares in Class 2 common stock of Tilray Brands. The Tilray Convertible Note bears interest at a rate of 4.00% per annum, calculated and paid on a quarterly basis and matures on September 1, 2023. HEXO did not receive any proceeds as a result of Tilray Brands’ purchase of the HEXO Note from HTI.
 Through Fresh Hemp Foods Ltd. (“Manitoba Harvest”), we are also a leading hemp food manufacturer.  Manitoba Harvest produces, manufactures, markets and distributes a broad-based portfolio of hemp-based food products, as well as retail lifestyle goods which are sold in major retailers across the U.S. and Canada.
 We are a major player in the craft alcohol and beverage business through SW Brewing Company, LLC (“SweetWater”), the 10th largest craft brewery in the United States according to the Brewers Association.  Founded in 1997, SweetWater has broad consumer appeal and has established strong distribution across the United States.  From its state-of-the-art brewery in Atlanta, Georgia and Colorado, SweetWater produces a balanced variety of year-round and seasonal specialty craft brews, under the SweetWater brands and recent additions, Green Flash and Alpine. 
 On December 7, 2021, the Company acquired all the membership interests in Double Diamond Distillery LLC (d/b/a Breckenridge Distillery). Founded in 2008, Breckenridge Distillery started off as a small craft spirits brand in Breckenridge Colorado but has since grown its award-winning bourbon whiskey collection and innovative craft spirits portfolio to be distributed in all 50 states in addition to owning two tasting rooms/retail shops, and a world class restaurant. 
 Our experienced leadership team provides a strong foundation to accelerate our growth. Our management team is complemented by experienced operators, cannabis industry experts, and extraction specialists, all of whom apply the latest scientific knowledge and technology to deliver quality-controlled, rigorously tested cannabis products on a large scale. 
 Our Strategy and Outlook 
 As a leading global cannabis-lifestyle and consumer packaged goods company, we are setting the standard for brand development, product quality, innovation and industrial scale cultivation for the production of cannabis grown in environmentally responsible conditions.  We believe that we possess the strategic footprint and operational scale necessary to compete more effectively in today’s consolidating cannabis market with a strong, flexible balance sheet, strong cash balance, and access to capital, which we believe gives us the ability to accelerate growth and deliver long-term sustainable value for stockholders.  
 Our overall strategy is to leverage this scale and footprint, together with our expertise and capabilities to drive market share, achieve industry-leading, profitable growth and build sustainable, long-term shareholder value in each of the four pillars of our business – medical cannabis, adult-use cannabis, beverage alcohol and wellness. In order to ensure long-term sustainable growth, we continue to focus on leveraging consumer insights, drive category

management leadership and assess growth opportunities, including the introduction of our product into new geographies, new innovation and strategic partnerships. In addition, we are relentlessly focused on managing our cost of goods and expenses in order to maintain our strong financial position.  
  To achieve our vision of building the leading global cannabis-lifestyle and consumer packaged goods company that is changing people’s lives for the better – one person at a time – by inspiring and empowering the worldwide community to live their very best life, we will focus on the following strategies:
  
• | Build global brands that lead, legitimize and define the future within each of our pillars. As the markets where cannabis is legal today continue to grow and develop and as cannabis legalizes in more countries around the world, we see unique opportunities to introduce, market and distribute our broad portfolio of differentiated brands, that will appeal to a diverse base of patients and consumers. We believe we are well positioned to develop leading global brands and drive sustainable growth.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop innovative products and form factors that change the way the world consumes cannabis. Across our pillars, we plan to continue to develop innovative products that possess the most consumer demand and are truly differentiated from our competitors, while optimizing our production capabilities. We will continue to invest in innovation in order to continue to provide our patients and consumers with a differentiated portfolio of products that exceeds their expectations and meets their needs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grow and leverage our investment in craft beer, spirits and hemp-based food. Within the U.S., our strategic acquisitions of our beverage alcohol are the cornerstone of our longer-term U.S. strategy and an important step towards achieving our vision to change people's lives for the better by inspiring and empowering the worldwide community to live their very best life. In addition to acquiring strong brands and profitable businesses, our strategic investments in beverage alcohol and food in the U.S. provides us with a platform and infrastructure within the U.S. to enable us to access the U.S. market more quickly in the event of federal legalization. In advance of federal legalization, we are focused on leading the craft beer segment, including growing our SweetWater, Alpine and Green Flash brands by expanding our distribution footprint into new territories, focusing on new product development and innovation that delights our consumers and building brand awareness of, and equity in, our existing adult-use cannabis brands in the U.S. ahead of federal legalization of cannabis by leveraging the SweetWater manufacturing and distribution infrastructure. We have also diversified our presence in the beverage alcohol space through the purchase of Breckenridge, known for its award-winning bourbon whiskey collection and innovative craft spirits portfolio. We seek to drive growth in our Manitoba Harvest brand and other hemp-based food and ingredients products by leveraging our consumer insights and consumer marketing activities, new product development as well as educating the consumer on the benefits from hemp-based foods. In the event of federal legalization in the U.S., we expect to be well-positioned to compete in the U.S. cannabis market given our existing strong brands and distribution system in addition to our track record of growth in consumer-packaged goods and cannabis products. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand the availability of pure, precise, and predictable medical cannabis products for patients around the world. Since 2014, we have seen an increase in the demand for medical cannabis from both patients, doctors and governments in conjunction with a shift in the medical community, which is increasingly recognizing medical cannabis as a viable option for the treatment of patients suffering from a variety of health conditions. We area focused on driving accessibility to high-quality medical cannabis that is accessible to all. Internationally, we have made significant investments in our operations within Europe and we are well-positioned to pursue international growth opportunities with our strong medical cannabis brands, distribution network in Germany with CC Pharma, and end-to-end European Union Good Manufacturing Practices (“EU-GMP”) supply chain, which includes EU-GMP production facilities in Portugal and Germany. We intend to continue to maximize the utilization of our existing assets and investments in connection with the development and execution of our international growth plans, while leveraging our cannabis expertise and well-established medical brands. Through our well positioned cultivation facilities in Portugal and Germany, we intend to fuel the demand for our EU GMP certified medical grade cannabis internationally. By building on this foundation, we strive to maintain our leadership position in the international cannabis industry.

We also have a strong, flexible balance sheet, cash balance and access to capital, which we believe will give us the ability to accelerate growth and deliver long-term sustainable value for our stockholders.

 Distribution 
 Canadian Adult-use Market
 Under the Canadian legislative regime, provincial, territorial and municipal governments have the authority to prescribe regulations regarding retail and distribution of adult-use cannabis. As such, the distribution model for adult-use cannabis is prescribed by provincial regulations and differs from province to province. Some provinces utilize government run retailers, while others utilize government-licensed private retailers, and some a combination of the two. All of our adult-use sales are conducted according to the applicable provincial and territorial legislation and through applicable local agencies. 
 Through our subsidiaries, Aphria and High Park Holdings Ltd. (“High Park”), we maintain supply agreements for adult-use cannabis with all the provinces and territories in Canada. 
 Tilray is party to a distribution agreement with Great North Distributors to provide sales force and wholesale/retail channel expertise required to efficiently distribute our adult-use products through each of the provincial/territorial cannabis control agencies, excluding Quebec. We also engage Rose LifeSciences Ltd. as our sale agent exclusively for the Province of Quebec, representing our entire brand portfolio.

Wholesale
 In Canada, we are authorized to sell wholesale bulk and finished cannabis products to other licensees under the Cannabis Regulations. The bulk wholesale sales and distribution channel requires minimal selling, administrative, and fulfillment costs. Our focus on the right strain assortment, quality of flower, extraction capabilities and processing, enables us to drive wholesale channel opportunities for revenue growth. 
 Changes in the Canadian market continue to result in more competitors moving towards an asset light model through the rationalization of cultivation facilities. As this transition occurs, the Company anticipates demand for its saleable flower to increase, providing new opportunities in the wholesale channel.   
 We also intend to expand our capabilities outside of saleable flower, as our quality of extraction processes continue to grow into new categories including the latest in cannabis 3.0 products. We plan to be selective in choosing partners, with the intent to secure supply agreements to further optimize and drive efficiency within our supply chain and operations.  While we intend to pursue wholesale sales channels as part of our growth strategies in Canada, these sales will continue to be used to aid in balancing inventory levels. 
 Wellness Sales and Distribution
 Our wellness sales consist of hemp seed and other hemp-based food products, which are sold to retailers, wholesalers, and direct to consumers. We are a leading provider of hemp seeds and related food products that are sold in over 17,000 retail locations in the United States and Canada and available globally in 19 countries. 
Beverage Alcohol Sales and Distribution
 In the U.S., our craft beer, including SweetWater, Alpine and Green Flash, are distributed under a three-tier model utilized for beverage alcohol. Distribution points include approximately 29,000 off-premises retail locations ranging from independent bottle shops to national chains. SweetWater’s significant on-premises business allows consumers to enjoy its varietals in more than 10,000 restaurants and bars. Further, in addition to its traditional distribution footprint, SweetWater Elevated HAZY IPA is served on all Delta Air Lines flights nationwide plus internationally, totaling more than 50 countries across six continents which have served to extend SweetWater’s brand reach on both a national and international level. The Company supplements this distribution with Delta Air Lines through a kiosk in Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport and secured access to distribute through an on-premises location at the Denver International Airport. SweetWater is also available in Canada through limited distribution within Ontario and Quebec. In addition, our craft spirit brands from Breckenridge are distributed in all 50-states, and in two on-premises tasting and retail store locations. Breckenridge is also distributed in 8 different countries, including Canada, Germany, UK, Hong Kong, Macau, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, with the intention of further expanding our international distribution. 
Regulatory Environment 
 Canadian Medical and Adult-Use 
 Medical and adult-use cannabis in Canada is regulated under the federal Cannabis Act (Canada) (the “Cannabis Act”) and the Cannabis Regulations (“CR”) promulgated under the Cannabis Act. Both the Cannabis Act and CR came into force in October 2018, superseding earlier legislation that only permitted commercial distribution and home cultivation of medical cannabis. The following are the highlights of the current federal legislation:

• | a federal license is required for companies to cultivate, process and sell cannabis for medical or non-medical purposes. Health Canada, a federal government entity, is the oversight and regulatory body for cannabis licenses in Canada;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | allows individuals to purchase, possess and cultivate limited amounts of cannabis for medical purposes and, for individuals over the age of 18 years, for adult-use recreational purposes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enables the provinces and territories to regulate other aspects associated with recreational adult-use. In particular, each province or territory may adopt its own laws governing the distribution, sale and consumption of cannabis and cannabis accessory products, and those laws may set lower maximum permitted quantities for individuals and higher age requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
13


 
• | promotion, packaging and labelling of cannabis is strictly regulated. For example, promotion is largely restricted to the place of sale and age-gated environments (i.e., environments with verification measures in place to restrict access to persons of legal age). Promotions that appeal to underage individuals are prohibited;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | since the current federal regime came into force on October 17, 2018, certain classes of cannabis, including dried cannabis and oils, have been permitted for sale into the medical and adult-use markets;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | following amendments to the CR that came into force on October 17, 2019 (often referred to as Cannabis 2.0 regulations), other non-combustible form-factors, including edibles, topicals, and extracts (both ingested and inhaled), are permitted in the medical and adult-use markets;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | export is restricted to medical cannabis, cannabis for scientific purposes, and industrial hemp; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sale of medical cannabis occurs on a direct-to-patient basis from a federally licensed provider, while sale of adult-use cannabis occurs through retail-distribution models established by provincial and territorial governments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All provincial and territorial governments have, to varying degrees, enacted regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of recreational adult-use cannabis within their jurisdiction, including minimum age requirements. The retail-distribution models for adult-use cannabis varies nationwide:
  
• | Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island adopted a government-run model for retail and distribution;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, and Newfoundland and Labrador adopted a hybrid model with some aspects, including distribution and online retail being government-run while allowing for private licensed retail stores;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Manitoba and Saskatchewan adopted a private model, with privately-run retail stores and online sales, with distribution in Manitoba managed by the provincial government;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the three northern territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut adopted a model that mirrors their government-run liquor distribution model.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the cannabis industry is subject to substantial federal and provincial excise taxes. Excise taxes may be increased in the future by the federal or any provincial government or both. 
 
United States Regulation of Hemp-Based CBD
 
Hemp products are subject to state and federal regulation in respect to the production, distribution and sale of products intended for human ingestion or topical application. Hemp is categorized as Cannabis sativa L., a subspecies of the cannabis genus. Numerous unique, chemical compounds are extractable from Hemp, including CBD. Hemp, as defined in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the “2018 Farm Bill”), is distinguishable from marijuana, which also comes from the Cannabis sativa L. subspecies, by its absence of more than trace amounts (0.3% or less) of the psychoactive compound THC.  
 
The 2018 Farm Bill preserves the authority and jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), under the Food Drug & Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”), to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and sale of food, drugs, dietary supplements, and cosmetics, including products that contain Hemp extracts and derivatives, such as CBD. As a result, the FD&C Act will continue to apply to Hemp-derived food, drugs, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and devices introduced, or prepared for introduction, into interstate commerce. As a producer and marketer of Hemp-derived products, the Company must comply with the FDA regulations applicable to manufacturing and marketing of certain products, including food, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. 
 
As a result of the 2018 Farm Bill, federal law dictates that CBD derived from Hemp is not a controlled substance; however, CBD derived from Hemp may still be considered a controlled substance under applicable state law. Individual states take varying approaches to regulating the production and sale of Hemp and Hemp-derived CBD. Some states explicitly authorize and regulate the production and sale of Hemp-derived CBD or otherwise provide legal protection for authorized individuals to engage in commercial Hemp activities. Other states, however, maintain drug laws that do not distinguish between marijuana and Hemp and/or Hemp-derived CBD which results in Hemp being classified as a controlled substance under certain state laws.

European Union Medical Use 
 While each country in the European Union (“EU”) has its own laws and regulations, many common practices are being adopted relative to the developing and growing medical cannabis market. For example, to ensure quality and safe products for patients, many EU countries only permit the import and sale of medical cannabis from EU-GMP certified manufacturers. 
 The EU requires adherence to EU-GMP standards for the manufacture of active substances and medicinal products, including cannabis products. The EU system for certification of GMP allows a Competent Authority of any EU member state to conduct inspections of manufacturing sites and, if the strict EU-GMP standards are met, to issue a certificate of EU-GMP compliance that is also accepted in other EU member countries. 
 Craft Brewing in the United States
 The alcoholic beverage industry in the United States is regulated by federal, state and local governments. These regulations govern the production, sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages, including permitting, licensing, marketing and advertising. To operate their production facilities, SweetWater and Breckenridge must obtain and maintain numerous permits, licenses and approvals from various governmental agencies, including but not limited to, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (the “TTB”), the FDA, state alcohol regulatory agencies and state and federal environmental agencies. Our brewery operations are subject to audit and inspection by the TTB at any time. 
 In addition, the alcohol industry is subject to substantial federal and state excise taxes.  Excise taxes may be increased in the future by the federal government or any state government or both. In the past, increases in excise taxes on alcoholic beverages have been considered in connection with various governmental budget-balancing or funding proposals.
 
Environmental Regulation
 Our cannabis, brewing and spirits operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and local permitting requirements and agreements regarding, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation. They also set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. In addition, any new products introduced by us are subject to a comprehensive environmental assessment by an independent third-party expert, including an assessment of how such products may create environmental risks. 
 While we have no reason to believe the operation of our facilities violates any such regulation or requirement, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, environmental regulation is evolving in a manner which may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. If a violation were to occur, or if environmental regulations were to become more stringent in the future, we could be adversely affected.
 Competitive Conditions 
 Cannabis Market
 We continue to face intense competition from the illicit market as well as other companies, some of which may have longer operating histories and more financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience. With potential consolidation in the cannabis industry, we could face increased competition by larger and better financed competitors.
 Growers of cannabis and retailers operating in the illicit market continue to hold significant market share in Canada and are effectively competitors to our business.  Illicit market participants divert customers away through product offering, price point, anonymity and convenience. 
 Outdoor cultivation also significantly reduces the barrier to entry by reducing the start-up capital required for new entrants in the cannabis industry. It may also ultimately lower prices as capital expenditure requirements related to growing outside are typically much lower than those associated with indoor growing. Further, the licensed outdoor 
 
15


cultivation capacity is extremely large. While outdoor cultivation is almost exclusively extraction grade, its presence in the market will have a negative effect on pricing of extraction grade wholesale cannabis.
 As of July 22, 2022, Health Canada has issued approximately 870 active licenses to cannabis cultivators, processors and sellers. Health Canada licenses are limited to individual properties. As such, if a licensed producer seeks to commence production at a new site, it must apply to Health Canada for a new license. As of May 31, 2022, roughly 3,000 authorized retail cannabis stores have opened across Canada. As demand for legal cannabis increases and the number of authorized retail distribution points increases, we believe new competitors are likely to enter the Canadian cannabis market. Nevertheless, we believe our brand recognition combined with the quality, consistency, and variety of cannabis products we offer will allow us to maintain a prominent position in the Canadian adult use and medical markets.
 Competition is also based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, as well as convenience and service. 
 Internationally, cannabis companies are limited to those countries which have legalized aspects of the cultivation, distribution, sale or use of cannabis. We focused on developing assets in certain strategic international jurisdictions, which maintain legalized aspects of the cannabis business. We possess operational hubs in continents with significant growth opportunities and the production capability and distribution network to distribute such products throughout the region served by each hub. The barrier to entry for competitors in these jurisdictions is significantly influenced by the national regulatory landscape with respect to cannabis and the economic climate subsisting in each region. 
 We expect more countries to pass regulation allowing for the use of medical and/or recreational cannabis. While expansion of the global cannabis market will provide more opportunities to grow our international business, we also expect to experience increased global competition.
 Craft Brewing and Craft Distillery Markets
 Through SweetWater and Breckenridge, we compete in the craft brewing and distillery markets, respectively, as well as in the much larger alcohol beverage market, which encompasses domestic and imported beers, flavored alcohol beverages, spirits, wine, hard ciders and hard seltzers. With the proliferation of participants and offerings in the wider alcohol beverage market and within the craft beer and craft spirits segments, we face significant competition. There have also been numerous acquisitions and investments in craft brewers by larger breweries and private equity and other investors, which further intensified competition within the craft beer market. 
 While the craft beer and craft spirits markets are highly competitive, we believe that we possess certain competitive advantages. Our unique portfolio combines an award-winning lineup of craft beers and craft spirits with a unique portfolio of brands closely aligned with a cannabis lifestyle, and supported by state-of-the-art breweries and distilleries and strong distribution across the United States. Additionally, as domestic breweries and distillery, we maintain certain competitive advantages over imported beers and spirits, such as lower transportation costs, a lack of import charges and superior product freshness.
Seasonality
 SweetWater’s sales of craft beer and Breckenridge’s sales of craft spirits generally reflect a degree of seasonality, with comparatively higher sales in the summer and the winter holiday season. Typically, the demand for cannabis and hemp-based products is fairly consistent throughout the calendar year. Moreover, the impact of COVID-19 on customer behavior and access to our products may cause temporary seasonal fluctuations or changes to our businesses. Therefore, the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results to be achieved for the full year.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of May 31, 2022, we have approximately 1,800 employees worldwide. We consider relations with our employees to be good and have never experienced work stoppages. Aside from Portugal, none of our employees are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining agreements. As is common for most companies 
 
16


doing business in Portugal, we are subject to a government-mandated collective bargaining agreement which grants employees nominal additional benefits beyond those required by the local labor code.
 We are committed to establishing a leadership team and corporate culture that promotes inclusion and diversity as we continue to grow our business and expand our footprint. Diversity and inclusion is a priority for our company, and we seek out talented people from a variety of backgrounds to staff our teams in all our markets.  Aligned with our mission and values, this strategy will shape our future as a leading employer.
 Our vision and purpose unite, inform and inspire our employees to apply their talents to make a positive difference.  We foster a collaborative and dynamic work environment providing all employees with the opportunity to work cross-functionally and easily gain exposure to other team’s diverse opinions and perspectives. We strive for every employee to reach their full potential and grow with Tilray.
