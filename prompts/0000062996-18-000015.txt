Item 1. | Business.

Masco Corporation is a global leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of branded home improvement and building products. Our portfolio of industry-leading brands includes BEHR® paint; DELTA® and HANSGROHE® faucets and bath and shower fixtures; KRAFTMAID® and MERILLAT® cabinets; MILGARD® windows and doors; and HOT SPRING® spas. We leverage our powerful brands across product categories, sales channels and geographies to create value for our customers and shareholders.
We believe that our solid results of operations and financial position for 2017 resulted from our continued focus on our three strategic pillars: driving the full potential of our core businesses, leveraging opportunities across our businesses, and actively managing our portfolio. 
To drive the full potential of our core businesses during 2017, we continued to pursue sales growth opportunities by introducing new products, enhancing services and penetrating adjacent markets. In addition, we continued to reduce costs and capitalize on synergies across our businesses with standardized operating tools, cost saving initiatives and the implementation of lean principles and process improvements in many areas, including production and functional support processes. As a result, we grew both our top and bottom lines.
We also continued to leverage the collective strength of our enterprise, the second pillar of our strategy. We provided new assignments to selected leaders across our business units to further develop talent and facilitate operational improvements. We continued to realize supply chain efficiencies through strategic sourcing and to share best practices across all of our functional departments to enhance productivity. We believe this contributed to our results of operations improving as compared to the prior year.
Additionally, we continued to actively manage our portfolio, the third pillar of our strategy, and remain committed to making selective acquisitions in attractive end markets. During 2017, we acquired a U.S. plastics processor and manufacturer of water handling systems in our Plumbing Products segment and signed a definitive agreement to acquire The L.D. Kichler Co., a leader in decorative residential and light commercial lighting products, ceiling fans and LED lighting systems, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. We also divested our U.S. fastener and tool business and our U.K. manufacturer of kitchen and bathroom furniture business. In addition, we repurchased over 9 million shares of our common stock and increased our quarterly dividend by 5 percent, which further enhanced value for our shareholders. 
We believe that the actions we have taken over the last few years, combined with the Masco Operating System, our methodology to drive growth and productivity, have positioned us to further enhance shareholder value through strong and consistent growth.  We will continue to actively manage our portfolio, identify growth opportunities in key industries and create new products that differentiate us in the marketplace by combining design and innovation. By focusing on our disciplined execution of our strategy, we believe that our positive momentum will continue.

All of our operating segments, except the Plumbing Products segment, normally experience stronger sales during the second and third calendar quarters, corresponding with the peak season for repair and remodel activity and new home construction.
Plumbing Products
The businesses in our Plumbing Products segment sell a wide variety of products that are manufactured or sourced by us. 

• | The majority of our faucet, sink, bathing and showering products are sold in North America and Europe under the brand names DELTA®, BRIZO®, PEERLESS®, HANSGROHE®, AXOR®, GINGER®, NEWPORT BRASS®, BRASSTECH® and WALTEC®. Our BRISTAN™ and HERITAGE™ products are sold primarily in the United Kingdom. These plumbing products include faucets, showerheads, handheld showers, valves, bath hardware and accessories, bathing units, shower enclosures and toilets. We sell these products to home center and online retailers and to wholesalers and distributors that, in turn, sell them to plumbers, building contractors, remodelers, smaller retailers and consumers.


• | We manufacture acrylic tubs, bath and shower enclosure units, and shower trays. Our DELTA, PEERLESS and MIROLIN® products are sold primarily to home center retailers in North America. Our MIROLIN products are also sold to wholesalers and distributors in Canada. Our HÜPPE® shower enclosures and shower trays are sold through wholesale channels primarily in Europe.


• | Our spas and exercise pools and systems are manufactured and sold under our HOT SPRING®, CALDERA®, FREEFLOW SPAS®, FANTASY SPAS® and ENDLESS POOLS® brands, as well as under other trademarks. Our spa products and exercise pools are sold worldwide to independent specialty retailers and distributors and to online mass merchant retailers. Certain exercise pools are also available on a consumer-direct basis in North America and Europe, while our fitness systems are sold through independent specialty retailers as well as on a consumer-direct basis.


• | Also included in our Plumbing Products segment are brass, copper and composite plumbing system components and other non-decorative plumbing products that are sold to plumbing, heating and hardware wholesalers, home center and e-commerce retailers, hardware stores, building supply outlets and other mass merchandisers. These products are marketed primarily in North America under our BRASSCRAFT®, PLUMB SHOP®, COBRA®, COBRA PRO™, and MASTER PLUMBER® brands and are also sold under private label.

We believe that our plumbing products are among the leaders in sales in North America and Europe. Competitors of the majority of our products in this segment include Lixil Group Corporation’s American Standard Brands and Grohe products, Kohler Co., Fortune Brands Home & Security Inc.'s Moen, Rohl and Riobel brands and Spectrum Brands Holdings, LLC’s Pfister faucets. Competitors of our spas and exercise pools and systems include Jacuzzi, Master Spas and Dynasty Spas. Foreign manufacturers competing with us are located primarily in Germany and China. We face significant competition from private label products. Many of the faucet and showering products with which our products compete are manufactured by foreign manufacturers that are putting downward pressure on price. The businesses in

our Plumbing Products segment manufacture products in North America, Europe and Asia and source products from Asia and other regions. Competition for our plumbing products is based largely on brand reputation, product features and innovation, product quality, customer service, breadth of product offering and price.
Many of our plumbing products contain brass, the major components of which are copper and zinc. We have multiple sources, both domestic and foreign, for the raw materials used in this segment, and sufficient raw materials have been available for our needs. We have encountered price volatility for brass, brass components and any components containing copper and zinc. To help reduce the impact of this volatility, from time to time we may enter into long-term agreements with certain significant suppliers or, occasionally, use derivative instruments.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we acquired Mercury Plastics, Inc. ("Mercury"), a U.S. plastics processor and manufacturer of water handling systems. This acquisition enhances our ability to develop faucet technology and provides continuity of supply of quality faucet components.
Decorative Architectural Products
We produce architectural coatings, including paints, primers, specialty paints, stains and waterproofing products. These products are sold in North America, South America and China under the brand names BEHR®, KILZ® and other trademarks to “do‑it‑yourself” and professional customers through home center retailers and other retailers. Net sales of architectural coatings comprised approximately 25 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our BEHR products are sold through The Home Depot, our largest customer overall, as well as this segment’s largest customer. The loss of this segment’s sales to The Home Depot would have a material adverse effect on this segment’s business and on our consolidated business as a whole.
Our competitors in this segment include large national and international brands such as Benjamin Moore, Glidden, Olympic, PPG, Sherwin‑Williams, Valspar and Zinsser, as well as many regional and other national brands. We believe that brand reputation is an important factor in consumer selection, and that competition in this industry is also based largely on product features and innovation, product quality, customer service and price. 
Titanium dioxide is a major ingredient in the manufacture of architectural coatings. The price for titanium dioxide can fluctuate as a result of global supply and demand dynamics and production capacity limitations, which can have a material impact on our costs and results of operations in this segment. Natural gas derivatives and acrylic resins derived from crude oil are also used in the manufacture of architectural coatings. Significant price fluctuations in either natural gas derivatives or crude oil can also impact our costs in this segment. We have agreements with certain significant suppliers for this segment that are intended to help assure continued supply.
Our Decorative Architectural Products segment also includes branded cabinet, door and window hardware, functional hardware, glass shower doors, wall plates, hook and rail products, and picture hanging accessories, which are manufactured for us and sold to home center retailers, mass retailers, e-commerce retailers, other specialty retailers, original equipment manufacturers and wholesalers. These products are sold under the LIBERTY®, BRAINERD® and other trademarks, and our key competitors in North America include Amerock, Top Knobs, Richelieu and private label brands. Decorative bath hardware, shower accessories, and shower doors are sold under the brand names DELTA® and FRANKLIN BRASS® to wholesalers, home center retailers, mass retailers and other specialty retailers. Competitors for these products include Moen, Kohler, Gatco and private label brands.
Cabinetry Products
In North America, we manufacture and sell semi-custom, stock and value‑priced assembled cabinetry for kitchen, bath, storage, home office and home entertainment applications in a broad range of styles and price points to address consumer preferences. Our KRAFTMAID® and CARDELL® products are sold primarily to dealers and home center retailers, and our MERILLAT® and QUALITY CABINETS™ products are sold primarily to dealers and homebuilders for both home improvement and new home construction. Cabinet sales are significantly affected by levels of activity in both retail consumer spending and new home construction, particularly spending for major kitchen and bathroom renovation projects. A significant portion of our cabinetry sales for home improvement projects are made through home center retailers.

The cabinet manufacturing industry in the United States includes several large companies and numerous local and regional businesses with whom we compete. We believe that competition in this industry is based largely on product features and selection, product quality, and price. Our competitors in this segment include American Woodmark Corporation, Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. and Elkay.
The raw materials used in this segment are primarily hardwood lumber, plywood and particleboard, and are available from multiple sources, both domestic and foreign. Some of the materials we import may be subject to customs duties.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we divested Moores Furniture Group Limited ("Moores"), a manufacturer of kitchen and bathroom furniture in the United Kingdom. 
Windows and Other Specialty Products
We manufacture and sell vinyl, fiberglass and aluminum windows and patio doors, which are sold under the MILGARD® brand name for home improvement and new home construction, principally in the western United States. MILGARD products are sold primarily through dealers and, to a lesser extent, directly to production homebuilders and through lumber yards and home center retailers. Our North American competitors for these products include national brands, such as Jeld‑Wen, Marvin, Pella, Ply Gem and Andersen, and numerous regional brands.
In the United Kingdom, we manufacture and sell vinyl windows, composite and panel doors, related products and components under several brand names, including DURAFLEX™, GRIFFIN™, PREMIER™ and EVOLUTION™. Sales are primarily through dealers and wholesalers to the repair and remodeling markets, although our DURAFLEX products are also sold to other window fabricators. United Kingdom competitors include many small and mid‑sized firms and a few large, vertically integrated competitors.
In addition to price, we believe that brand reputation is an important factor in consumer selection and that competition in this industry in both the domestic and international markets is based largely on product quality, innovative products and customer and warranty services.
The raw materials used in this segment are available from multiple sources.
In the second quarter of 2017, we divested Arrow Fastener Co., LLC ("Arrow"), a manufacturer and distributor of fastening tools.
Additional Information
Intellectual Property
We hold numerous U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications, licenses, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing processes. We view our trademarks and other intellectual property rights as important, but do not believe that there is any reasonable likelihood of a loss of such rights that would have a material adverse effect on our present business as a whole.
Environmental Laws and Regulations Affecting Our Business
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign government regulations regarding the protection of the environment, and we have certain responsibilities for environmental remediation. We monitor applicable laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and incur ongoing expense relating to compliance. Compliance with these laws and regulations may affect our product and production costs. 

• | Many products in our Plumbing Products segment are subject to restrictions on the amount of certain materials and chemicals, including lead and mercury, that can be in the product, and on water flow rates.


• | Our Decorative Architectural Products segment is subject to requirements relating to the emission of volatile organic compounds, which has required us to reformulate paint products and may require further reformulation in the future.


• | Our Cabinetry Products segment is also subject to requirements relating to the emission of volatile organic compounds, which may impact our sourcing of particleboard and may require us to install special equipment in manufacturing facilities.

We do not expect that compliance with the federal, state and local regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, will result in material capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position or results of operations and financial position.
Backlog
We do not consider backlog orders to be material in any of our segments.
Employees
At December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 26,000 people. We have generally experienced satisfactory relations with our employees.
