ITEM 1. BUSINESS
It is the Companys belief that the United States, along with most parts of the world are in the very early stages of a significant spike in the growth curve for less-lethal products. Most law enforcement agencies do not have a proper working knowledge of a less-lethal program in place. Rather they are using an assortment of less-lethal devices out of necessity for varying degrees of effectiveness with little coordination or approved tactical plans for their deployment. Law enforcement budget constraints usually play a role in this behavior. It is for this reason that unintended deaths of unarmed suspects at the hands of police departments throughout the country (and in fact throughout the world) continue to happen. 
 With a rise in social and civil unrest both here and abroad and with more and more of these incidents being caught on video and posted on social media, the pressure on law enforcement and governments to find reasonable and effective alternatives to lethal force is mounting daily. As a result, it is managements opinion that the less-lethal market will be one of the faster growing segment in the law enforcement, correctional services, crowd control and security services markets over the next decade. 
 Less-lethal weapons include a wide variety of products designed to disorient, slow down and stop would be assailants, rioters and other malfeasants. In the Companys opinion, the less-lethal weapon that is growing the fastest in popularity and adoption is the 40mm launcher along with the various less-lethal munitions that can be fired from these launchers. These munitions include both impact rounds designed to stop an individual without causing permanent injury to payload rounds carrying a variety of powders and liquids including tear gas, pepper spray, DNA marking liquids, mal-odorants and other marking liquids and powders designed to identify instigators in a riot situation. 
 Historically, these munitions were fired from 37mm launchers, however, the industry has been moving to 40mm launchers due to the fact that the 40mm launcher barrel is rifled (while the 37mm is a smooth bore barrel less accurate munition) which allows the operator to more accurately fire the rounds at distances in excess of 100. This makes the 40mm launcher an effective tool in a wide range of situations.
 Additional less lethal munitions include 12 gauge and .68 caliber impact and chemical irritant projectiles. The 12 gauge has been a long-standing tool for law enforcement and correctional services, as almost all domestic patrol cars carry a shotgun to fire the 12 gauge munitions when required. The .68 caliber projectiles are fired from an air gun system for close range incidents where impact force is not the main objective with a subject, but chemical irritant munitions are necessary to stop an assailant.

Business
 History 
 Security Devices International Inc. (the Company or the Corporation) was incorporated on March 1, 2005. The Company began as a research and development company focused on the development of 40mm less-lethal ammunition. 
 The Company initiated with the development of a Wireless Electric Projectile (the WEP), named the Lektrox. The Company hired a ballistics engineering firm to collaborate in the development of the WEP. 
 Commencing in December 2008, the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) of the US Department of Defense, an organization responsible for the development and coordination of non-lethal weapons activities within the United States, tested the WEP through its evaluation facility at Penn State University. An executive summary was released to the Company indicating a positive outcome.
 In the fall of 2010, the Company underwent a change in the board of directors and management. This precipitated a change in the direction of the company as development of the WEP was discontinued and the company shifted its focus to a new product  the 40mm Blunt Impact Projectile (BIP). The Company concluded that the cost and time required to complete development and testing of the BIP were significantly less than that required to complete development and testing of the WEP. The goal was to develop a product that it could bring to market more quickly. The Company was able to exploit some of the patent pending technology of the WEP into the BIP. In 2011, the Company moved its engineering, intellectual property and production facilities to the Operator (the BIP Manufacturer) of an injection molding facility outside of Boston, Massachusetts. 
 The Blunt Impact Projectile (BIP)  A Transformative Technology 
 When the less-lethal industry was dominated by the 37mm launcher, a number of less-lethal companies developed impact munition rounds designed to stop an assailant. These rounds were nothing more than a piece of plastic, wood baton, rubber baton, or a piece of plastic with a piece of sponge rubber or foam rubber affixed to the head of the round.
 There were several problems with these 37mm rounds. First, they were inaccurate due to the lack of barrel rifling. Since most SWAT teams carry single shot launchers, a round that cannot be shot accurately is of little value. Second, because of their lightweight, they did not have much stopping power. Suspects that were committed would often shake off a direct hit. Finally, the rounds would bounce off walls or other hard surfaces which made them dangerous to use in confined areas such as a jail cell. Numerous corrections officers have been hurt by impact rounds ricocheting off of jail cell walls.
 Security Devices International solved all three issues with the development of its Blunt Impact Projectile (BIP). The BIP was developed as an outgrowth of a research and development project to create a conductive electric device bullet (project name WEP  Wireless Electric Projectile). 
 In order to ensure that the projectile did not injure the targeted individual, SDI needed to develop a way to cushion the impact of the round upon contact with the target. The solution was a collapsible head that compressed upon impact. (See below). When it became clear that SDI did not have sufficient funds to complete development of the WEP, it was decided to use the collapsible head design to create an impact round. The hope was that with this new, state-of-the-art impact round, SDI could generate enough profitability that it would be able to complete development of the WEP.
 2 


This collapsible head technology allowed SDI to build a heavier projectile that did not require a rubber or foam tip. This meant that it could take advantage of the rifling of the 40mm launcher. This made the BIP by far the most accurate round on the market in comparison to previous 37mm projectiles. The target for an impact round is to be a large muscle group such as the thigh muscle. 
 The gel collapsible head of the BIP spreads out upon impact, dispersing the energy over a larger area thus reducing blunt trauma to the subject. This allows the BIP round to be fired at close range on a target. 
 The Company believes that its patented collapsible head technology will transform the industry as law enforcement agencies recognize the tactical advantages of a less-lethal weapon that can be safely, accurately and effectively deployed at close range distances between 10 to 100 feet. SDI has been in discussions several industry players about licensing SDIs technology. 
 Early in 2011 the Company focused its attention on a new 40mm product, the blunt impact projectile (BIP), and discontinued further development work on the WEP. 
 2012
 In June 2012, the Company contracted CRT Less Lethal Inc. (CRT) to test the BIP. Based on data obtained from the three-stage evaluation, the BIP passed the CRT testing protocol for accuracy, consistency, relative safety and effectiveness.
 In July 2012, the Company signed a five-year development, supply and manufacturing agreement with a subcontractor to Manufacture the BIP. 
 In November 2012, the Company obtained a United States Department of Transportation number (DOT) required in order for the Company to ship BIP rounds.
 3 

In 2012, the Company began the development of six new less-lethal ammunition rounds. These new rounds will be a modified version of the BIP, four of which carry a payload, including; BIP MP (temporary powder-based marking agent), BIP ML (semi-permanent liquid marking agent), BIP OC (Oleoresin Capsicum - a pepper spray powder), BIP CS (tear gas powder), BIP MO (malodorant liquid), and the BIP TR (training round). 
 2013
 The Company moved its full manufacturing and supply chain operations to the BIP manufacturer, a supply manufacturing and engineering company, in the Boston, MA area. 
 The Company undertook an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in January and became a public reporting issuer on the TSX-Venture Exchange in September 2013. 
 2014
 SDI began another globally recognized testing protocol with a military agency called HECOE (The Human Effects Centre of Excellence). This world-renowned agency is located in the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), in partnership with the US Joint Non-lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD). This group conducts research to assist Non-lethal Weapon (NLW) Program Managers across the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) in assessing effectiveness and risks of NLWs. The positive conclusion of this testing allows the DOD to purchase SDI rounds.
 April - SDI appointed Keith Morrison to the board of directors as non-executive Chairman.
 May - SDIs BIP rounds were used at the Mock Prison Riot in West Virginia. Law enforcement and correctional services officers provided feedback on new technologies (such as SDIs products) to assist in the effectiveness of their jobs. 
 August - The Company completed the issuance of 1,549 convertible unsecured debentures (Unsecured Debentures) at $1,000 per debenture for gross proceeds of $1,549,000 (the Private Placement).
 October - SDI. announced that the Company and a division of Abrams Airborne Manufacturing Inc. (AAMI), namely Milkor USA (MUSA), have agreed to partner for a joint cross-selling / marketing initiative. 
 November - The Company named Karim Kanji to the board of directors as an independent member. 
 SDI sold their BIP products into nine new agencies during the fiscal year of 2014 including Sheriff Departments, Correctional Services, and SWAT teams in; Saskatoon, SK, Watertown, SD, Abbotsford, BC, Sacramento, CA, Kingston, ON, Rustburg, VA, Orlando, FL, Montreal, QC, and Bedford, VA. These agencies are additions to SDIs customer base that have adopted its 40mm less-lethal rounds.

 Through SDIs distributor (U.S. Tactical Supply GSA) the Company was able to leverage their relationship to facilitate a live-fire demonstration for the Pentagon Protection Force in Alexandria, Virginia.
 May - SDI participated in the Mock Prison Riot which takes place annually at a decommissioned penitentiary in Moundsville, West Virginia. The Mock Prison Riot is a four-day, comprehensive law enforcement and corrections tactical and technology experience, including 40,000 square feet of exhibit space, training scenarios, technology demonstrations, certification workshops, a Skills Competition, and unlimited opportunities for feedback and networking on a global scale.
 June-SDI staff attended the Ohio Tactical officers conference in June where the Company not only had a full exhibit booth set up to bring awareness to SDIs full line of less lethal 40MM products but also conducted live fire demonstrations to several agencies. These agencies had requested seeing the projectiles fired to move forward with evaluation of SDIs products for potential inclusion in their less lethal arsenal.
 July - SDI was invited to present the Companys full line of products to the New York City Police Department. Representatives of SDI attended the NYPD range and conducted in-class presentations followed by a live fire demonstration showcasing the full line on 40MM products that SDI can offer for Law Enforcement operational missions.

 On May 19, 2017 Public Works and Government Services Canada issued a Request for a Standing Offer (Solicitation #M0077-16J101/A) on behalf of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), for 40mm Blunt Impact Projectiles. SDI has submitted their bid for this standing offer in the anticipation of winning the 3-year tender (with two one year options totaling 5 years). The standing offer for the Company’s calls for 150,000 rounds for years 1 to 3, and an additional 150,000 40mm Blunt Impact Projectiles for the 2 optional years.
  Q3 FY2017 
 During the quarter, SDI agreed to extend the consulting agreement between the Company and NEIP first announced on June 20, 2016. SDI and NEIP have agreed to extend the consulting agreement that will automatically renew each quarter until either party gives notice of cancellation. For its services and subject to stock exchange approval, NEIP will be issued SDI common shares for its services on August 15, 2017 and quarterly thereafter while the consulting agreement is in effect. Payments will be prorated if the consulting agreement is terminated during any quarterly period. 
  SDI announced the signing of a multi-year agreement to provide its patented collapsible head blunt impact projectiles (BIPs) and collapsible head payload projectiles including OC (pepper spray), CS (tear gas), ML (marking liquid), MP (marking powder), MO (malodorant), IN (inert powder) and DNA (plant based DNA forensic marking rounds) to the Safariland Group (“Safariland”), headquartered in Jacksonville, FL. 
  SDI will supply BIPs and payload projectiles to Safariland for integration with Safariland's proprietary propulsion system. These new rounds will be marketed under the industry-leading Defense Technology brand name. The first shipment of rounds was made in Q3. 
  Management believes that the agreement with Safariland validates the more than five years of research and development that SDI has invested in the creation of the collapsible head 40mm round. Management further believes that by working in partnership with Safariland, together the companies can reach a far larger market for the BIP than SDI would be able to reach on its own.
  The Safariland Group is a leading global provider of a broad range of safety and survivability products designed for the public safety, military, professional and outdoor markets. The Safariland Group offers a number of recognized brand names in these markets including Safariland®, Med-Eng®, ABA®, Second Chance®, VIEVU®, Mustang Survival®, Bianchi®, Break Free®, PROTECH® Tactical, Defense Technology®, Hatch®, Monadnock®, Identicator® and NIK®.

 The Companys independent registered public accounting firm Schwartz Levitsky Feldman (SLF), resigned as the Companys auditors by letter dated November 30, 2017 for personal reasons.
 The reports of SLF on the Companys financial statements for the two most recent fiscal years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, other than a going concern qualification. During the Companys two most recent fiscal years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 and during the subsequent interim period preceding SLFs resignation, there were: (i) no disagreements with SLF on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosures or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of SLF would have caused SLF to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports, and (ii) no reportable events of the type listed in paragraphs (A) through (D) of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. SLF also has confirmed the above statements to the Companys successor independent auditor in a letter dated December 1, 2017, which can be found in the Companys December 4, 2017 Form 8-K. 
 Following the resignation of SLF, the Companys Audit Committee met on December 1, 2017 and selected UHY McGovern Hurley LLP of Toronto, Ontario. The Companys Board of Directors confirmed the appointment and nominated UHY McGovern Hurly LLP for ratification by shareholders of the Company as the Companys independent auditors in the next fiscal year ending November 30, 2017. 
 The Company is in discussions with certain individuals and entities regarding acquiring or licensing IP (Intellectual Property) that will allow SDI to expand its product range from its core law enforcement, military and corrections markets to new markets including private security and personal/home security (consumer). Given that there are over 1 million private security guards in the US (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) and over 120 million households in the US (United States Census Bureau), management believes these opportunities represent significant untapped markets for the Company. 
 The Company continues to explore relationships in key overseas markets for the manufacture and distribution of its less lethal products.

Subsequent to the first quarter of 2018 (February 28, 2018), the Company received several purchase orders valuing in excess of $100,000 for their BIP line of munitions from international customers. The orders consist of repeat business as well as new larger agencies with hundreds of officers on staff. Agencies placing these orders included parts of Canada as well as the Middle East. The new business is in line with the Company's strategy of marketing outside of the US and North America and accelerating its licensing model. 
 Operations
 The Company has restructured to reduce its overhead and operating expenses with its new e-commerce and licensing model. 
 Website Update
 SDI continues to update its website to manage its digital presence, as well as maintain its top positioning in search engines for the less-lethal industry. The e-commerce platform was launched in the fourth quarter and agencies have begun signing up to view and purchase products online. 
Products
 SDIs business is the development, manufacture and sale of less-lethal ammunition. This ammunition is used by the military, correctional services, police agencies, and private security for crowd control.
 The Company has two commercial product lines:
 
a) | The Company has developed the BIP, a blunt impact projectile which uses pain compliance to control a target. The Company has developed eight versions of the standard BIP, seven of which contain a payload and one of which is a cheaper cost, training round. A payload is an internal medium within the BIP, holding a liquid or powder substance. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b) | The Company offers a specified line of 12 gauge less lethal projectiles and irritants for law enforcement and correctional services agencies. The projectiles come in impact forms such as, rubber fins and a bean bag version. 
c) | The Company has undertaken substantial work to develop the WEP, a wireless electric projective which releases an electrical pulse that induces a muscle spasm and causes the target to fall to the ground helpless. This product is not fully complete at this time. 

Intellectual Property 
 Five patent applications, four non-provisional and one provisional, have been filed by the Company with the U.S. Patent Office. The Patents have been granted on the four non-provisional patents. The Company has also filed for a trademark for the BIP. 
 Non-Provisional (granted patents):
 (a) Less-lethal Projectile: This issued patent relates to the Companys distinctive collapsible ammunition head technology that absorbs kinetic energy of the projectile upon impact. The Corporations collapsible head is used in both the BIP and the WEP.
 (b) Electronic Circuitry for Incapacitating a Living Target: This issued patent relates to the electronic circuitry incapacitation system which forms part of the WEP. The patent describes an electronic circuit which provides an electrical incapacitation current to a living target.

(c) Less-lethal Wireless Stun Projectile System for Immobilizing a Target by Neuro-Muscular Disruption: This issued patent describes the process by which the WEP operates with its attachment system to halt a target through a neuro-muscular-disruption system.
 (d) Autonomous Operation of a Less-lethal Projectile: This patent describes a motion sensing system within the WEP. The sensor will monitor movement of the target and enable the electrical output until the target is subdued. The electrical pulse is programmed for an exact time-frame to specifications of the user.
 Provisional Patent & Trademark:
 (e) Payload carrying arrangement for a non-lethal projectile: This Provisional patent relates to the process of carrying liquid and powder payloads in the head of the BIP munitions that upon impact release from the head and are dispersed upon the target.
 (f) A trademark for the BIP trade name has been issued from the United States Patent and Trademark Office under the number Reg. No. 5,339,826. 
 The Companys policy has been to write off cost incurred in connection with non-provisional and provisional patent costs as well as trademark costs, as they are incurred as a recoverability of such expenditure is uncertain.
