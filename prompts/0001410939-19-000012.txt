Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are a science-driven biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel therapies to treat ophthalmic diseases, with a focus on age-related and orphan retinal diseases. We are seeking to leverage our development platform, clinical experience and retina expertise to develop both therapeutics and gene therapies in these disease areas. We believe gene therapy as a treatment modality holds tremendous promise for ophthalmic diseases. We also believe therapeutics will continue to serve an important role in ophthalmic drug development, particularly as treatments with novel mechanisms of action are developed and brought to market and as the long-term effects of these treatments continue to be understood. Our team has significant ophthalmic drug development experience and deep relationships with global ophthalmology thought leaders. We have an extensive network of ophthalmic clinical trial sites, having worked with over 250 sites worldwide. We believe that the combination of these factors, together with our experience in designing and executing investigational new drug, or IND, -enabling studies and clinical trials for eye diseases, and specifically back of the eye diseases, provide us a competitive advantage. 
We currently have ongoing research and development programs for both therapeutics and gene therapy product candidates and technologies. 
Our therapeutics portfolio consists of Zimura® (avacincaptad pegol), which is a C5 complement inhibitor, and our program of High temperature requirement A serine peptidase 1 protein, or HtrA1, inhibitors. We have Phase 2b clinical trials ongoing evaluating Zimura for the treatment of:

• | geographic atrophy, or GA, which is a late-stage form of dry age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, characterized by retinal cell death and degeneration of tissue in the central portion of the retina, referred to as the macula, and which may result in loss of vision; and


• | autosomal recessive Stargardt disease, or STGD1, which is an orphan inherited retinal disease, or IRD, that also may result in loss of vision.

We previously also evaluated Zimura in combination with Lucentis® (ranibizumab), an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, or anti-VEGF, agent, for the treatment of wet AMD, for which we completed a Phase 2a clinical trial during the fourth quarter of 2018. We do not currently have plans to develop Zimura further in wet AMD. Our HtrA1 inhibitor program, which we are developing for GA secondary to dry AMD and potentially other age-related retinal diseases, such as wet AMD and idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, or IPCV, is in the preclinical stage of development.

Our gene therapy portfolio consists of several ongoing research and preclinical development programs that use adeno-associated virus, or AAV, for gene delivery. These AAV gene therapy programs are targeting the following orphan IRDs: 

• | rhodopsin-mediated autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, or RHO-adRP, which is characterized by progressive and severe bilateral loss of vision leading to blindness;


• | Best vitelliform macular dystrophy, or Best disease, which is characterized by bilateral egg yolk-like macular lesions that, over time, progress to atrophy and loss of vision, and potentially other diseases associated with mutations in the Best1 gene, which we refer to as bestrophinopathies;


• | Leber Congenital Amaurosis type 10, or LCA10, which is characterized by severe bilateral loss of vision at or soon after birth; and


• | autosomal recessive Stargardt disease.

Therapeutic Development Programs
Zimura Clinical Programs
Zimura, our C5 complement inhibitor, is a chemically-synthesized, pegylated RNA aptamer. Aptamers are short molecules made up of a single stranded nucleic acid sequence or amino acid sequence that binds molecular targets with high selectivity and specificity. We currently have two clinical trials for Zimura ongoing. These clinical trials are designed to obtain data to guide potential future development efforts and are not intended to be pivotal studies. The following is a brief description of these trials and their current status:

• | OPH2003 (geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to dry AMD): an ongoing, randomized, double-masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy in patients with GA secondary to dry AMD. We completed enrollment for this clinical trial in October 2018 with a total of 286 patients enrolled. We expect that initial, top-line data from this clinical trial will be available during the fourth quarter of 2019. 


• | OPH2005 (autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1)): an ongoing, randomized, double-masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of STGD1. We completed enrollment for this clinical trial in February 2019 with a total of 95 patients enrolled. We expect that initial, top-line data from this clinical trial will be available during the second half of 2020. 

HtrA1 Inhibitor Program
We are pursuing the preclinical development of certain HtrA1 inhibitors, to which we acquired rights through our October 2018 acquisition of Inception 4, Inc., or Inception 4, for the treatment of GA secondary to dry AMD. Our HtrA1 inhibitor program includes a number of lead small molecule compounds that show high affinity and specificity for HtrA1 when tested, as well as a number of backup compounds. We are pursuing formulation development studies with the goal of identifying a formulation for intravitreal application in the eye. If we are successful in identifying and formulating a product candidate from this program, we plan to initiate IND-enabling activities for the selected product candidate. Based on current timelines and subject to successful completion of preclinical development, we are currently targeting submission of an IND to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for a product candidate from this program for the treatment of GA secondary to dry AMD by late 2020. 
Gene Therapy Research and Development Programs
RHO-adRP Product Candidate
We are pursuing the preclinical development of our novel AAV gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of RHO-adRP, to which we acquired exclusive development and commercialization rights through a June 2018 license agreement with the University of Florida Research Foundation, or UFRF, and the University of Pennsylvania, or Penn. We and Penn are conducting additional preclinical studies of the RHO-adRP product candidate and a natural history study of RHO-adRP patients. In parallel, we have commenced IND-enabling activities for the RHO-adRP product candidate, including manufacturing for preclinical toxicology studies. We have engaged a gene therapy contract development and manufacturing 
3


organization, or CDMO, as the manufacturer for preclinical and Phase 1/2 clinical supply of our RHO-adRP product candidate. Based on current timelines and subject to regulatory review, we expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for this product candidate during 2020. 
Bestrophinopathies Program
We have an exclusive option agreement with Penn and UFRF to acquire an exclusive, global license to develop and commercialize novel AAV gene therapy product candidates for the treatment of Best disease and other bestrophinopathies. We and Penn are conducting additional preclinical studies of a product candidate from this program and natural history studies of patients with bestrophinopathies. In parallel, we are planning to commence IND-enabling activities for a product candidate from this program, including manufacturing for preclinical toxicology studies. We have recently engaged a CDMO as the manufacturer for preclinical and Phase 1/2 clinical supply of this product candidate. Based on current timelines and subject to regulatory review and execution of a definitive license agreement with Penn and UFRF, we expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for a product candidate from this program during 2021. 
University of Massachusetts Medical School Research (LCA10 and STGD1; Gene Delivery Methods)
We are funding three sponsored research programs at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, or UMMS. Two of these programs consist of utilizing a "minigene" approach to create AAV gene therapy product candidates targeting LCA10 and STGD1. AAV vectors are generally limited as a delivery vehicle by the size of their genetic cargo, which is restricted to approximately 4,700 base pairs of genetic code. The use of "minigenes" seeks to deliver a smaller but still functional form of a larger gene packaged into a standard-size AAV delivery vector. The third program consists of evaluating various AAV gene delivery methods for potential application in the eye. UMMS has granted us an option to obtain an exclusive license to any patents or patent applications that result from any of these sponsored research programs. The sponsored research at UMMS is ongoing and we expect to receive results from the sponsored research for LCA10 during 2019, at which point we may elect to exercise our option to in-license the LCA10 program. 
The following table summarizes the current status of our ongoing research and development programs: 
* We have an option to exclusively in-license intellectual property resulting from ongoing sponsored research.
Business Development Activities
In 2018, we continued to implement a business development strategy, which we started to undertake in early 2017, based on reviewing our strategic alternatives in light of our deep expertise and experience in ophthalmic drug development and 
4


our business plan. Without limiting any option, the principal focus of this strategy was to actively explore obtaining rights to additional products, product candidates and technologies to treat ophthalmic diseases, particularly those in the back of the eye. These efforts have resulted in the expansion of our research and development pipeline, with the initiation of our gene therapy sponsored research programs with UMMS in February 2018, the in-license of our RHO-adRP gene therapy product candidate in June 2018, the acquisition of our HtrA1 inhibitor program in October 2018 and the entry into our exclusive option agreement with Penn and UFRF for gene therapy product candidates for bestrophinopathies in October 2018. We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to potentially obtain rights to additional gene therapy and therapeutic product candidates on a selective basis. We intend to continue to focus on opportunities that present a compelling scientific rationale, have the potential to address an unmet medical need and present a meaningful commercial opportunity. To the extent feasible, we plan to target opportunities where we believe third-party funding for specific programs or technologies may be available. 
Eye Diseases
Eye diseases can be caused by many factors and can affect both the front or back of the eye. In more severe cases, eye diseases can result in total loss of vision. In the developed world, the most common eye diseases that can result in total loss of vision are those affecting the retina and optic nerve, including AMD, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. These diseases deprive patients of their sight and, as a result, impair their ability to live independently and perform daily activities. Any improvement in vision, or even a slowing of the rate of progression of vision loss, has a tremendous impact on the quality of life of people with impaired vision. There are many other eye diseases that are less common but still represent an unmet medical need, particularly orphan IRDs that are associated with mutations in a single gene, referred to as monogenic, that lead to retinal degeneration and vision loss, generally in younger patients. We believe that these disease areas present several potential opportunities for ophthalmic drug development. A 2014 report from Prevent Blindness, a patient advocacy group, estimated that the total real annual costs in the United States related to eye diseases and vision problems expressed in constant 2014 dollars would increase from $145 billion in 2014 to $376 billion by 2050. 
Age Related Macular Degeneration
AMD is a disease characterized by progressive degenerative abnormalities in the macula, a small area in the central portion of the retina responsible for sharp vision. AMD is characteristically a disease of the elderly and is the leading cause of blindness in individuals over the age of 50 in developed countries. There are two forms of AMD, dry AMD and wet AMD. Most AMD patients initially present with dry AMD, which generally progresses slowly over multiple years and may ultimately result in GA, which is characterized by degeneration of tissue in the macula. By contrast, wet or neovascular AMD, which is characterized by the growth of abnormal new blood vessels under and into the retina, although less prevalent, is more likely to cause sudden, often substantial, loss of vision.
According to Brightfocus Foundation, approximately 11 million people in the United States have some form of AMD, including both early and late stages of the dry and wet forms. We estimate that there are a similar number of affected individuals in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, which are the five major market countries for pharmaceutical treatments in Western Europe, commonly referred to as the EU5, as these countries, in the aggregate, have a population similar to that of the United States. As the populations in the United States and Western Europe continue to age, we expect that these numbers will increase. In addition to having a devastating effect on patients, AMD also has a significant impact on the economy. According to a 2010 study sponsored by AMD Alliance International, the annual direct healthcare system costs of visual impairment worldwide due to AMD were estimated at approximately $255 billion.
Dry AMD
Dry AMD is a significant cause of moderate and severe loss of vision, affecting vision in both eyes in most patients. Although dry AMD is the most common form of AMD, there are no FDA or European Medicines Agency, or EMA, approved therapies to treat this condition. In dry AMD, thinning of the retinal pigment epithelial, or RPE, cells in the macula develops, along with other age-related changes to the adjacent retinal and choroidal tissue layers. The RPE is a layer of cells within the retina on which photoreceptors, the cells in the retina that are responsible for capturing light and converting it to electrochemical signals to the brain, are dependent for nutrients, waste disposal and other needs. Dry AMD is typically associated with yellow-white dots or deposits under the RPE, known as drusen. Unlike in wet AMD, there is no abnormal new blood vessel growth, or neovascularization, in dry AMD. The presence of drusen, in the absence of pathological neovascularization, is critical for making the diagnosis of dry AMD in patients over 50 years of age. 
The progression of visual outcomes for patients with dry AMD is variable. Most patients experience mild to moderate loss of visual function, manifesting in blurring of central vision in the affected eye, as a result of progressive degeneration of 
5


the light-sensitive photoreceptor cells in the macula. There are two instances in which visual loss from dry AMD may lead to severe vision loss:

• | Geographic Atrophy. The progression of dry AMD with age can result in a severe form of retinal degeneration called GA, which typically leads to profound and irreversible vision loss. GA is readily diagnosed during retinal examination using standard diagnostic instruments utilized by ophthalmologists. GA appears as abrupt and deep levels of macular tissue loss, with sharp margins of characteristic degeneration compared to surrounding healthier macular tissue, which results in progressive and chronic degeneration of the retina characterized by variable thinning and dysfunction of retinal tissue. A comprehensive epidemiology study published in 2004 in Archives of Ophthalmology estimated that there were approximately 1 million people in the United States with GA. 


• | Conversion to Wet AMD. Dry AMD progresses to the wet form of the disease in approximately 10% – 15% of patients, leading to more rapid and further visual loss. Wet AMD occurs when new and abnormal blood vessels proliferate under or within the retina. These abnormal new blood vessels originate beneath the retina, in a layer called the choroid, and invade into the overlying retinal layers. Unlike dry AMD, there are FDA-approved therapies for wet AMD, of which the current standard of care is the administration of anti-VEGF monotherapy agents by intravitreal injection. 

The absence of treatment options for dry AMD represents an area of urgent unmet medical need, and a major public health concern for the rapidly increasing elderly population. As progressive atrophy is associated with vision loss, a treatment that results in the slowing of the progression of atrophy would represent a significant medical advancement. 
Inherited Retinal Diseases
Inherited retinal diseases, or IRDs, are a group of eye disorders caused by one or more inherited gene mutations that result in lack of functional proteins necessary for normal vision. Generally, IRDs are severe and progressive and will result in vision loss or blindness, either at birth or in early childhood, or gradually over time. IRDs are generally orphan diseases, meaning that these diseases affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Partially due to their orphan nature, there are no approved treatment options available for most IRDs. Recently, gene therapies have emerged as potential therapies for monogenic IRDs, where a mutation to a single gene has been identified as the cause. 
Humans generally inherit a complete set of genes from each of their parents, and therefore have two copies, or alleles, for each gene, either of which may carry a mutation, and either, or both, of which may be expressed in particular cells throughout the body. An inherited condition is referred to as autosomal recessive when the subject must inherit mutated alleles from each parent for the condition to manifest. An inherited condition is referred to as autosomal dominant when the subject must only inherit one mutated allele from either parent for the condition to manifest. The predominant or standard, non-mutated form of a gene is referred to as the wildtype form, and the protein resulting from expression of the wildtype gene is referred to as wildtype protein. In autosomal recessive conditions, because both alleles for a particular gene carry a mutation, the subject cannot produce any wildtype protein, and instead the proteins that are expressed, if any, have either limited or no function. In autosomal dominant conditions, a number of factors may contribute to the condition: 

• | a subject may express only the mutant allele and not the wildtype allele, resulting in production of only protein with limited or no function and not the wildtype protein;


• | a subject may be expressing both alleles, but because of the mutation on one of the alleles, the amount of functional protein may not be sufficient; or


• | the protein expressed by the mutant allele may be toxic to the cells in which it is produced.

Stargardt Disease
Stargardt disease is an IRD that causes progressive damage to the macula and retina, leading to loss of vision in children and adolescents. Multiple sources, including the National Eye Institute and Genetics Home Reference, both of which are affiliated with the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH, estimate the prevalence of Stargardt disease to be between 1 in 8,000 and 1 in 10,000, implying that in the United States and EU5 on a combined basis, there are a total of 62,000 to 77,000 affected persons. The most common form of Stargardt disease is the autosomal recessive form, which we refer to as STGD1. STGD1 is caused by mutations in the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, number 4, or ABCA4 gene, which is responsible for making a protein that helps to clear byproducts resulting from the visual cycle from inside photoreceptor cells in the eye. 
6


There are currently no therapies approved by the FDA or EMA to treat Stargardt disease. The FDA has recognized Stargardt disease as an orphan disease, with several treatments in development having received orphan drug designation from the FDA.
Rhodopsin-Mediated Autosomal Dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa
RHO-adRP is a form of retinitis pigmentosa, or RP. RP is the most prevalent IRD and is typically characterized by the initial degeneration of the rod photoreceptors, which are responsible for low light vision and peripheral vision. The degeneration of the rod photoreceptors over time leads to the degeneration of the cone photoreceptors, which are the photoreceptors in the central part of the retina that are responsible for color and sharp vision. This degeneration causes night blindness and severe and progressive visual impairment. Although often diagnosed during adolescence or young adulthood, most RP patients become legally blind by age 40.
Rhodopsin is a biological pigment found in the rod photoreceptors that is extremely sensitive to light and thus is crucial for low light vision. There are more than 150 identified mutations in the gene for rhodopsin. The presence of a mutated rhodopsin gene is linked to the occurrence of RP. 
Based on disease prevalence rates contained in a study published in the Archives of Ophthalmology in 2007, we estimate that in the United States and EU5 on a combined basis, there are a total of approximately 11,000 affected persons with RHO-adRP. There is currently no FDA or EMA approved therapy to treat this orphan IRD.
Bestrophinopathies
Bestrophinopathies are a group of IRDs associated with mutations in the Best1 gene. The Best1 gene encodes a multifunctional protein known as bestrophin-1, or BEST1, which regulates chemical transport and signaling in RPE cells and helps maintain homeostasis in the subretinal space, the space between the photoreceptors and the RPE. The most common bestrophinopathy is Best vitelliform macular dystrophy, also known as Best disease, which is generally autosomal dominant and generally affects individuals in both eyes. In Best disease, the lack of functional BEST1 protein results in the formation of egg yolk-like lesions in the macula that, over time, progress to macular atrophy and permanent loss of vision. In addition, because there are over 200 known mutations in the Best1 gene, there are other bestrophinopathies being studied, including autosomal recessive forms. 
Based on disease prevalence rates contained in a study published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology in 2012, we estimate that in the United States and EU5 on a combined basis, there are a total of approximately 10,000 affected persons with Best disease, the substantial majority of whom we believe have the autosomal dominant form of the disease. There are currently no FDA or EMA approved therapies to treat bestrophinopathies.
Leber Congenital Amaurosis Type 10
Leber Congenital Amaurosis, or LCA, is an IRD that manifests at birth or early in childhood. It is characterized by early onset of vision loss in children leading to blindness. Affected individuals often manifest symptoms such as roving eye movements, deep-set eyes and sensitivity to bright light. There are multiple types of LCA, which are associated with mutations in different genes. The most common type is LCA10, which is caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene. Mutations in the CEP290 gene are believed to lead to the abnormal function and potentially loss of photoreceptor cells. 
Based on disease prevalence rates contained in a study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics in 2006, we estimate that in the United States and EU5 on a combined basis, there are a total of approximately 2,700 to 4,100 affected persons with LCA10. There is currently no FDA or EMA approved therapy to treat LCA10. 
Zimura
We are developing our product candidate Zimura, a C5 complement inhibitor, for the treatment of two ophthalmic conditions: GA secondary to dry AMD and STGD1. Zimura is a chemically-synthesized, pegylated RNA aptamer. Aptamers are short molecules made up of a single stranded nucleic acid sequence or an amino acid sequence. The specific three-dimensional structure of an aptamer, which results from its specific sequence, allows it to bind molecular targets with high selectivity and specificity. Zimura is a pegylated aptamer, which means that polyethylene glycol, or PEG, a common biochemical compound attached to drugs to increase their duration of action in the human body and to decrease immune response, is linked to the chemically-synthesized strand of RNA.

The Complement System and Its Potential Role in GA and STGD1
The complement system consists of a series of proteins that are involved in the defense of the host body against infectious agents, or pathogens, and other foreign proteins. The complement system modulates a variety of immune and inflammatory responses to these pathogens and foreign proteins. Under normal circumstances, complement proteins, together with antibodies and white blood cells, act beneficially to protect the host body by removing the pathogens and foreign proteins, together with other cellular debris. The complement system is generally tightly regulated, achieving the proper balance of activation and inhibition depending on the host body’s requirements. Poorly regulated or aberrant activation of the complement system, without a balanced or proportional inhibition of complement proteins, may result in a variety of pathological conditions. For example, in a third-party study published in Histology and Histopathology in 2012, researchers found that human retinal drusen deposits, which are the hallmark of dry AMD, contained components of complement proteins.

 The complement system is generally activated via one of three biological pathways commonly referred to as the classical pathway, the alternative pathway and the lectin pathway. These pathways eventually converge with the generation of an enzyme known as C3 convertase. C3 convertase cleaves, or separates, a serum protein called C3, into C3a and C3b. C3b is an important element of the body’s immune response, as it binds to pathogens and makes them susceptible to destruction by white blood cells. C3b also cleaves complement protein C5. The cleavage of C5 results in the formation of the terminal complement fragments C5a and C5b. A study published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry in 2015 concluded that C5a primes RPE cells for inflammasome activation in the presence of waste products from the visual cycle. Inflammasomes are intracellular protein structures that lead to cell death. Formation of C5b, in combination with serum proteins C6, C7, C8 and C9, leads to the generation of C5b-9, referred to as membrane attack complex, or MAC, which has been shown to cause cell death. 
A simplified illustration of the complement system and the relationships between the complement proteins appears below:
Although the causes of AMD are not completely understood—in addition to advanced age, there are environmental and genetic risk factors that contribute to the development of AMD including ocular pigmentation, dietary factors, a positive family history for AMD, high blood pressure and smoking—a body of recent scientific literature suggests that complement system activation may also contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD. A study published in the Journal of Immunology in 2015 concluded that MAC accumulation in RPE cells leads to mitochondrial damage and cellular dysfunction, which we believe 
8


eventually leads to RPE cell death. Additionally, a study published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology in 2002 described the presence of MAC in post-mortem human donor eyes with dry AMD and GA. We believe these findings suggest that inhibition of the complement system, especially an inhibitor that prevents the cleavage of C5 into C5a and C5b, could prevent RPE cell death and potentially other pathological causes of AMD. 
The pathogenesis of STGD1, which is caused by a mutation in the ABCA4 gene, also may involve activation of the complement system. With a defective copy of the ABCA4 protein, waste byproducts that a normal ABCA4 protein would otherwise help to clear accumulate in the RPE. Waste byproducts that accumulate in the RPE are referred to as bisretinoids. We believe that the accumulation of bisretinoids in RPE cells leads to activation of the complement system and the accumulation of MAC. In RPE cells, MAC is normally cleared by lysosomes, which are organelles within cells responsible for waste degradation and disposal. Bisretinoid accumulation leads to lysosomal dysfunction, potentially preventing the clearance of MAC. MAC accumulation also negatively impacts energy production by mitochondria inside RPE cells. Bisretinoid and MAC accumulation may lead to RPE cell deterioration and contribute to the subsequent loss of photoreceptor cells, leading to a decrease in vision over time.
In April 2017, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, or PNAS, published a study reporting on the effects of complement system modulation in the RPE of a mouse model of Stargardt disease. The researchers injected recombinant AAV containing the coding sequence for CRRY, a protein that inhibits complement system activation, into albino ABCA4 mutant mice, which led to a two-fold reduction in the accumulation of bisretinoids and a 30% increase in the number of photoreceptor nuclei at one year. The study findings indicate that the inhibition of complement activation in the albino ABCA4 mutant mice lead to healthier RPE cells as compared to RPE cells of untreated mice. Researchers at Duke University published a 2013 paper in Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science, in which they found in an in vitro experiment that RPE cell damage resulting from the combination of complement system activation and visual cycle waste was more damaging than either component individually. When complement factor C5 was blocked, there was a significant improvement in RPE cell viability in vitro. Based on the data from these in vitro and in vivo experiments, we believe molecules involved in the inhibition or regulation of the complement system and MAC activation are prime targets for therapeutic intervention in STGD1.
Zimura is designed to target and inhibit the cleavage of complement protein C5 and the formation of the terminal fragments, C5a and C5b. By inhibiting the formation of complement system terminal fragments, Zimura may decrease the activation of inflammasomes and decrease the formation of MAC, thereby potentially avoiding or slowing the degeneration of RPE cells and providing the rationale as a potential therapy for both GA and STGD1. 
Our Zimura Clinical Programs
We have completed four clinical trials of Zimura to date: 

• | OPH2001: a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of GA; 


• | OPH2000: a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of Zimura administered in combination with Lucentis for the treatment of wet AMD; 


• | OPH2007: a Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura administered in combination with Lucentis for the treatment of wet AMD; and 


• | OPH2002: a very small Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura in combination with anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of IPCV, in patients for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy had failed. 

Over 160 patients have been treated with Zimura in these four completed trials, with treatment durations extending up to 48 weeks. All doses of Zimura administered in these trials were well-tolerated, with only a single adverse event, mild subcapsular cataract, assessed to be drug-related by participating investigators. 
Based on our clinical experience with Zimura, the scientific literature around complement in the eye and the positive Phase 2 data for a competitor's C3 complement inhibitor in GA, we believe Zimura holds promise as a potential treatment for several ophthalmic diseases, including, GA secondary to dry AMD and STGD1. Although we previously studied Zimura for wet AMD and IPCV, we do not currently have plans to develop Zimura further in those indications. We currently have two Phase 2b clinical trials for Zimura ongoing. These clinical trials are designed to obtain data to guide potential future development efforts and are not intended to be pivotal studies. The following is a brief description of these trials and their current status:

• | OPH2003 (geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to dry AMD): an ongoing, randomized, double–masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy in patients with GA secondary to dry AMD. We completed enrollment for this clinical trial in October 2018 with a total of 286 patients enrolled. We expect that initial, top-line data from this clinical trial will be available during the fourth quarter of 2019. 


• | OPH2005 (autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1)): an ongoing, randomized, double-masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of STGD1. We completed enrollment for this clinical trial in February 2019 with a total of 95 patients enrolled. We expect that initial, top-line data from this clinical trial will be available during the second half of 2020. 

Zimura is administered by intravitreal injection. Patients receiving intravitreal injections typically receive topical numbing drops or injection of a numbing agent prior to the injection. The administering physician also typically rinses the ocular surface with an antiseptic solution. By injecting the active agent into the vitreous cavity, the physician delivers the agent in close vicinity to the active disease site while minimizing the risk for systemic exposure to non-ocular tissues. 
An intravitreal injection results in elevation of intraocular pressure, or IOP, which is usually transient. In our clinical trials, the IOP is monitored after each intravitreal injection. Certain of the dosing regimens we are evaluating in our ongoing Zimura clinical trials involve multiple intravitreal injections administered on the same day. Based on our clinical experience to date, we have not seen any meaningful or sustained increase in IOP in clinical trials involving multiple intravitreal injections on the same day, and we believe that multiple intravitreal injections likely could be delivered safely on the same day.
As we continue to develop our portfolio and evaluate our overall strategic priorities, we may out-license certain rights to Zimura if we believe the arrangement could assist us in the development or potential commercialization of Zimura and would otherwise help us pursue our business plan and strategic goals.
Our Zimura clinical experience to date, as well as our ongoing clinical trials for Zimura, are described in greater detail below. 
Zimura - Dry AMD Trials

OPH2001: Completed Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial of Zimura for GA Secondary to Dry AMD
In 2011, we completed a multicenter, uncontrolled, open label Phase 1/2a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Zimura administered as a monotherapy in patients with GA. We enrolled 47 patients in this trial. We randomly assigned patients in this trial to one of two dose groups. Patients received a total of five intravitreal injections of either 0.3 mg or 1 mg of Zimura over a 36-week treatment period. Patients received an intravitreal injection of Zimura at day 0, week 4, week 8, week 24 and week 36 of the trial, with a final follow-up visit at week 48. 
Zimura was generally well-tolerated in this trial. We did not observe any evidence of drug related adverse events. We also did not observe any incidence of conversion to wet AMD in eyes treated with Zimura. Adverse events were primarily ocular adverse events in the study eye which were related to the injection procedure.
In addition, we performed assessments of visual acuity to detect any potential decrease in vision associated with intravitreal injections, the administered drug or natural progression of the disease if left untreated. We did not identify any drug related safety issues through measurements of visual acuity.    
Our Phase 1/2a clinical trial was an uncontrolled study with a small sample size and was not powered to detect a difference between Zimura dose groups, or the efficacy of Zimura monotherapy, with statistical significance. The primary purpose of the study was to assess safety and tolerability. However, during the more frequent dosing period, which is the first 24 weeks, we observed a trend, in favor of the higher of two dose groups, of a relative reduction in the mean growth of the GA lesion area, as measured by fundus autofluorescence images read by an independent reading center. Fundus autofluorescence is a common technique for photographing and documenting the size of GA present in the back of the eye, or fundus. Autofluorescence refers to the natural emission of light by biological structures. In fundus autofluorescence images, areas of atrophy are characterized by lower fluorescence.

The mean growth from baseline in the GA lesion area during the first 24 weeks of the trial, when the injections were administered more regularly, was 1.00 mm2 for the 24 patients receiving the 0.3 mg dose and 0.78 mm2 for the 23 patients receiving the 1 mg dose. When the injections were administered on a reduced dosing schedule during the subsequent 24 weeks, this relative trend in reduced growth in GA lesion area was no longer present. The following graph sets forth the mean change in GA lesion area from baseline for the two treatment groups over the course of the trial.
We believe this apparent trend in the relative reduction of mean growth in GA lesion area when Zimura was dosed more frequently, together with the relative loss of the benefit when Zimura was dosed less frequently, may suggest a possible drug effect. 
OPH2003: Ongoing Phase 2b Clinical Trial of Zimura for GA Secondary to Dry AMD
We are currently conducting a randomized, double–masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy in patients with GA secondary to dry AMD. We initiated this trial during the fourth quarter of 2015 and initially planned to enroll 300 patients in an initial stage of the trial, with an interim analysis scheduled for the 18-month time point, and to potentially enroll up to an additional 600 patients thereafter. During 2017, based on the announcement of positive data from a competitor studying a different complement inhibitor in a Phase 2 trial in GA, we modified this trial to accelerate the timeline to obtain top-line data by reducing the number of patients in the trial to approximately 200 and shortening the time point for measuring the primary efficacy endpoint to 12 months. Prior to this initial modification taking effect, we had enrolled approximately 77 patients who were randomized into one of three treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio in Part 1 of the trial as follows:

• | monthly intravitreal injection of 1 mg of Zimura;


• | monthly intravitreal injection of 2 mg of Zimura; and


• | monthly sham injection.

These patients remained in the trial following the initial modification. Following review of additional third-party clinical trial data and further statistical analysis, we decided to expand this trial to include additional patients. The approximately 209 additional patients enrolled in Part 2 of the trial were randomized into one of three treatment groups in a 1:2:2 ratio as follows:

• | monthly intravitreal injection of 2 mg of Zimura plus a sham injection;


• | monthly intravitreal injections of 4 mg of Zimura, administered as two injections of 2 mg of Zimura on the same day; and


• | monthly sham injections, administered as two separate sham injections.

11


The primary efficacy endpoint is an anatomic endpoint, the mean change in rate of GA growth at 12 months, as measured by fundus autofluorescence. We plan to analyze the primary efficacy endpoint for the 2 mg treatment groups as compared to sham and for the 4 mg treatment group as compared to sham. The statistical analysis of a clinical trial outcome is primarily determined based on three factors: variability in the measured endpoint among the patient population, the magnitude of the drug effect observed in relation to that variability and the number of patients from whom data is collected in the clinical trial. Given that we have limited data regarding the effect of Zimura in GA, we determined the size of the OPH2003 trial based on our best estimates of the size of trial required to demonstrate a potential clinical benefit for Zimura.  This estimate incorporates our assumptions regarding the potential performance of Zimura in this indication based in part on available third-party clinical trial data and our statistical analysis of this data, as well as our assumptions regarding the number of patients that will continue to participate in the trial through the 12-month timepoint.  Given the information above, this trial could be underpowered to demonstrate a potential clinical benefit for Zimura in this indication.
We completed enrollment for this trial in October 2018 with a total of 286 patients enrolled and expect initial top-line data from this trial to be available during the fourth quarter of 2019 following the 12-month timepoint for all patients. We plan to treat and follow patients for 18 months. Treating and following patients for six months beyond the 12-month timepoint used for the primary efficacy endpoint will provide additional safety and efficacy information regarding Zimura in this indication.
Zimura - STGD1 Trials

OPH2005: Ongoing Phase 2b Clinical Trial of Zimura for STGD1
We are currently conducting a randomized, double-masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of STGD1. We completed patient enrollment for this clinical trial in February 2019 with a total of 95 patients enrolled. The patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio as follows:

• | 2 mg of Zimura, followed by 2mg of Zimura 14 days later, monthly for three months during an induction phase; followed by 4 mg of Zimura, administered as two injections of 2 mg of Zimura on the same day, monthly for 15 additional months during a maintenance phase; and


• | a sham injection, followed by a sham injection 14 days later, monthly for three months; followed by two sham injections on the same day, monthly for 15 months.

We plan to evaluate the primary efficacy endpoint in this trial at 18 months. The primary efficacy endpoint is an anatomic endpoint, the mean rate of change in the area of ellipsoid zone defect, as measured by en-face spectral domain optical coherence tomography, or SD-OCT. SD-OCT is an ultra-high resolution imaging technology commonly used to visualize the retinal tissue. SD-OCT is capable of rendering images in multiple dimensions and from multiple perspectives. This imaging technology allows the demonstration of various layers of the retinal tissue, including the ellipsoid zone, which is a part of the photoreceptor cells. Scientific literature correlates defects in the ellipsoid zone with the loss of visual acuity and visual dysfunction. The ellipsoid zone is rendered in SD-OCT images as a defined layer of photoreceptor cell segments. Areas of defects in the ellipsoid zone can be detected and measured by en-face SD-OCT, which shows an SD-OCT image from the perspective of looking at the retina head-on. 
We previously engaged the Foundation Fighting Blindness to provide us with data from the Foundation's publicly available ProgStar study, the largest natural history study on Stargardt disease to date. We have used this natural history data, as well as the perspectives of the key opinion leaders involved in the ProgStar study, as resources to assist in the design of the OPH2005 trial. Furthermore, our work on this clinical trial has resulted in the expansion of our network of thought leaders and clinical trial sites to include leading research university hospitals around the world, where patients with orphan retinal diseases are often referred. 
We have not previously studied Zimura in STGD1 patients and thus do not have any clinical data regarding the effect of Zimura in STGD1. We had planned to enroll approximately 120 patients for this trial, which was the number of patients we believed could potentially be enrolled within a reasonable period of time. We decided, however, to cease patient enrollment during the first quarter of 2019 in light of the 18-month endpoint and our goal of providing initial top-line data from this trial by the end of 2020. We completed patient enrollment in February 2019 with a total of 95 patients enrolled. As STGD1 is an orphan indication, to our knowledge there is only very limited natural history data currently available regarding the variability of the planned primary efficacy endpoint in the STGD1 patient population we enrolled in this trial. Given the information above, this trial could be underpowered to demonstrate a potential clinical benefit for Zimura in this indication.

We expect initial top-line data from this trial to be available during the second half of 2020. 
Zimura - Wet AMD Trials    
OPH2000: Completed Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial of Zimura for Wet AMD
In 2009, we completed a multicenter, uncontrolled, ascending dose and parallel group, open-label, first in human Phase 1/2a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple intravitreal injections of Zimura given in combination with multiple doses of 0.5 mg of Lucentis (ranibizumab) in patients with wet AMD. We enrolled 60 patients in this trial, of which 58 were treatment-naïve patients, and two were treatment-experienced patients. 
Patients were treated at one of five Zimura dose levels: 0.03 mg, 0.3 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg and 3 mg. Zimura was generally well tolerated in this trial when tested in combination with Lucentis. None of the patients experienced any dose limiting toxicities at any of the dose levels tested. We observed only a single adverse event assessed by the investigators to be related to Zimura, mild subcapsular cataract in one patient in the group treated with 2 mg of Zimura. Despite this event, this patient's visual acuity improved during the study. Adverse events were primarily ocular adverse events in the study eye which were related to the injection procedure. One patient from the 0.3 mg Zimura treatment group withdrew from the trial as a result of a serious adverse event of bacteremia unrelated to study drug or injection procedure, which resulted in a subsequent fatality. Another patient from the 0.3 mg treatment group withdrew from the trial due to the investigator's decision. Systemic adverse events in this trial were not frequently reported. No systemic adverse events were assessed as drug related.
Our Phase 1/2a clinical trial was an uncontrolled study with a small sample size and was not powered to detect a difference between Zimura dose groups or the efficacy of Zimura combination therapy with statistical significance. The primary purpose of the study was to assess safety and tolerability. In addition to our safety assessment, however, we also performed assessments of visual acuity. There was a general trend towards an improvement in visual acuity seen in all treatment groups. We focused our assessment of vision outcomes on the subgroup of 43 treatment-naïve patients who had received all six Zimura injections at the same dosage. We observed a mean increase in visual acuity from baseline at all time points for these patients, based on the number of ETDRS letters the patient could read. For this subgroup, at week 24 of the trial, we noted improvements in mean visual acuity from baseline as follows: 13.6 letters for the 13 patients receiving the 0.3 mg dose, 11.7 letters for the 15 patients receiving the 1 mg dose and 15.3 letters for the 15 patients receiving the 2 mg dose. In this subgroup, 22 patients (51%) gained at least 15 ETDRS letters, defined as significant visual gain, consisting of six patients (46%) in the 0.3 mg dose group, seven patients (47%) in the 1 mg dose group and nine patients (60%) in the 2 mg dose group.
OPH2004: Discontinued Phase 2a Trial of Zimura for Treatment-Experienced Wet AMD Patients
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated an open-label Phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate Zimura’s potential role when administered in combination with anti-VEGF therapy for the treatment of wet AMD in anti-VEGF treatment-experienced patients who did not respond adequately to anti-VEGF monotherapy. In 2017, following our reassessment of our Zimura development programs, we stopped enrolling patients in this trial as we determined that we would initiate a new Zimura wet AMD trial, the OPH2007 trial described below, for treatment-naïve patients. One patient continued to receive treatment in this trial until the first half of 2018. This patient did not experience any drug-related adverse events and there were no unexpected safety issues.
OPH2007: Completed Phase 2a Clinical Trial of Zimura for Treatment-Naïve Wet AMD Patients
In 2018, we completed a randomized, dose-ranging, open-label, multi-center Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura in combination with 0.5 mg of Lucentis to evaluate the safety of different dosing regimens of Zimura in combination with an anti-VEGF agent in treating wet AMD. We enrolled a total of 64 treatment-naïve patients for this trial. We assigned patients in this trial to one of four groups:

• | In Groups 1 and 2, consisting of ten patients in each group, patients received monthly combination therapy consisting of 0.5 mg of Lucentis followed by, in Group 1, 4 mg of Zimura two days later and in Group 2, 2 mg of Zimura on the same day as the Lucentis treatment;


• | In Groups 3 and 4, consisting of 22 patients in each group, patients received dosages in two phases, consisting of:


◦ | first, an induction phase from day one to the second month, during which the patients received 0.5 mg of Lucentis followed by 2 mg of Zimura on the same day, followed by 2 mg of Zimura fourteen days later; and

13



◦ | second, a maintenance phase from the third month to the fifth month, during which the patients received, in Group 3, 0.5 mg of Lucentis followed by 2 mg of Zimura on the same day and in Group 4, 2 mg of Zimura followed two days later with 0.5 mg of Lucentis and 2 mg of Zimura.

From a safety perspective, Zimura combination therapy with Lucentis was generally well tolerated after six months of treatment. The most frequently reported ocular adverse events were related to the injection procedure. We did not observe any adverse events attributable to Zimura combination therapy. 
Our Phase 2a clinical trial was an uncontrolled trial with a small sample size designed to assess safety at different dosages and to detect a potential efficacy signal. This trial was not designed to detect a statistically significant difference between Zimura dose groups or to evaluate the efficacy of Zimura combination therapy with statistical significance.
We evaluated the mean change in best corrected visual acuity at the six-month timepoint as compared to baseline. The data are summarized as follows:

• | In Group 1, the mean change in visual acuity was 9.0 ETDRS letters with a median of 7.0 letters, and 40% of the patients gained greater than or equal to three lines of vision, or 15 ETDRS letters, defined as significant visual gain;


• | In Group 2, the mean change in visual acuity was 10.2 ETDRS letters with a median of 16.0 letters, and 60% of patients gained greater than or equal to 15 ETDRS letters;


• | In Group 3, the mean change in visual acuity was 10.7 ETDRS letters with a median of 10.0 letters, and 40.9% of patients gained greater than or equal to 15 ETDRS letters; and


• | In Group 4, the mean change in visual acuity was 9.9 ETDRS letters with a median of 11.0 letters, and 18.2% of patients gained greater than or equal to 15 ETDRS letters.

At this point, we have decided not to proceed with further development of Zimura in wet AMD and instead focus our resources on the development of Zimura in our clinical programs in GA secondary to dry AMD and STGD1.
Zimura - IPCV Trials
OPH2002: Completed Phase 2a Clinical Trial of Zimura for IPCV

In late 2014, we initiated a very small, uncontrolled, open-label, Phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate Zimura’s potential role when administered in combination with anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of IPCV in treatment-experienced patients for whom anti-VEGF monotherapy failed. IPCV is an age-related disease that is similar to wet AMD and is commonly characterized by leakage under the RPE, subretinal hemorrhage and RPE detachment. We enrolled four patients in the trial. None of the patients had a greater than 15-ETDRS letter decrease in visual acuity, which is considered a significant loss in visual acuity, following treatment in this study. None of the patients experienced any drug-related adverse events and there were no unexpected safety issues from this trial. 
OPH2006: Discontinued Phase 2a Trial of Zimura for IPCV
In late 2017, we initiated a randomized, dose-ranging, open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura in combination with Eylea® (aflibercept), an anti-VEGF agent, in treatment-experienced patients with IPCV. We did not enroll any patients in this clinical trial and decided to discontinue this clinical trial. We currently do not have any plans to further develop Zimura in IPCV. 
HtrA1 Inhibitor Program
In October 2018, we acquired Inception 4, a private biopharmaceutical company owned by funds controlled by Versant Ventures. We acquired Inception 4 through a merger with our subsidiary, Orion Ophthalmology LLC, or Orion. Through this acquisition, we obtained worldwide development and commercialization rights to certain HtrA1 inhibitors. We are currently developing this program for the treatment of GA secondary to dry AMD and may in the future evaluate HtrA1 inhibition as a potential treatment modality for other age-related retinal diseases, such as wet AMD and IPCV.
14


The HtrA1 gene encodes for an enzyme that may affect cellular structure, function and homeostasis, which is the dynamic equilibrium maintained in cells and tissue required for normal physiology. Genetic linkage studies, including a study published in Molecular Vision in 2017, show a correlation between the expression of HtrA1 and a certain set of genes conferring risk for AMD. A study of post-mortem eyes from subjects with AMD published in EBioMedicine in 2018 found overexpression of HtrA1 in RPE cells as compared to the eyes of non-AMD subjects. Additionally, the overexpression of HtrA1 was found, in an in vitro experiment published in the same article, to lead to alterations and disruptions in the morphology and function of RPE cells. Although the causal pathway between expression of HtrA1 and AMD is still not well understood, we believe that these findings suggest that HtrA1 overexpression may play a role in AMD and that molecules involved in the regulation and inhibition of HtrA1 may have therapeutic benefit in the treatment of dry AMD, including GA, as well as potentially other age-related retinal diseases, such as wet AMD and IPCV. 
Our HtrA1 inhibitor program includes a number of lead small molecule compounds that show high affinity and specificity for HtrA1 when tested in vitro and target engagement when tested in multiple animal models, as well as a number of backup compounds. We are pursuing formulation development studies with the goal of identifying a formulation for intravitreal application in the eye. If we are successful in identifying and formulating a product candidate from this program, we plan to initiate IND-enabling activities for the selected product candidate. 
In connection with our acquisition of Inception 4, we also received approximately $6.1 million in cash, which we believe will be sufficient to fund the substantial majority of anticipated development costs associated with this program through the IND submission stage. Based on current timelines and subject to successful completion of preclinical development, we are currently targeting submission of an IND to the FDA for a product candidate from this program for the treatment of GA secondary to dry AMD by late 2020. 
Gene Therapy Research and Development Programs
As we continue to evaluate the unmet medical needs for orphan and age-related retinal diseases, as well as the available technologies in development to potentially address these needs, we have been particularly encouraged by the prospects for gene therapy as a potential treatment modality in ophthalmology. 
In February 2018, we announced that an element of our strategy would include initiating collaborative gene therapy programs focused on discovering and developing novel gene therapy technologies to treat retinal diseases, including through collaborations with leading companies and academic research institutions in the United States and internationally. To date, we have established gene therapy programs with three leading academic research institutions in the United States. These programs are described in detail below. 
The Potential of Gene Therapies for Ophthalmic Diseases
Gene therapy consists of delivering DNA encoding for a functional protein to a target tissue to facilitate protein synthesis using a recipient's existing cellular machinery. Gene therapy can be used to replace a non-functional protein produced innately by the subject as a result of a genetic mutation or as a means of producing and delivering a therapeutic protein that would not otherwise be produced within the body. Many IRDs are monogenic, meaning they are caused by mutations in a single gene, and therefore could potentially be addressed by a gene replacement approach. For genetic diseases where the mutant protein has toxic effect, we have been encouraged by the potential for a “knockdown” and “replace” approach in which gene therapy not only can introduce a healthy or wildtype version of the gene into the host body but also can suppress the expression of the mutant gene. Furthermore, because gene therapy may result in a lasting, or even permanent, addition to a host body's genetic code, gene therapy has potential for an extended treatment effect through a single administration. We therefore believe that gene therapy also holds promise as a potential treatment for age-related and other non-orphan retinal diseases, especially for diseases where patients might otherwise require chronic therapy over years, if not decades.
Currently, most gene therapies for application in the eye are administered via subretinal injection. Subretinal injection is a surgical procedure in which the gene therapy vector is injected by a retinal surgeon into the potential space between the photoreceptors and the RPE and often as close as practicable to the site of desired protein expression. Once the vector is present in the target tissue area, the process by which the gene of interest is inserted into host cells by the delivery vehicle can begin. This process is referred to as transduction and the gene therapy delivery vehicle is referred to as a vector. 
Gene Therapy Products and AAV Vectors
A gene therapy product typically includes the gene of interest, or transgene, together with a promoter sequence. The composition of the transgene may differ from that of the wildtype form of the gene—for example, the gene may be modified to 
15


increase the expression of the target protein. Promoters are DNA sequences that are linked to a gene and control the transcription of a gene into RNA in the host body's cells. There are cell-specific promoters, which tend to drive gene expression in particular cell or tissue types - for example, the RPE and photoreceptors. The choice of the specific promoter that is to be linked to a transgene is an important consideration in constructing a gene therapy product.
The promoter-transgene combination is packaged together into a delivery vehicle to facilitate localization within the relevant tissue within the body. Gene therapies are typically delivered via viral vectors and among those, adeno-associated virus, or AAV, has become the most common choice for gene therapy applications inside the eye. AAV is a small, non-pathogenic cold virus. To create the vector, the DNA encoding the AAV viral genes is removed, disarming the virus, and is replaced with the therapeutic gene sequence. In addition to AAV, other gene delivery vehicles include vectors derived from lentivirus and non-viral based vectors.
We have particularly focused on AAV gene therapy, as AAV vectors have generally been found to transduce RPE, photoreceptors and other retinal cells at a high rate, and their safety profile in humans is relatively well-documented as compared to other delivery vehicles, such as lentiviral vectors. Gene editing approaches, such as CRISPR, in which the host DNA is modified, altered or removed via therapeutic intervention, are also emerging as a potential treatment modality for genetic diseases. Unlike lentiviral vectors or gene editing approaches, with AAV gene therapy, the delivered genetic cargo does not incorporate into or alter the host cell's existing DNA and chromosomes, but rather remains separate in the host cell's nucleus, where it can be transcribed by the host cell's existing machinery.
There are several naturally-occurring serotypes of AAV, including AAV2, AAV5, AAV8 and AAV9, as well as countless synthetic AAV serotypes. The AAV genome consists of two genetic sequences: a "Rep" gene that encodes for certain viral life-cycle proteins, and a "Cap" gene that encodes for proteins that form the viral capsid, which is the outer wall of the AAV. Recombinant AAV vectors can be created by combining the Rep sequence for one AAV serotype with the Cap sequence for a different AAV serotype. For example, a recombinant AAV 2/5 vector contains the AAV2 Rep sequence packaged within an AAV5 capsid. Because different capsid proteins have different transduction capabilities within different cell and tissue types, the selection of the capsid serotype is an important consideration in constructing an AAV gene therapy product.
One of the primary limitations with AAV gene therapy is AAV's packaging capacity: an AAV vector can hold only up to approximately 4,700 base pairs of DNA, whereas the genes for a number of IRDs, such as the CEP290 gene implicated in LCA10 and the ABCA4 gene implicated in STGD1, exceed that size. A possible solution to the size limitation would be to develop a "minigene" form of transgene that would be small enough to fit within the packaging capacity of AAV, but large enough for the resulting protein to maintain its function. Another potential limitation for AAV and other viral vector gene therapies is the potential to trigger an immune response. Because many types of AAV are naturally occurring, gene therapy patients may have built up neutralizing antibodies to specific AAV serotypes prior to gene therapy administration, which may result in an inflammatory immune response and tissue damage. The safety profile of AAV, however, is well-documented, and furthermore, the relative isolation of the human eye and ocular immune system within the body may mitigate the potential immune response from the administration of AAV into the eye. Our current gene therapy programs, which are described in further detail below, use AAV vectors for delivery of the genetic cargo to cells within the retina. 
RHO-adRP Product Candidate
In June 2018, we entered into an exclusive global license agreement with UFRF and Penn for rights to develop and commercialize a novel AAV gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of RHO-adRP. There are over 150 known mutations in the rhodopsin gene that can result in RHO-adRP. In individuals with RHO-adRP, the rhodopsin that is produced by the mutant gene is toxic. The construct for our RHO-adRP product candidate combines in a single AAV2/5 vector:

• | a transgene for a highly-efficient, novel short hairpin RNA, or shRNA, designed to target and "knockdown" production of the subject's innate rhodopsin, regardless of the specific mutation a subject has, with a


• | a transgene for a healthy rhodopsin protein that is resistant to the shRNA.

Our RHO-adRP construct was tested by investigators at Penn in a naturally occurring canine model of RHO-adRP, resulting in long term, i.e., over 8 months, anatomic and functional preservation of the photoreceptors, which was demonstrated with histology and electrophysiology. The investigators had initially tested a dual vector construct in which the shRNA and the healthy rhodopsin transgenes were delivered by different AAV vectors. The investigators found, however, that the dual vector approach caused inflammation and other complications in the retina, leading the investigators to develop this single vector construct. The results from these experiments were published by scientists at Penn and the University of Florida in PNAS in August 2018 in a paper titled: "Mutation-independent Rhodopsin Gene Therapy by Knockdown and Replacement with a Single AAV Vector." 
16


In addition to the exclusive license agreement, we also entered into a master sponsored research agreement with Penn, facilitated by the Penn Center for Innovation, or PCI, in June 2018, pursuant to which we, together with Penn, are conducting additional preclinical studies of the RHO-adRP product candidate and a natural history study of RHO-adRP patients. 
In parallel with the sponsored research, we have commenced IND-enabling activities for the RHO-adRP product candidate, including manufacturing for preclinical toxicology studies. We have engaged a CDMO for preclinical and Phase 1/2 clinical supply of our RHO-adRP product candidate. Based on current timelines and subject to regulatory review, we expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for this product candidate during 2020. 
Bestrophinopathies Program
In October 2018, we entered into an exclusive option agreement, or the Best Option Agreement, with Penn and UFRF, under which Penn and UFRF granted us an option to acquire an exclusive, global license to develop and commercialize novel AAV gene therapy product candidates for the treatment of Best disease and other bestrophinopathies. Investigators at Penn and UFRF tested the lead construct in a naturally occurring autosomal recessive canine bestrophinopathy model, resulting in the reversal of subretinal lesions and micro-detachments associated with the canine bestrophinopathy. The results of this work were published in PNAS in February 2018 in a paper titled: "BEST1 gene therapy corrects a diffuse retina-wide microdetachment modulated by light exposure." We believe the results from these experiments in a naturally occurring canine bestrophinopathy model with distinct phenotypic similarities to human Best disease demonstrate the potential therapeutic benefit of the BEST1 gene therapy product candidates from Penn and UFRF. 
In addition to the Best Option Agreement, we also entered into a master sponsored research agreement with Penn (which is separate from the master sponsored research agreement for our RHO-adRP product candidate), facilitated by PCI, pursuant to which we, together with Penn, are conducting additional preclinical studies of a product candidate from this program as well as natural history studies of patients with bestrophinopathies. 
In parallel with the sponsored research, we are planning to commence IND-enabling activities for a product candidate from this program, including manufacturing for preclinical toxicology studies. We have recently engaged a CDMO as the manufacturer for preclinical and Phase 1/2 clinical supply of this product candidate. Based on current timelines and subject to regulatory review and execution of a definitive license agreement with Penn and UFRF, we expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for a product candidate from this program during 2021. 
University of Massachusetts Medical School Research (LCA10 and STGD1; Gene Delivery Methods)
In February 2018, we entered into two sponsored research agreements with UMMS to utilize a "minigene" approach to create AAV gene therapy product candidates targeting LCA10 and STGD1. The "minigene" approach may offer a potential solution for diseases that would otherwise be difficult to address through conventional AAV gene replacement therapy where the size of the transgene exceeds the packaging capacity of conventional AAV vectors. We also entered into a separate sponsored research agreement with UMMS to evaluate various AAV gene delivery methods for potential application in the eye. UMMS has granted us an option to obtain an exclusive license to any patents or patent applications that result from these sponsored research programs.
LCA10 is caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene. The naturally occurring CEP290 gene is approximately 8,000 base pairs. In a January 2018 publication in Human Gene Therapy, researchers at UMMS demonstrated that injection of a CEP290 minigene into a newborn mice model for LCA10 resulting in rescue of photoreceptor cells, as evidenced by both anatomical and functional measures. Currently, UMMS is evaluating other CEP290 minigene fragments and promoters for potential enhanced efficacy and we expect to receive results during 2019, at which point we may elect to exercise our option to in-license the LCA10 program. 
STGD1 is caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene. The size of the naturally occurring ABCA4 gene is approximately 7,000 base pairs. UMMS plans to construct and evaluate several ABCA4 minigene fragments to be tested in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. 
Manufacturing
We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of Zimura, our HtrA1 inhibitors, our RHO-adRP product candidate, the BEST1 product candidates for which we have an option from Penn and UFRF, or any other product candidate we may develop. Although we rely and intend to continue to rely upon third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our products and product candidates, we have personnel 
17


with experience to manage the third-party CMOs that we have engaged or may engage to produce our product candidates. We do not have any long-term supply arrangements other than as described below.
Manufacturing of pharmaceutical and biological products is a process that generally involves procurement of starting materials, such as raw materials, chemical or biological synthesis in controlled environments and post-production testing and analysis before the product can be released. Manufacturing processes can be complex and difficult to develop, especially for biological products such as gene therapies. Even when a manufacturing process is successfully developed, there are challenges associated with scaling up a manufacturing process to produce quantities sufficient for clinical trials or potential commercial sales and producing high-quality materials consistently using a clearly defined manufacturing process. The manufacture of pharmaceutical and biological products is subject to FDA review and oversight. Having a well-defined and validated manufacturing process is crucial to obtaining FDA approval of any product candidate we may bring forward.
Zimura Manufacturing
The process for manufacturing Zimura consists of chemical synthesis, pegylation, purification and finally freeze drying to form a powder, which is the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API. Each of these steps involves a relatively common chemical engineering process. In a separate process that follows the freeze drying, the Zimura API is dissolved in a liquid solution that includes certain chemical buffers and then is asceptically filtered into vials from which the intravitreal injection solution is drawn. This process of rendering the API into a liquid solution and placing it into vials is referred to as fill/finish services.
We currently rely upon a single third-party manufacturer, Agilent Technologies, Inc., or Agilent, to supply us with API for Zimura and a different, single third-party manufacturer, Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services (formerly Althea, Inc.), or Ajinomoto, to provide fill/finish services for Zimura. We currently obtain Zimura API from Agilent on a purchase order basis. We have entered into a clinical and commercial services agreement with Ajinomoto for fill/finish services for Zimura. This agreement is summarized below. We obtain the PEG reagent used to make Zimura API from a single third-party manufacturer on a purchase order basis. 
Ajinomoto Clinical and Commercial Services Agreement 
In October 2016, we and Ajinomoto entered into a Clinical and Commercial Services Agreement, which we refer to as the Fill/Finish Services Agreement. Pursuant to the Fill/Finish Services Agreement, Ajinomoto agreed to provide clinical and commercial fill/finish services for Zimura as well as any future product candidates that we and Ajinomoto may mutually agree. The Fill/Finish Services Agreement has an initial term that will expire at the end of 2027, absent termination by either party in accordance with the terms of the Fill/Finish Services Agreement. The initial term of the Fill/Finish Services Agreement may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. The amount payable by us to Ajinomoto under the Fill/Finish Services Agreement is based on the volume of finished drug product that we order, subject to periodic adjustments over the term of the Fill/Finish Services Agreement. In addition, in the event that we order a specified volume of product, Ajinomoto agreed to supply biological or pharmaceutical drug products meeting certain parameters exclusively to us.
We may cancel any purchase order under the Fill/Finish Services Agreement at any time, subject to the payment of specified cancellation fees. We may terminate the Fill/Finish Services Agreement, without cause, as of any date following the third anniversary of the effective date upon six months’ prior notice to Ajinomoto. Each party also has the right to terminate the Fill/Finish Services Agreement for other customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy.
The Fill/Finish Services Agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Ajinomoto with current Good Manufacturing Practices, cooperation by Ajinomoto in connection with marketing applications for our product candidates, indemnification, confidentiality, dispute resolution and other customary matters for an agreement of this kind.
Gene Therapy Manufacturing
The manufacture of AAV gene therapies requires the use of high quality reagents and substrates as starting materials, such as plasmids and cells. Plasmids are circular double-stranded DNA sequences that exist separate and apart from a cell's chromosomes and which can be engineered to encode for a specific promoter-transgene combination or a specific AAV Rep-Cap combination. Cell lines that are free of microbial contamination are selected to ensure the safety and quality of the final, produced AAV vector. The plasmids and cell lines are generally sourced from a limited number of qualified suppliers.
The process for producing AAV vectors typically consists of plasmid transfection of an appropriate cell line. In this step, specifically-designed plasmids are inserted into living cells, where the AAV Rep-Cap genes are expressed using the cell's 
18


existing machinery. Empty virus capsids are then synthesized and packaged together with the promoter-transgene combination sequence. The subsequent purification process is comprised of steps that clear host cell impurities present in the harvested material and that aid in the removal of empty virus capsids from AAV vectors containing the promoter-transgene combination sequence.  Each of these closely monitored purification steps involves a relatively common biochemical engineering process.  The resulting purified suspension of AAV vectors is considered the drug substance for AAV gene therapies.  In a separate process that follows formulation and purification, the AAV drug substance is fill/finished into vials from which the injection solution is drawn.

                We have engaged a gene therapy CDMO for preclinical and Phase 1/2 clinical supply of our RHO-adRP drug product candidate. We have recently engaged a CDMO for preclinical and Phase 1/2 clinical supply of the BEST1 gene therapy drug product candidate for which we are planning to commence IND-enabling studies.
Sales and Marketing
We expect that our commercial strategy for any of our product candidates, including whether to retain commercial rights and market and sell the product candidate ourselves or to utilize collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements with third parties in some or all geographic markets, will be determined based on a variety of factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the disease area, the particular indication for which the product candidate is approved, the territory in which the product candidate may be marketed and the commercial potential for such product candidate. We are developing Zimura and our HtrA1 inhibitor program for GA secondary to dry AMD, which is a condition affecting a relatively large number of individuals, and we are also developing Zimura for STGD1, which is a condition affecting a much more limited number of individuals. Our gene therapy programs are currently being developed for orphan IRDs with a limited number of affected individuals. If any of our product candidates are approved, the size and nature of the affected patient population will be an important factor in our commercial strategy. 
In addition, our commercial strategy will vary depending on whether the disease is typically treated by general ophthalmology practitioners, specialists, such as retina specialists, or other sub-specialists. For example, in the United States, retina specialists perform most of the medical procedures involving diseases of the back of the eye. Intravitreal injection and subretinal injection are specialized procedures. In the vast majority of cases in the United States, retina specialists perform intravitreal injections and highly specialized retina surgeons perform subretinal injections. We believe that retina specialists and retina surgeons in the United States are sufficiently concentrated such that we could effectively promote an approved product candidate to these specialists with a targeted specialty sales and marketing group. For example, retina specialists who see patients with IRDs, as well as their patients, are generally concentrated in a limited number of large, academic research institutions located throughout the United States. 
Competition
The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our product candidates from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as generic and biosimilar companies, worldwide. There are a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are currently developing product candidates for the treatment of GA, Stargardt disease, RHO-adRP and LCA10, and there is at least one biotechnology company that is currently developing a product candidate for the treatment of Best disease. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. We also will face similar competition with respect to any products or product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. In particular, many companies are pursuing gene therapy approaches for orphan and age-related retinal diseases. 
Based on publicly available information, we are aware of the following research and development programs that may be competitive with programs we are pursuing. Other competitive programs may exist of which we are not aware. 
Competitive considerations for Dry AMD and GA: 

• | There are a number of products in preclinical research and clinical development by third parties to treat dry AMD, including several that are in development for GA secondary to dry AMD. In general, these product candidates can be categorized based on their proposed mechanisms of action. The mechanisms of action for these product candidates

19


include inflammation suppression, such as complement system inhibitors and corticosteroids, visual cycle modulators, antioxidants and neuroprotectants, cell and gene therapies and vascular perfusion enhancers. We are aware that Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Roche AG, Novartis AG and MorphoSys AG, Hemera Biosciences, Inc., Gyroscope Therapeutics, Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. each have complement inhibitors in development for dry AMD. We believe that the most advanced of these programs is Apellis's pegylated, synthetic peptide targeting complement protein C3. Following positive Phase 2 results for its C3 complement inhibitor product candidate, Apellis announced in September 2018 that it had dosed the first patient in a Phase 3 program for this product candidate. If Apellis's Phase 3 program for its C3 complement inhibitor product candidate is successful, it is likely that Apellis may obtain marketing approval for its product candidate in advance of when we could reasonably expect marketing approval for Zimura in GA or a product candidate from our HtrA1 inhibitor program in GA, if at all. Moreover, we are aware that several other companies have announced development programs for the treatment of dry AMD or GA targeting different mechanisms of action outside of the complement system.
Competitive considerations for Stargardt disease:

• | There are a number of products in preclinical research and clinical development by third parties to treat Stargardt disease. We are aware that Sanofi, Acucela Inc., Alkeus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Vision Medicines, Inc., Lin BioScience, Inc., Nightstar Therapeutics plc, ProQR Therapeutics N.V., Spark Therapeutics and Generation Bio Co. each have research or development programs in Stargardt disease. Four of these programs, Acucela, Alkeus, Vision Medicines and Lin BioScience, are exploring the use of oral therapeutics, while Sanofi, with technology provided by Oxford BioMedica plc, Nightstar and Spark are each using a gene therapy approach and ProQR is using an RNA-based approach. Acucela’s product candidate is in Phase 3 development while Alkeus’s and Sanofi’s product candidates are each in Phase 2 development. Spark's program is in the research phase. In addition, several academic organizations have early stage programs in Stargardt disease. 

Competitive considerations for RHO-adRP:

• | There are a number of products in preclinical research by third parties to treat RHO-adRP. We are aware that multiple academic institutions have early stage gene therapy development programs in RHO-adRP. In addition, Nightstar Therapeutics plc has a preclinical AAV gene therapy program in RHO-adRP and ProQR Therapeutics N.V. is developing an early stage RNA-based therapeutic for RHO-adRP. 

Competitive considerations for Best disease:

• | We are aware that Nightstar Therapeutics plc has a preclinical AAV gene therapy program in Best disease.

Competitive considerations for LCA10:

• | We are aware that Editas Medicine has a CRISPR gene editing program for LCA10, an IND for which was submitted in late 2018, ProQR Therapeutics N.V. is developing an RNA-based therapeutic for LCA10 that is currently in clinical development, and Generation Bio Co. has a preclinical program that utilizes ceDNA technology to target LCA10. In addition, several academic institutions have preclinical programs in LCA10.

Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position, among other methods and where patent protection is available, by filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business, and by maintaining our issued patents. For our collaborative gene therapy sponsored research programs, we are generally relying on our university collaborators to generate research and data to support new patent applications, and to file, prosecute and maintain any patents or patent applications resulting from the sponsored research. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
20


Our patent portfolio includes the following: 

• | patents and patent applications in-licensed from Archemix Corp., or Archemix:


• | composition-of-matter patents covering Zimura, which have issued in the United States, the European Union, Japan and certain other jurisdictions, and which are expected to expire in Japan in 2026 and elsewhere in 2025; and composition-of-matter patent applications covering Zimura, which are pending in certain other jurisdictions, and which, if granted, are expected to expire in 2025; and


• | patents covering the treatment of certain complement mediated disorders with Zimura, Zimura for use in a method of treating certain complement mediated disorders or a composition comprising Zimura for treating certain complement mediated disorders, which have issued in the United States, the European Union, Japan and certain other jurisdictions, and which are expected to expire in the United States and Japan in 2026 and elsewhere in 2025; and


• | patents and patent applications owned by Ophthotech:


• | patent applications covering formulations, methods of use for treating Stargardt disease, and other proprietary technology relating to Zimura, which are pending in the United States, the European Union, Japan and certain other jurisdictions, and which, if granted, are expected to expire in 2034; and


• | patents and patent applications owned by our Orion subsidiary:


• | three families of composition-of-matter patent applications covering the lead and backup compounds in our HtrA1 inhibitor program, which are pending in the United States, the European Union, Japan and certain other jurisdictions, and which, if granted, are expected to expire in 2037; and


• | patents and patent applications in-licensed from UFRF and Penn:


• | two families of composition-of-matter and method-of-treatment patent applications relating to the proprietary RHO-adRP AAV technology of UFRF and Penn, which are pending in the United States, the European Union, Japan and certain other jurisdictions, and which, if granted, are expected to expire in 2037 or 2039.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent or patent application claims patentably indistinct subject matter as another commonly owned patent or patent application having an earlier expiration date and the patentee terminally disclaims the portion of the term beyond such earlier expiration date. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is undergoing clinical development or under regulatory review while the patent is in force. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended.
Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. The expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us. See "—Government Regulation and Product Approvals" below for a description of market exclusivity mechanisms that may be available to us.
We may rely, in some circumstances, upon trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
21


Licensing and Other Arrangements
We are party to a number of license, acquisition and other agreements that have granted us rights to develop our product candidates and conduct our research and development programs. These agreements generally impose license fee, milestone payment, royalty payment and diligence obligations on us. Our material in-license and acquisition agreements are described below. 
In the future, we may enter into additional acquisition or license agreements, particularly if we choose to acquire or in-license additional products, product candidates or other technologies and expand our product pipeline. We expect that any future acquisition or license agreements would impose similar obligations on us. In the future, we may also enter into agreements to out-license intellectual property to our collaboration and research partners to assist in the development and, if approved, commercialization of our product candidates. For example, as we continue to develop our portfolio and evaluate our overall strategic priorities, we may out-license certain rights to Zimura if we believe the arrangement could assist us in the development or potential commercialization of Zimura and would otherwise help us pursue our business plan and strategic goals. 
Zimura - Archemix C5 License Agreement
In September 2011, we entered into an amended and restated exclusive license agreement with Archemix relating to anti-C5 aptamers, which we refer to as the C5 License Agreement. The C5 License Agreement superseded a July 2007 agreement between us and Archemix. Under the C5 License Agreement, we hold exclusive worldwide licenses, subject to certain pre–existing rights, under specified patents and technology owned or controlled by Archemix to develop, make, use, sell, offer for sale, distribute for sale, import and export pharmaceutical products comprised of or derived from an anti-C5 aptamer for the prevention, treatment, cure or control of human indications, diseases, disorders or conditions of the eye, adnexa of the eye, orbit and optic nerve, other than certain expressly excluded applications.
Financial Terms
In connection with the C5 License Agreement, as amended, we paid Archemix an upfront licensing fee of $1.0 million and issued to Archemix an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of our series A-1 preferred stock and 500,000 shares of our series B-1 preferred stock. We have also paid Archemix an aggregate of $2.0 million in fees based on our achievement of specified clinical milestone events under the C5 License Agreement. 
Under the C5 License Agreement, for each anti-C5 aptamer product that we may develop under the agreement, including Zimura, we are obligated to make additional payments to Archemix of up to an aggregate of $57.5 million if we achieve specified development, clinical and regulatory milestones, with $30.5 million of such payments relating to a first indication, $24.5 million of such payments relating to second and third indications and $2.5 million of such payments relating to sustained delivery applications. Under the C5 License Agreement, we are also obligated to make additional payments to Archemix of up to an aggregate of $22.5 million if we achieve specified commercial milestones based on net product sales of all anti-C5 products licensed under the agreement. We are also obligated to pay Archemix a double-digit percentage of specified non-royalty payments we may receive from any sublicensee of our rights under the C5 License Agreement. We are not obligated to pay Archemix a running royalty based on net product sales in connection with the C5 License Agreement.
Diligence Obligations
We are required to exercise commercially reasonable efforts in developing and commercializing at least one anti-C5 aptamer product and in undertaking actions required to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to market such product in the United States, the European Union, and Japan, and in such other markets where we determine that it is commercially reasonable to do so.
Term and Termination
Unless earlier terminated, the C5 License Agreement will expire upon the latest of 12 years after the first commercial sale in any country of the last licensed product, the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patents that covers a licensed product, and the date on which no further payments of sublicensing income are to be received by us.
Either we or Archemix may terminate the C5 License Agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and the breach remains uncured for a specified period. Archemix may also terminate the C5 License Agreement, or may convert our exclusive license under the agreement to a non-exclusive license, if we challenge or assist a third party in challenging the 
22


validity or enforceability of any of the patents licensed under the agreement. We may terminate the agreement at any time and for any or no reason effective at the end of a specified period following our written notice of termination to Archemix.
HtrA1 Inhibitor Program - Inception 4 Merger Agreement
In October 2018, we and Inception 4 entered into an agreement and plan of merger, which we refer to as the Inception 4 Merger Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired Inception 4 through a merger transaction, referred to as the Inception 4 Merger.  Prior to the Inception 4 Merger, Inception 4 was a privately held biotechnology company focused on the research and development of small molecule inhibitors of HtrA1 for age-related retinal diseases in humans.
As upfront consideration for the Inception 4 Merger, the former equityholders of Inception 4 received 5,044,201 shares of our common stock, and in December 2018, they received an additional 130,526 shares of our common stock following finalization of customary post-closing adjustments.  As part of the transaction, we received approximately $6.1 million in cash.
Contingent Consideration
In addition, pursuant to the Inception 4 Merger Agreement, the former equityholders of Inception 4 will be entitled to receive contingent future payments from us based on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones of up to an aggregate maximum amount of $105 million, with $45 million of such potential payments relating to GA and $60 million of such potential payments relating to wet AMD.  These future milestone payments will be payable in the form of shares of our common stock, calculated based on the price of our common stock over a five-trading day period preceding the achievement of the relevant milestone, unless and until the issuance of such shares would, together with all other shares issued in connection with the Inception 4 Merger, exceed an overall maximum limit of approximately 7.2 million shares, which is equal to 19.9% of the number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock as of the close of business on the business day prior to the closing date of the Inception 4 Merger, and will be payable in cash thereafter.
Diligence Obligation
We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the activities described in an agreed-upon development plan outlining certain activities for developing at least one HtrA1 inhibitor for the treatment of GA.  Our maximum aggregate liability for any and all breaches of our obligation under the Inception 4 Merger Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop an HtrA1 inhibitor is limited to $5 million.
Other Terms and Conditions
The Inception 4 Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of Inception 4 and Ophthotech. The representations and warranties generally will survive until the first anniversary of the closing date, with certain specified representations and warranties surviving to 30 months after the closing date and other specified representations and warranties surviving to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The Inception 4 Merger Agreement also contains customary indemnification provisions whereby the former equityholders of Inception 4 will indemnify us and certain affiliated parties for any losses arising out of breaches of the representations, warranties and covenants of Inception 4 under the Inception 4 Merger Agreement; pre-closing tax matters; appraisal claims of former Inception 4 stockholders; any pre-closing indebtedness or expenses not previously adjusted for at the closing; fraud with respect to representations and warranties of Inception 4; and certain other matters.
RHO-adRP Gene Therapy Product Candidate - License Agreement with UFRF and Penn
In June 2018, we entered into an exclusive global license agreement with UFRF and Penn, which we refer to as the RHO-adRP License Agreement. Under the RHO-adRP License Agreement, UFRF and Penn granted us a worldwide, exclusive license under specified patent rights and a worldwide, non-exclusive license under specified know-how, including specified preclinical data, to manufacture, develop and commercialize certain AAV gene therapy products for the treatment of rhodopsin-mediated diseases. The rights granted under the RHO-adRP License Agreement included certain patent rights covering a novel AAV gene therapy product candidate intended to treat RHO-adRP.
We may grant sublicenses of the licensed patent rights and know-how without the consent of the UFRF and Penn to certain affiliates and to biopharmaceutical companies that have a minimum market capitalization at the time such sublicense is granted and may otherwise grant sublicenses of the licensed patent rights and know-how with the consent of UFRF and Penn, not to be unreasonably withheld. 
Diligence Obligations
We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue an agreed-upon development plan with the intent to develop a licensed product for sale within at least the United States and two major European countries and, subject to obtaining 
23


marketing approval, to commercialize a licensed product in at least the United States and two major European countries. In addition, we agreed to meet specified development and commercial milestones with respect to a licensed product by specified dates, as the same may be extended under the terms of the RHO-adRP License Agreement. 
Financial Terms
In June 2018, we paid a $0.5 million upfront license issuance fee in connection with entry into the agreement, as well as accrued patent prosecution expenses of approximately $30 thousand. Under the agreement, we agreed to pay an annual license maintenance fee in the low double-digit thousands of dollars, which will be payable on an annual basis until the first commercial sale of a licensed product. In addition, we agreed to reimburse UFRF for the costs and expenses of patent prosecution and maintenance related to the licensed patent rights.
We further agreed to pay UFRF, on behalf of both licensors, up to an aggregate of $23.5 million if we achieve specified clinical, marketing approval and reimbursement approval milestones with respect to a licensed product and additionally, up to an aggregate of $70.0 million if we achieve specified commercial sales milestones with respect to a licensed product.
We are also obligated to pay UFRF, on behalf of both licensors, royalties at a low single-digit percentage of net sales of licensed products. Such royalties are subject to customary reductions for lack of patent coverage and loss of regulatory exclusivity. In addition, such royalties with respect to any licensed product in any country may be offset by a specified portion of any royalty payments actually paid by us with respect to such licensed product in such country under third-party licenses for patent rights or other intellectual property rights that are necessary to manufacture, develop and commercialize the licensed product in such country. Our obligation to pay royalties under the RHO-adRP License Agreement will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest of: 

• | the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent rights covering a licensed product in the country of sale;


• | the expiration of regulatory exclusivity covering a licensed product in the country of sale; and


• | ten years from the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the country of sale.

Beginning on the earlier of the calendar year following the first commercial sale of a licensed product and the first business day of 2031, we are also obligated to pay certain minimum royalties, not to exceed an amount in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars on an annual basis, which minimum royalties are creditable against our royalty obligation with respect to net sales of licensed products due for the year in which the minimum royalty is paid. 
If we or an affiliate sublicenses any of the licensed patent rights to a third party, we will be obligated to pay UFRF, on behalf of both licensors, a low double-digit percentage of the consideration received in exchange for such sublicense, with the applicable percentage based upon the stage of development of the sublicensed product at the time we or the applicable affiliate enters into the sublicense. 
If we receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher from the FDA in connection with obtaining marketing approval for a licensed product and we subsequently use such priority review voucher in connection with a different product candidate, we will be obligated to pay UFRF, on behalf of both licensors, aggregate payments in the low double-digit millions of dollars based on certain marketing approval and commercial sales milestones with respect to such other product candidate. In addition, if we sell such a priority review voucher to a third party, we will be obligated to pay UFRF, on behalf of both licensors, a low double-digit percentage of any consideration received from such third party in connection with such sale. 
Term and Termination
Unless earlier terminated by us, the RHO-adRP License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties to UFRF on net sales of licensed products. We may terminate the agreement at any time for any reason upon prior written notice to UFRF. Penn or UFRF may terminate the agreement if we materially breach the agreement and do not cure such breach within a specified cure period, if we experience a specified insolvency event, if we cease to carry on the entirety of our business related to the licensed patent rights, if we cease for more than four consecutive quarters to make any payment of earned royalties on net sales of licensed products following the commencement of commercialization thereof, unless such cessation is based on safety concerns that we are actively attempting to address, or if we or an affiliate challenges or assists a third party in challenging the validity, scope, patentability, and/or enforceability of the licensed patent rights. 
Following any termination of the agreement prior to expiration of the term of the agreement, all rights to the licensed patent rights and know-how granted to us will revert to UFRF and Penn.

Government Regulation and Product Approvals
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other legal requirements of regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Review and Approval of Drugs and Biologics in the United States
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Biologic products, including gene therapy products, are licensed for marketing under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA. The failure to comply with requirements under the FDCA or PHSA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities, including state agencies.
A drug candidate must be approved by the FDA through a new drug application, or NDA. A biologic candidate is licensed by the FDA through approval of a biologic license application, or BLA. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new product in the United States must typically undertake the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated at that clinical site;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication for which the sponsor is seeking approval and the safety, potency and purity of a candidate biologic product for each indication for which the sponsor is seeking approval;


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an application requesting marketing approval for one or more proposed indications;


• | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;


• | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the application; and


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.

25


Preclinical Studies
Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, and the purity and stability of the substance, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations.
The IND and IRB Processes
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved application. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and re-approve the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by the sponsor based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human Clinical Trials in Support of an Application
Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or, in certain indications, including those for which we are developing product candidates, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage. 


• | Phase 2. The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Phase 2a clinical trials tend to be smaller pilot studies for the 

26


purpose of demonstrating biological activity and clinical "proof of concept." Phase 2b studies tend to be larger studies focused on finding the optimal dosage and may be controlled.

• | Phase 3. These clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which denotes a study that presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a product candidate. The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, identify adverse effects, establish the overall risk–benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 


• | Phase 4. Post-approval studies may be required to be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 

Progress reports detailing the safety results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate; and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The FDA, the sponsor or the DSMB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the sponsor or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis in certain circumstances. 
In addition, the Right to Try Act, signed into law in May 2018, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
Special Regulations and Guidance Governing Gene Therapy Products
The FDA has defined a gene therapy product as one that mediates its effects by transcription and/or translation of transferred genetic material and/or by integrating into the host genome and which is administered as nucleic acids, viruses, or genetically engineered microorganisms. The products may be used to modify cells in vivo or transferred to cells ex vivo prior to administration to the recipient. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (OTAT), and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. CBER works closely with the Local Biosafety Board, a federal advisory committee, in reviewing proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols and engaging in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical, and societal issues related to those protocols. The NIH and the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, a federal advisory committee, also advise the FDA on gene therapy issues and other issues related to emerging technologies. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. 
The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, including draft guidance documents released in July 2018 relating to gene therapies for human retinal disorders and gene therapies for rare diseases, and on January 15, 2019, the FDA issued a statement that it would issue additional guidance to facilitate the development of gene therapy products. Although the FDA has indicated that these guidance documents are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance with them is likely necessary to gain approval for any gene therapy product candidate we may develop. The guidance documents provide additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things, the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing, and control information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to 
27


investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire.
If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving the NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, a protocol and related documentation must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA. In addition, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH will convene the RAC to discuss protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public.
Further, to facilitate adverse event reporting and dissemination of additional information about gene therapy trials, the FDA and the NIH established the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, or GeMCRIS. Investigators and sponsors of human gene transfer trials can utilize this web-based system to report serious adverse events and to provide annual reports. GeMCRIS also allows members of the public to access basic reports about human gene transfer trials registered with the NIH and to search for information such as trial location, the names of investigators conducting trials, and the names of gene transfer products being studied.
Finally, for a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with good tissue practices, or GTP. These standards are found in FDA regulations and guidances that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing.
Review of a Product Candidate by the FDA
If clinical trials are successful, the next step in the development process is the preparation and submission to the FDA of an application. The application is the vehicle through which applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new drug for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. The application must contain a description of the manufacturing process and quality control methods, as well as results of preclinical tests, toxicology studies, clinical trials and proposed labeling, among other things. Every new product must be the subject of an approved application before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most applications is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2019 is $2,588,478 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2019 is $309,915. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
Following submission of an application, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of an application generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to specified performance goals and timelines in the review process of applications, which goals and timelines depend on the type of product candidate for which review is sought and whether the sponsor has applied for and received from the FDA special review status for the particular product candidate allowing for expedited review. Special review status is available for certain products that are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life–threatening disease or condition under one of the following FDA-designations: fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
Before approving an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured, stored, packaged and tested. These pre–approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an 
28


application submission, including component manufacturing (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an application, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. 
In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a New Molecular Entity.
The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel product candidate to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an application or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Product Administration Safety and Innovation Act in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the submission of the assessment data required under PREA. These plans are subject to FDA review prior to commencement of the pediatric study. Product candidates that have received orphan designation are generally exempt from the requirements of PREA. In addition, a sponsor may apply for a waiver of the PREA requirements, which the FDA has indicated it will automatically grant for certain diseases that do not affect pediatric populations, such as age-related macular degeneration.
The FDA’s Decision on an Application
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the application, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the product candidate’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post–market studies or surveillance programs. 
Post-Approval Requirements
Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, or changing the manufacturing process for the approved product, are subject to additional testing and/or FDA review and approval. 
In addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any 
29


third–party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, sponsors and manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Further, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may restrict, suspend or withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. 
Generic Drugs and Exclusivity
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, the FDA is authorized to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs, which are also known as reference listed drugs, or RLDs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the FDA. An ANDA applicant does not generally rely on its own preclinical or clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness but instead can rely on preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted by the sponsor of the RLD. The ANDA applicant must show that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to a number of factors, including the active ingredient, and that the generic version is "bioequivalent" to the RLD. Physicians, pharmacists and third-party payors generally consider an approved generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. 
Sponsors of RLDs are required to list in the FDA's Orange Bank each patent with claims covering the RLD or approved methods of using the RLD. An ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any such patents, which may be a certification that the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product, which is known as a Paragraph IV certification. An ANDA applicant that makes a Paragraph IV certification must notify the sponsor of the RLD, who may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of a Paragraph IV certification notice prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earliest of 30 months after receipt of the Paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain drug applications for competing products, including generic drugs. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a New Chemical Entity. A drug is a New Chemical Entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, or an 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. 
The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. The five-year and three-year exclusivities will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. As of January 1, 2019, the FDA has approved 16 biosimilar products for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars, as described below, have been approved. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Additional guidances are expected to be finalized by FDA in the near term.
Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as "interchangeable" with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and for products administered multiple times, that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
A patent claiming a new drug product or its method of use may be eligible for a limited patent term extension, also known as patent term restoration, under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. Patent term extension is generally available only for drug products whose active ingredient has not previously been approved by the FDA. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a marketing approval application, plus the time between the submission date of a marketing approval application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term extension cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an application for the product and rare disease or condition. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee.
If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different indications. In particular, the concept of what constitutes a "same product" for purposes of orphan drug exclusivity is unclear in the context of gene therapies, and the FDA has issued draft guidance 
31


suggesting minor variations in the construct of a gene therapy that lead to improvements in safety or efficacy may result in the determination that a drug is a "different product". If a product designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety or provides a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. This outcome is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority.
Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or patent protection, including the non-patent and orphan drug exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an application sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection covering the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA that references the product. With regard to patents, the six-month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents for which an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant submitted a paragraph IV certification, unless the NDA sponsor or patent owner first obtains a court determination that the patent is valid and infringed by the proposed ANDA or 505(b)(2) product.
Review and Approval of Products in Europe and other Foreign Jurisdictions
In addition to regulations in the United States, a manufacturer is subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions to the extent it chooses to conduct clinical trials or sell any products in those foreign countries. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational product in the European Union, a manufacturer must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the EMA. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, clinical trials are to be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Clinical Trial Approval in the European Union
Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of the European Union Member State, or the EU Member State, in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the applicable ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion.
In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new legislation aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial to be conducted in more than one EU Member State will only be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials. As of January 1, 2019, the website of the European Commission reported that the implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation was dependent on the development of a fully functional clinical trials portal and database, which would be confirmed by an independent audit, and that the new legislation would come into effect six months after the European Commission publishes a notice of this confirmation.

Marketing Authorization
In the European Union, marketing authorizations for medicinal products may be obtained through different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process. A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. As in the United States, marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of approved medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States both before and after grant of the marketing authorizations.
Centralized Procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across the European Economic Area, i.e. the European Union as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. It is optional for those products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is not in the interest of patients. 
Specialized Procedures for Gene Therapies. The grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for gene therapy products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC includes specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision, and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to the EMA, which provides an opinion regarding the MAA. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by the EMA.
Decentralized Procedure. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other concerned EU Member States of an assessment of an MAA conducted by one EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State. In accordance with this procedure, an applicant submits an MAA to the reference EU Member State and the concerned EU Member States. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. Following receipt of a valid application, the reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States which must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. 
If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. Authorization in accordance with the decentralized procedure will result in authorization of the medicinal product only in the reference EU Member State and in the other concerned EU Member States.
Mutual Recognition Procedure. In accordance with the mutual recognition procedure, the sponsor applies for national marketing authorization in one EU Member State. Upon receipt of this authorization the sponsor can then seek the recognition of this authorization by other EU Member States. 
Periods of Authorization and Renewals in the European Union
A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the relevant EU Member State. To seek renewal, at least six months prior to expiration of the marketing authorization, the holder must provide the EMA or the EU Member State with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the relevant competent authority of the EU Member State decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any marketing authorization that is not followed by the marketing of the medicinal product on the EU market, in the case of the centralized procedure, or on the market of the EU Member State which delivered the marketing authorization, in the case of the decentralized procedure, within three years after authorization ceases to be valid.
33


Regulatory Data Exclusivity in the European Union
In the European Union, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abridged) application for a period of eight years. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic MAA can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are shown to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the additional prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the European Union
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of: (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives the medicinal product is unlikely to be developed. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and, in addition, a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process, including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all EU Member States and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The PDCO may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA must determine that the applicant actually complied with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted via the centralized procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the Supplementary Protection Certificate.

Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom, or UK, voted in favor of leaving the European Union, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit”. Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw from the European Union. The process for withdrawal has been and remains uncertain and convoluted, with no withdrawal agreement between the government of the UK and the European Union concluded at this time. If no withdrawal agreement is reached by March 29, 2019, Brexit is currently scheduled to occur but without any transition mechanism in place. As the current regulatory framework for investigational medicines and approved products in the UK is derived from European Union directives and regulations, uncertainty regarding Brexit translates to uncertainty regarding the UK regulatory regime that will be applicable to our business following the scheduled March 29, 2019 Brexit effective date.
Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in many other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage for a particular indication to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for such indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the studies required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered by payors to be medically necessary or cost effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Moreover, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. 
The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of pharmaceutical products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including rebate programs, price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. For example, the Trump Administration has expressed an interest in authorizing and/or directing the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within HHS or other agencies of the U.S. government to negotiate prices for products covered by Medicare directly with pharmaceutical companies. If this were to occur, especially for AMD products, where a large portion of the patient population is elderly and is therefore covered by Medicare, there could be significant downward pressure on prices charged, not only for patients covered by Medicare, but also for patients covered by private insurers who may follow the government’s lead on price. In addition, in May 2018, the Trump Administration announced a plan that would include several initiatives designed to lower drug prices. Additional similar proposals from HHS and CMS have followed.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the

completion of additional cost effectiveness clinical studies. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or any of them may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union over the past decade. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. 
In addition to initiatives specifically directed at lowering or containing prescription drug prices, legislative action in the United States at the national level has resulted in reduced funding levels for Medicare. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 led to aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year beginning in 2013 through 2024, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Any reduction in healthcare, including Medicare, funding may affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
Moreover, the number of individuals covered by health insurance has a direct impact on the potential market for our product candidates, if approved. The ACA, passed in 2010, included the "individual mandate," which required most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance. Individuals who did not obtain required coverage were subjected to a penalty. The "individual mandate" was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, with the repeal becoming effective on January 1, 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. In addition, the Trump Administration has also taken executive actions that may impact the number of individuals in the United States that are covered by health insurance and the level of that coverage. For example, President Trump issued an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. In addition, CMS has proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, in June 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued the payments were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace and providers are not yet known.
Healthcare Law and Regulation
Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;

36



• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH, Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;


• | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti–kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non–governmental third–party payors, including private insurers.

Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
