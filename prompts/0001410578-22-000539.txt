Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
We are an innovative digital health business transforming care with hand-held, whole body ultrasound. Powered by our proprietary Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology, our solution enables the acquisition of imaging information from an affordable, powerful device that fits in a healthcare professional’s pocket with a unique combination of cloud-connected software and hardware technology that is easily accessed through a mobile app. Butterfly enables the practical application of ultrasound information into the clinical workflow.
​
Butterfly iQ+ is the only ultrasound transducer that can perform whole-body imaging in a single handheld probe using semiconductor technology. Our Ultrasound-on-Chip™ reduces the cost of manufacturing, while our software is intended to make the product easy to use, fully integrated with the clinical workflow and accessible on a user’s smartphone, tablet and almost any hospital computer system connected to the Internet. 
​
Through our portable proprietary, handheld solution, protected by a robust intellectual property portfolio and empowered in part by our proprietary software and Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), we aim to enable the delivery of imaging information with the least amount of effort, unlocking information and enabling more informed and earlier medical decisions no matter where clinical care takes place. In addition, Butterfly BlueprintTM provides a system-wide ultrasound platform with CompassTM software that integrates into a healthcare system’s clinical and administrative infrastructure to be able to deploy Butterfly iQ+, which we believe can help optimize care at scale across the full spectrum of departments and specialties in a healthcare system, including nursing. 
​
We market and sell the Butterfly system, which includes probes and related accessories and software subscriptions, to healthcare systems, physicians and healthcare providers through a direct sales force, distributors, strategic partners and our eCommerce channel. We generated total revenue of $62.6 million and $46.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We also incurred net losses of $32.9 million and $162.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. 
​
We employ approximately 463 employees as of December 31, 2021 and sell our products in approximately 30 countries through our sales force and independent distributors and directly to physicians through our eCommerce channel.
​
Corporate History and Information
​
The Company, formerly known as Longview Acquisition Corp. (“Longview”), was incorporated in Delaware on February 4, 2020. Prior to February 12, 2021, we were a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
​
On February 12, 2021 we completed the business combination (the “Business Combination”) pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, dated as of November 19, 2020 (the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among Longview, Clay Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”), and Butterfly Network, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Legacy Butterfly”). The transaction resulted in the Company being renamed to "Butterfly Network, Inc.," Legacy Butterfly being renamed “BFLY Operations, Inc.” and the Company’s Class A common stock and warrants to purchase Class A common stock commencing trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on February 16, 2021 under the symbol "BFLY" and “BFLY WS”, respectively. As a result of the Business Combination, we received gross proceeds of approximately $589 million and the business of Legacy Butterfly became our business.

​
The Evolution of Ultrasound
​
Digital health is systematically changing the way healthcare practitioners deliver care by providing information that informs better decision-making, while increasing access and significantly reducing patient-care costs. Butterfly iQ+ is designed for this new wave of medical care with an easy-to-use interface that displays ultrasound information on your smartphone or tablet in real-time. 
​
Historically, the global ultrasound market has been dominated by traditional cart-based devices. These devices are accessible only to highly specialized, highly trained technicians and are located predominantly in hospitals, imaging centers, and physicians’ offices. Many healthcare institutions throughout the world lack the facilities and capital necessary to acquire and maintain expensive cart-based devices and cannot afford the highly trained individuals required to operate them. 
​
Traditional cart-based equipment typically ranges from $45,000 to $60,000 per new device in the mid-range and is required to be operated by trained healthcare professionals. More recently, we have seen the introduction of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) and handheld devices with an average price point of $15,000, based on $5,000 to $7,000 per probe, some requiring two to three probes to cover a comparable range of cleared indications to the single probe Butterfly iQ+ and an upfront software investment for access to advanced imaging modes (e.g. pulsed-wave Doppler) and workflow (e.g. cloud storage) which can reach upwards of $2,000. However, these POCUS devices operate off the same platform as traditional cart-based ultrasound, limited by their application of the same 60-year-old piezoelectric crystal technology, leaving limited opportunity for future progress. 
​
Although still required to be operated by trained healthcare practitioners, we are developing a technology roadmap to make it easier for users of all skill levels to use the device. By taking the burden off the user, we believe that Butterfly iQ+ will change the paradigm of how clinical decisions are made with a handheld, whole body ultrasound that can provide critical information earlier in care. We believe that this information delivered through imaging with an intuitive user interface will further drive costs down and expand the use of imaging at clinical point-of-care.
​
Market Opportunity
​
Long term, we are on a journey to address a potential new market that we estimate exceeds $100 billion. We believe our solution addresses an unmet need across an addressable market of 42 million healthcare practitioners, including approximately 2 million veterinarians and vet technicians, 12 million medical doctors and 28 million nurses and midwives worldwide. 
​
In the near term, we are first driving adoption with healthcare practitioners, including doctors and nurses in healthcare systems and a focused group of initial customers in the veterinary market, comprised of companion animal, mixed animal, equine veterinarians and veterinary academic institutions.
​
We believe our solution can address this market, and moves beyond the restrictions of the existing ultrasound market, because our solution empowers practitioners with imaging information at point-of-care that is practical, mobile, interoperable, and easy-to-use. Our aspiration is to be as ubiquitous as the stethoscope and a tool used by physicians everywhere and anywhere care is delivered.

​
We believe our differentiated Butterfly iQ+ handheld device and our growing user base of healthcare systems, medical schools and individual practitioners, position us well to drive an evolution in healthcare. Similar to the human patient market, our solution for the veterinarian market is also driving an impact in veterinary care and education.
​
We believe the valuable information generated from a small handheld with low cost, quality imaging and an interface designed for ease-of-use are attractive to healthcare systems that seek to improve care at lower cost. These attributes also allow the use of our Butterfly iQ+ by practitioners beyond traditional health system environments to where health systems look to evolve, such as the home. This evolution would enable the application of ultrasound information in broad clinical utility and practice with patient-performed scanning to home monitoring, subject to our obtaining appropriate marketing authorizations for such intended uses. 
​
The advantages of our technology align with recent industry trends, including the shift to in-home medical care, affordability, harnessing of AI and deep learning, collaboration through the cloud, disruptive medical innovation, and increasing access to care. In addition, by expanding the settings in which medical imaging can be done, the Butterfly iQ+ device may provide opportunities for earlier detection and prevention of disease, while reducing cost. This aligns with the focus on consumer health empowerment, wellness, and acceleration of value-based care, all of which are important themes in the healthcare industry today and we believe have become increasingly more important during the COVID-19 pandemic.
​
Business Strategy
​
As the first semiconductor-based, handheld, whole body ultrasound devices, the Butterfly iQ and iQ+ cloud-based solution is a leading part of the medical imaging revolution. Leveraging this novel technology, our solution can scan, process and store high quality images at the bedside that can then be transferred between systems, as well as address hospital and health system workflows, an interoperability valued by customers in today’s market. 
​
We believe that with our current products and solutions, we have created a new standard for medical imaging, and we are focused on staying at the leading edge of technical innovation. We believe our solution is only the first step in our development and we plan to continually improve it and expand our product and service offerings. We recently launched Butterfly Blueprint and Compass software, an expanded solution, which we are implementing within healthcare systems to enable these customers to deploy our solution at scale.
​
We believe that through the penetration of the existing addressable market, and the potential subsequent expansion into new markets, as well as places that do not currently use medical imaging or where access to imaging is limited, we can bring the adoption of medical imaging to greater scale in countries where there is limited access to healthcare. 
​
In the near-term, we are focused on key markets and opportunities to innovate and grow as we develop a new market. We are driving adoption of Butterfly across four areas: 

1) | Hospitals and healthcare systems, initially focused in the United States;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Expanding into international markets and driving global health equity to improve care across all settings;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Moving Butterfly into home-based care, subject to appropriate authorizations; and
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | Capturing opportunities in adjacent markets to drive growth.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------

​
Across these four areas, we have three core principles that will help drive adoption that we call our “3 E’s” – our commitment to ensure that Butterfly is: Easy, Everywhere, and Economical.
​

● | Easy to use, enabling access to the most information with the least amount of effort through education, an intuitive interface and AI.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Everywhere, the scope of our journey to change the standard of care. We are focused on making Butterfly useful in more settings with cutting edge features and capabilities and building new business models to put Butterfly into every clinician’s pocket. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Economical, creating, capturing and delivering value and affordability for all. We are focused on completing health economics studies to demonstrate that our system delivers better, more informed, lower cost care.

Because the Butterfly iQ+ is mobile and easy-to-use, healthcare practitioners can have access to ultrasound information outside of traditional settings, increasing convenience for both practitioners and patients. This could improve health outcomes, while avoiding expensive treatments, generating economic value for both the patient and payor, which is aligned with the healthcare mega-trend of value-based care. As our device reaches new markets and new users and, with appropriate marketing authorizations, enables more direct interaction with patients, including remote patient monitoring, we believe this trend will accelerate, further improving outcomes and reducing costs. This reduction of costs has the potential to create economic value for the whole healthcare system across clinical applications and markets where ultrasound scanning is used.
​
Longer term, as patient-focused, value-based care delivery models continue to scale, we believe handheld ultrasound devices will find a potential market in at-home care settings with at-home medical personnel and patient-performed scanning, subject to appropriate authorizations.
​
Products
​
Our products include a combination of hardware and software, including Butterfly iQ and iQ+ probes, software subscriptions, and accessories. In addition, we also offer cloud-based software solutions to healthcare systems, teleguidance, in-app educational tutorials, formal education programs through our Butterfly Academy software, as well as clinical support and services for large scale deployments.
​
Butterfly iQ and iQ+
​
In 2018, Legacy Butterfly commercially launched Butterfly iQ, the world’s first handheld, single-probe, whole-body ultrasound system using semiconductor technology that is commercially available, and in 2020, Legacy Butterfly launched the Butterfly iQ+ with additional features and improved performance. 
​
Since then, we have sold and shipped more than 57,000 Butterfly iQ and Butterfly iQ+ devices (“iQ devices”). Butterfly iQ+’s list price is approximately $2,400 per device, making it a high-quality and affordable alternative to the costly traditional cart-based equipment and a number of other handheld devices currently on the market. Powered by our Ultrasound-on-Chip™, Butterfly’s high-performance imaging capabilities support fast and confident clinical decision-making. 
​
Our Butterfly iQ+ device connects directly to a compatible iPhone or Android smartphone or tablet to provide its imaging and software features for more than two consecutive hours according to average use as determined from field data analytics and charges to full battery in approximately five hours. In select countries, our proprietary software harnesses AI designed to drive ease-of-use for image acquisition and improved analysis, further used to guide and educate practitioners, as well as provide quality control. 
​
The Butterfly iQ+ has 22 pre-set settings generated in part with AI that optimize images obtained from scanning different areas of the body. 
​
Within the Butterfly application, users can utilize six imaging modes, including B-Mode, Color Doppler, M-Mode Power Doppler and Pulsed Wave Doppler, Biplane, as well as additional measuring tools used for a variety of specialties, nursing and obstetrician calculations. 
​
These features allow healthcare practitioners to perform surface area and volume measurements on the anatomical objects that are imaged and can use color Doppler to identify movement of fluid, similar to features provided by legacy products in the market. 
​

● | For the obstetric clinicians, the device tools can perform gestational age and amniotic fluid index calculations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | The device tools can provide automated bladder volume calculations, with 3D visualizations and enables easier line placements using NeedleVizTM technology and Biplane ImagingTM. These tools can be utilized across broad clinical applications and specialties.

​

● | Using TeleGuidanceTM, healthcare practitioners can perform ultrasound remotely, providing real-time guidance by connecting with a novice user or peer directly from the Butterfly iQ+ app. Through our Teleguidance feature, healthcare practitioners can control the settings of the application while the device is in use and help the user identify the image.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We believe these pre-set settings and intuitive operation features through smartphones will enable healthcare practitioners who are not medical imaging experts to adopt our device, expanding our user base beyond the traditional ultrasound user base. This traditional base of ultrasound users has been limited because existing ultrasound devices often require unique environments and extensive training to operate, while the Butterfly iQ+ device can be used by general and other healthcare practitioners across the healthcare industry.
​
Butterfly iQ+ is comprised of both durable hardware and dynamic software solutions designed to make ultrasound imaging accessible to all healthcare practitioners, including nurses. We also sell accessories for the Butterfly iQ and iQ+ including cases, adaptors and carts.

Software Subscriptions
​
We believe that the software and analytics capabilities of our solution coupled with the Butterfly iQ+ device empowers smarter and expanded scanning, quality assurance, credentialing, documentation and billing that can generate both incremental revenue for healthcare systems and independent practitioners, but also reduce costs for payers from earlier detection and prevention of adverse downstream events due to suboptimal care decisions or treatment complications. 
​
We currently offer different software membership plans, including Pro Individual, our complete ultrasound solution for individual users that is priced at $420 per year, and Pro Custom, an offering that allows individuals to choose their add-on features, to suit their needs. In addition, we offer other membership plans that are specific to customer needs, including iQ+ Care, for bladder scanner and vascular access application solutions, integrated software enterprise solutions to enable ultrasound deployments at scale and medical education subscriptions for universities. 
​
Through our software subscription options, users can upload scanned images to our HIPAA-compliant cloud, which has unlimited storage and links to electronic medical records (“EMRs”), hospital and office systems, allowing for seamless transfer of images that can also be accessed from a desktop computer. 
​
Through our ongoing collaborations with the healthcare community, we are continuing to optimize our software ecosystem, including by harnessing AI to develop additional clinical and product advancements for our users. We believe that these efforts could drive ease-of-use for image acquisition, improve analysis, and expand its most utilized features with extensive quality control. Our AI has and is expected to continue to allow us to develop programs that guide and educate healthcare practitioners on how to utilize the Butterfly iQ+ device, with the goal of improving their clinical impact and productivity globally.
​
Educational Tools
​
Our platform features education tools to enable users to quickly gain proficiency in conducting exams, including hundreds of educational videos taught by experts. In 2021 we launched Butterfly AcademyTM that provides embedded education and training to enable clinicians across care settings, to support long-term scaling of Butterfly throughout a healthcare system and for use in medical education applications. In addition, our software application also features TeleGuidance, which is the first integrated ultrasound telemedicine platform. This tool allows a remote, trained healthcare practitioner to view and guide the ultrasound imaging through the smartphone application and live video.
​
Butterfly iQ+ Vet
​
In 2021, we launched Butterfly iQ+ Vet, a handheld ultrasound system designed to bring value to veterinarians in a variety of care settings, helping to usher in a new standard for veterinary medicine.
​

As of December 31, 2021, iQ+ Vet is available in 21 international markets, bringing first of its kind innovation to veterinarians. The product includes a specially designed animal-specific probe for ease of use and maneuvering, Color-Doppler and NeedleViz. We are changing the way that veterinarians deliver care, providing more information through imaging at the point-of-care, particularly since their patients do not speak.
​
Marketing and Sales
​
We market our products through our targeted U.S. sales organization, which is engaged in sales efforts and promotional activities primarily to health institutions as well as to healthcare institutions through direct sales and distributor partnerships outside of the United States. In the United States, Butterfly has been purchased by a clinician in all of the largest 100 healthcare systems. We use a variety of marketing tools to drive adoption, foster continued usage and establish brand loyalty for our devices and software. We recognize the importance of the role of education in accelerating adoption of our products by those medical professionals without existing ultrasound skills.
​
We sell through three main channels:

● | A targeted, regional, direct salesforce focused on large healthcare system-wide implementations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An eCommerce website through which we sell our Butterfly iQ+ and iQ+ Vet to healthcare practitioners in these geographies, where allowed by local law.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Distributor, veterinary and affiliate relationships to unlock additional channels to supplement our direct and eCommerce sales.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In 2021, we have invested heavily in building out and educating our salesforce and sales support teams, and plan to continue to do so, with the ultimate goal of growing adoption at large scale healthcare systems. As we continue to grow, we plan to expand on our client experience resources to work with our customers to deploy Butterfly iQ+ and Butterfly Blueprint. We believe that we can build a community of healthcare system customers around our solution to share insights, techniques, and new regulatory-compliant ways of applying our solution, all of which we believe should continue to drive clinical behavior change, adoption and retention, as well as clinical and economic studies. 
​
As we expanded our healthcare system software offerings and developed relationships with larger health systems in 2021, we have increased the proportion of our sales to health systems compared to eCommerce. Because institutions often make decisions to purchase on a system-wide level, we believe enterprise sales can generate economies of scale with larger volumes and larger numbers of users, while also increasing user retention. The health system channel also yields more comprehensive software subscriptions, which further increases our revenue from devices and subscriptions sold. We are working towards increasingly integrated solutions to maximize our value to large healthcare customers, as well as continuing to improve our sales and support infrastructure. Our ability to connect and integrate with traditional third-party ultrasound systems gives enterprise customers a solution to the governance and workflow challenges that may have previously limited the utilization and billing of point of care imaging devices. Health system customers deploying our solution can benefit from a streamlined clinical workflow that reduces the exam documentation burden typically associated with traditional ultrasound systems. By adopting Butterfly Blueprint and Compass software, customers can responsibly manage and optimize value from their fleets of point of care imaging devices.
​
We continue to develop our sales and marketing organization, which consists of a dedicated sales team, sales operations and sales support personnel that are complemented by a marketing team. As of December 31, 2021, we had 124 people employed globally in sales, sales support, and marketing.
​

In terms of geographic markets, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, a substantial majority of our revenues were derived from sales to customers based in the United States. We aim to further expand our international customer base in the future. We believe our differentiated Butterfly iQ+ handheld device and our growing user base of Butterfly iQ+ practitioners, with sales to or agreements with most of the largest 100 U.S. healthcare systems and across approximately 30 countries, position us well to compete in the existing ultrasound market and to potentially expand into emerging markets.

Technology
​
Butterfly is a pioneer in putting ultrasound on a semiconductor chip. This novel and proprietary Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology enables whole-body complete ultrasound imaging with a single probe. We are continuing to improve our software by harnessing AI with a goal to drive ease-of-use for image acquisition, improve analysis, guide and educate practitioners, and provide quality control. As a result of utilizing these technologies, our first and second generation, Butterfly iQ and iQ+ products have a small, hand-held size, low cost, and simple user interface, making ultrasound technology more accessible outside of large healthcare institutions. This contrasts sharply to existing systems that are built using often expensive piezoelectric crystal technology, which can lead to high upfront costs and thereby constrain access and usage. 
​
Additionally, the technology driving the Butterfly iQ and Butterfly iQ+ devices may be able to continually scale and improve. In 2021, we have continued to improve our chip technology, AI capabilities and image quality. We expect to continue development of the device with product offerings that may include enhanced performance, additional procedural applications, changes to the device that enable and encourage usage and alternative form factors.
​
With cloud-based technology, we have also continued to create content and applications to enrich the overall software ecosystems and deliver additional clinical and product advancements for our users.

Through this product development, we believe we will be positioned to remain on the forefront of medical imaging with a continued focus on enabling access to more information at low cost and reduced effort and with education, an intuitive interface and AI to unlock the power of point-of-care information quickly and confidently, allowing us to enable healthcare practitioners to transform care with Butterfly.
​
Reimbursement
​
The Butterfly iQ+ leverages pre-existing, routine CPT codes that enable healthcare providers and practitioners to obtain per-scan reimbursement in the specialties of anesthesiology, cardiology, critical care, emergency medicine, endocrinology and ultrasound-guided procedures. We intend to pursue incremental, new or expansionary CPT codes for reimbursement in future scan categories and categories concurrent to support the successful go-to-market strategy of the product pipeline.
​
Competition

Several large companies, such as GE, Philips and Sonosite currently constitute the bulk of ultrasound sales. High regulatory, distribution, manufacturing and service-related long-term contractual costs represent significant barriers to entry for any new player. We expect that the existing market participants will remain strong active players in the future.
​
As a general matter, we view competition on two levels:

● | Conventional ultrasound systems; and
--+-------------------------------------


● | The development of other hand-held ultrasound systems with the same or better attributes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The primary competition comes from established market participants offering conventional ultrasound systems. While Butterfly's target is often non-traditional ultrasound users we do compete with both traditional ultrasound manufacturers as well as other handheld ultrasound systems.

​
Manufacturing

Our Butterfly iQ products are built using both custom-made and off-the-shelf components supplied by outside manufacturers and vendors located in China, Taiwan and Thailand. The key custom-made component in the Butterfly iQ probe is the ultrasound transducer module consisting of a custom chip and lens.

We purchase some of our components and materials used in manufacturing, including the transducer module, from single sources. Although we believe that alternatives would be available, it would take time to identify and validate replacement components, which could negatively affect our ability to supply our products on a timely basis. We cannot give assurances that any alternative supplier would be able to recreate the manufacturing processes currently in use. To mitigate this risk, we typically carry a significant inventory of critical components.

All of our Butterfly iQ probes are manufactured, tested, shipped and supported by Benchmark Electronics, Inc., or Benchmark, from its facility in Thailand. We believe that this manufacturing strategy and supply chain is efficient and conserves capital. However, in the event it becomes necessary to utilize a different contract manufacturer for our Butterfly iQ products, we would experience additional costs, delays and difficulties in doing so, and our business could be harmed.
​

In connection with the FSA, we and TSMC developed a proprietary manufacturing process and continue to collaborate on manufacturing process improvements.

Manufacture and Supply Agreement with Benchmark Electronics, Inc.

In October 2015, we entered into a Manufacture and Supply Agreement with Benchmark, which was amended effective in August 2019 and February 2021, or the MSA. Under the MSA, as amended, Benchmark agreed to manufacture our products pursuant to binding purchase orders, as well as non-binding forecasts. The parties have agreed to meet periodically regarding any minimum order quantities under the MSA.

Under the terms of the MSA, we granted Benchmark a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, fully-paid, royalty-free license, without the right to sublicense, to use our technology solely to manufacture our products. The MSA provides that we will own any right, title and interest in any improvements or modifications to our technology made in the course of performance of Benchmark’s obligations under the MSA. We and Benchmark also agreed to indemnify each other against certain third-party claims.

Pursuant to the February 2021 amendment, we agreed to provide global production exclusivity to Benchmark for our current products and other hand-held probes which may be manufactured for us, for a specified exclusivity period, in exchange for delayed payment of certain invoices that we paid in March 2021. The exclusivity period is terminable and we have the right to purchase products from another supplier in the event Benchmark fails to deliver more than 10% of the products based on the revenue of orders during the calendar quarter.

The MSA has an initial three-year term and will renew automatically for additional two-year terms unless either party gives 180 days’ prior written notice before the end of the then-current term to the other party electing not to renew the agreement. The MSA or any purchase order under the MSA may be terminated by either party for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice to the other party. The MSA may also be terminated by either party by written notice upon the occurrence of (i) a breach by the other party under the agreement which is not cured within 30 days after written notice by the terminating party, (ii) the other party becomes insolvent, dissolves, liquidates or ceases to conduct business or (iii) the occurrence of payment-related breaches. Benchmark may also terminate the agreement upon the filing of any petition against us under bankruptcy or similar laws, where such petition is not vacated within 10 days via court order.

Distribution Agreement with Cardinal Health 105, Inc.

In July 2018, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with Cardinal Health 105, Inc., or Cardinal Health. Under the Distribution Agreement, we are responsible for delivery of our products to Cardinal Health’s facilities, and Cardinal Health acts as the distribution agent and authorized distributor of record of our products to our customers, including, but not limited to, wholesalers, specialty distributors, physicians, clinics, hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers in the United States. Under the Distribution Agreement, we provide Cardinal Health with forecasts of the volume of our products to be handled and distributed by Cardinal Health. We make payments to Cardinal Health for its distribution services pursuant to a fee schedule.

17



The initial term of the Distribution Agreement expired in August 2020. The Distribution Agreement is subject to automatic renewal for additional successive two-year terms unless we terminate the agreement upon 90 prior written days’ notice or Cardinal Health terminates the agreement upon written notice of non-renewal to us at least 180 days prior to the end of a term. Either party may terminate the Distribution Agreement upon (i) the other party’s entry into bankruptcy proceedings, receipt of a bankruptcy order that is not discharged within 30 days, or similar events, or (ii) a material breach by the other party that is not cured within 30 days after the non-breaching party gives written notice. Additionally, if we breach our payment obligations under the Distribution Agreement and such breach is not cured within 15 days after Cardinal Health provides written notice of non-payment, Cardinal Health may terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ prior written notice.

Intellectual Property

Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights protection and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies.

The patents owned and in-licensed by us are generally directed to the architecture of our ultrasonic imaging devices, our microfabricated ultrasonic transducers and machine learning for ultrasound applications. We have developed a portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications directed to commercial products and technologies for potential development. We believe that our intellectual property is a core strength of our business, and our strategy includes the continued development of our patent portfolio.

Butterfly iQ, iQ+ and Related Technology

As of December 31, 2021, we owned approximately 352 issued patents and approximately 455 pending patent applications. Of our approximately 352 issued patents, approximately 104 were issued U.S. utility patents and approximately 35 were issued U.S. design patents. Of our approximately 455 pending patent applications, approximately 149 were pending U.S. utility patent applications and approximately 13 were pending U.S. design applications. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, we owned approximately 213 issued patents in foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, and India, and approximately 293 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea and India, corresponding to the foregoing. In total, as of December 31, 2021, we owned approximately 187 patent families generally directed to our ultrasound products, including manufacturing, circuit components, and add-on features. These issued patents and pending patent applications (if they were to be issued as patents) have expected expiration dates ranging between 2030 and 2042.
​
In addition to patents, we also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by generally requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, suppliers, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also forbid them from using or incorporating the proprietary rights of third parties during their engagement with us. We also generally require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.

License Agreements

We have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses in the ordinary course of business relating to our technologies or other intellectual property rights or assets.

Exclusive (Equity) Agreement with Leland Stanford Junior University

In June 2013, we entered into an Exclusive (Equity) Agreement, or the Stanford Agreement, with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford. Pursuant to the Stanford Agreement, Stanford granted us a co-exclusive, worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell and sell products covered by patent rights to Stanford’s wafer bonding technology. The rights licensed to us are for ultrasound applications using the wafer bonding technology excluding certain applications, and the license remains exclusive, except for certain non-exclusive applications, 

18



until the earlier of December 23, 2023 or the seventh anniversary of the first sale of any product using the licensed technology, and thereafter will be nonexclusive until the last licensed patent expires. The last licensed patent is currently expected to expire in 2030. The rights licensed to us, except for the non-exclusive applications, are sublicensable during such exclusive term, subject to our continued development or sale of the products using the technology licensed under the agreement and, following the exclusive term, subject to Stanford’s prior approval. The Stanford Agreement outlines certain milestones to be met by us in connection with the development and sales of these products.

Under the terms of the Stanford Agreement, we paid a one-time, non-refundable upfront royalty fee. We are required to pay Stanford low single-digit royalties on all net sales of products that use the licensed technology, as well as a portion of any sublicensing revenues, during the term of the Stanford Agreement and if certain products using the licensed technology are made, used, imported, or offered for sale before the date the Stanford Agreement terminates, and those products are sold after the termination date, we will pay Stanford an earned royalty for our exercise of rights based on the net sales of those products. We are also obligated to pay Stanford annual license maintenance fees, which are fully creditable against any royalty payments made by us for such year. We are also required to provide Stanford with periodic reports documenting our progress toward the development and commercialization of products using the licensed technology. Stanford is responsible under the agreement for preparing, filing and prosecuting patent claims and for maintaining the patents pertaining to the licensed technology.

Stanford may terminate the agreement in the event that we are materially delinquent on any payment, fail to diligently develop and commercialize a product incorporating the licensed technology, materially miss a milestone under the agreement, are in material breach of any substantive provision under the agreement, or knowingly provide any false report or are materially delinquent on any report, in each case which is not remedied within cure period. In addition, if we are not diligently developing and commercializing such a product incorporating the licensed technology, materially miss a milestone or knowingly provide a false report or are delinquent on any report, and we do not cure, the agreement shall not terminate, but it remains subject to termination by Stanford and the license shall convert to a non-exclusive license. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon at least 30 days’ prior written notice. Upon termination of the agreement, all rights to the licensed technology revert to Stanford. Our obligation to pay royalties accrued or accruable survives any termination or expiration of the agreement.

Government Regulation

The diagnostic medical devices that we manufacture and distribute are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation program be conducted before a device can be approved for marketing and commercial distribution. In addition, healthcare regulatory bodies in the United States and around the world impose a range of requirements related to paying for medical devices and the procedures in which they are used, including laws intended to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of healthcare dollars.
​
U.S. Laws and Regulations

At the federal level, our diagnostic ultrasound products and certain accessories are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, referred to as the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, the FDA regulates product design and development, nonclinical and clinical testing, pre-market clearance, authorization or approval, establishment registration and product listing, product manufacturing, product packaging and labeling, product storage, advertising and promotion, product distribution, recalls and field actions, servicing and post-market clinical surveillance. Some of our products are also subject to the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act, administered by the FDA, which imposes performance standards and record keeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements for electronic products that emit radiation, such as x-rays, although diagnostic ultrasound products like ours are subject only to a limited portion of those requirements. A number of U.S. states also impose licensing and compliance regimes on companies that manufacture or distribute prescription devices into or within the state.

19



In addition, the commercialization and use of our devices in the United States is subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and state agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of payment for health care items and services. Federal laws and regulations apply primarily in connection with government payer programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, but state laws apply more broadly, encompassing health care items and services covered by private payers. At the state and federal level, the government’s interest is in regulating the quality and cost of health care and protecting the independent clinical judgment of licensed healthcare providers.

The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that any claims made in commerce are consistent with the products’ regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims being made, that the advertising is neither false nor misleading, and that patient or physician testimonials or endorsements we or our agents disseminate comply with disclosure and other regulatory requirements. In general, medical device manufacturers and distributors may not promote or advertise their products for uses not within the scope of a given product’s intended use(s), make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims, or use third parties to make claims about the product that the manufacturer/distributor could not lawfully make itself.
​
FDA Regulation of Medical Devices

The FDA classifies medical devices into three classes based on risk. Regulatory control increases from Class I (lowest risk) to Class III (highest risk). The FDA generally must clear or approve the commercial sale of most new medical devices that fall within product categories designated as Class II and III. Commercial sales of Class II (except for Class II devices exempt from pre-market notification requirements) and Class III medical devices within the United States must be preceded either by a pre-market notification and clearance pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDCA (Class II) or by the granting of a pre-market approval, or PMA, (Class III), after a pre-market application is submitted. Both 510(k) notifications and PMA applications must be submitted to FDA with user fees (approximately $13,000 for a 510(k) and approximately $375,000 for a PMA in FY 2022), although reduced fees for small businesses are available. Class I devices are generally exempt from pre-market review and notification, as are some moderate-risk Class II devices. All classes of devices must comply with FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, establishment registration, medical device listing, labeling requirements, and medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, which are collectively referred to as device general controls. Class II devices may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines or particularized labeling. Some Class I and Class II devices may be exempted by regulation from the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR.

A 510(k) pre-market notification must contain information sufficient to demonstrate that the new device is substantially equivalent to a device commercially distributed prior to May 28, 1976 or to a device that has been determined by the FDA to be substantially equivalent to such a so-called “pre-amendments” device. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a non-exempt Class II device, we must submit a pre-market notification to the FDA demonstrating that our product is substantially equivalent to such a predicate device. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process generally takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted, but it may take longer if the FDA has significant questions or needs more information about the new device or its manufacturing or quality controls.

As part of the 510(k) notification process for Class II devices like our iQ system, which has an existing classification regulation available for purposes of the regulatory filing, the FDA may require the following:
​

● | Comprehensive product description and indications for use.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | Extensive nonclinical tests and/or animal studies, performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations, as well as any performance standards or other testing requirements established by FDA through regulations or device-specific guidance.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Comprehensive review of one or more predicate devices and development of data supporting the new product’s substantial equivalence to such predicate devices.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Assuming successful completion of all required testing, a detailed 510(k) notification is submitted to the FDA requesting clearance to market the product. This pre-market notification includes all relevant data from pertinent pre-clinical and clinical trials (if applicable), together with detailed information relating to the product’s manufacturing controls and proposed labeling, and other relevant documentation. The FDA evaluates all 510(k) submissions prior to filing for full 

20



review based on specific acceptance criteria and may issue a refuse-to-accept notification if the submission is deficient with respect to any of the established criteria. If the FDA determines that the applicant’s device is substantially equivalent to the identified predicate device(s), the agency will issue a 510(k) clearance letter that authorizes commercial marketing of the device for one or more specific indications for use. If the FDA determines that the applicant’s device is not substantially equivalent to the predicate device(s), the agency will issue a not-substantially-equivalent letter stating that the new device may not be commercially distributed.

After a new medical device receives FDA 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require the submission of a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make the determination of whether a device modification requires a new 510(k) notification or PMA in the first instance, but the FDA may review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA for a particular change, the FDA may retroactively require the manufacturer to submit a 510(k) pre-market notification or a PMA. The FDA may also require the manufacturer to cease U.S. marketing and/or recall any distributed units of the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for the modification is obtained.

If a previously unclassified new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. However, if such a device would be considered low or moderate risk (in other words, it does not rise to the level of requiring the approval of a PMA), it may be eligible for the De Novo classification process. The De Novo classification process allows a device developer to request that the novel medical device be able to obtain marketing authorization as either a Class I or Class II device, rather than having it regulated as a high-risk Class III device subject to the PMA requirements. As with the 510(k) pre-market notification process described above, any modification to a device authorized through the De Novo process that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of such device, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require the submission of a PMA. De Novo classification requests are also subject to user fees, unless a specific exemption applies (over $112,000 in FY 2022).
​
In October 2021, the FDA issued a final rule that would formally codify requirements for the medical device De Novo process and the procedures and criteria for product developers to file a De Novo classification request (86 Fed. Reg. 54,826). Over the twenty years preceding the final rule, the De Novo process has been implemented by the FDA pursuant to statutory authorities and somewhat organically through informal guidance and iterative changes by Congress. Although the final rule does not affect marketed products such as our marketed products, the FDA’s goals in promulgating the final rule are to create a predictable, consistent and transparent De Novo classification process for innovative medical device developers.

As an alternative to the De Novo classification process, a company that develops or manufactures a novel device could also file a reclassification petition seeking to change the automatic Class III designation of the novel post-amendment device under Section 513(f)(3) of the FDCA. The FDA can also initiate reclassification of an existing device type on its own initiative. In December 2018, the FDA issued a final rule to clarify the administrative process through which the FDA reclassifies a medical device. To reclassify a device under section 513(e) of the FDCA, the FDA must first publish a proposed reclassification order that includes a summary of the valid scientific evidence that supports the reclassification; convene a device classification panel meeting; and consider comments to the public docket before it then publishes a final reclassification order in the Federal Register.

Our iQ and iQ+ probes have been classified and are regulated as Class II devices, although future products we develop may be classified as Class III devices and may require a PMA. A PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, pre-clinical, clinical, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use(s). A PMA application also must include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling. After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, it is considered “filed” and the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. During this substantive review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may 

21



be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to evaluate compliance with the QSR, which requires manufacturers to implement and follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.

FDA review of a PMA application is required to be completed within 180 days of the application’s filing date although in some cases approval may take significantly longer. The current user fee agreement between the FDA and the medical device industry sets as a target that PMA reviews be completed in under one year. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
​

● | the product may not be safe or effective for its intended use(s) to the FDA’s satisfaction;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the data from the applicant’s nonclinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the manufacturing process or facilities that the applicant uses may not meet applicable requirements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in the FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of the device.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If an FDA evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facility is favorable, the FDA will generally issue an “approval letter,” which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been met to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of a device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facility is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a “not approvable letter.” The FDA may also determine that additional trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while such additional trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy. PMA approval may also be granted with post-approval requirements such as the need for additional patient follow-up for an indefinite period of time.

New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for any modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplements are limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.

Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) pre-market notification. In order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, a company must, among other things, apply for and obtain institutional review board, or IRB, approval of the proposed investigation. In addition, if the clinical study involves a “significant risk” (as defined by the FDA) to human health, the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain FDA approval of an investigational device exemption, or IDE, application. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of study participants, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by a duly-appointed IRB for each clinical trial site. The FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward, but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations, which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which include, among other things, recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA’s regulations for IRB approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product.

22



The commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or may be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application (or clearance of a 510(k) notification or grant of a De Novo classification request, as applicable), for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
​

• | the FDA, the IRB(s), or other regulatory authorities may not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or may place a clinical trial on hold;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | participants may not enroll in clinical trials at the rate we anticipate;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | participants may not comply with trial protocols;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | participant follow-up may not occur at the rate we anticipate;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients may experience adverse side effects;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | participants may die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the use of our products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IRBs and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject our trial protocol;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | third-party clinical investigators may decline to participate in a trial or may not perform a trial on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, GCPs or other FDA requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we or third-party organizations may not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | third-party clinical investigators may have significant financial interests related to us or the study that the FDA deems sufficient to make the study results unreliable, or we or investigators fail to disclose such interests;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any unfavorable regulatory inspections of our clinical trial sites or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the interim or final results of the clinical trial may be inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or effectiveness; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA may conclude that the results from our trial and/or trial design are inadequate to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the product.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In 2017, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our iQ probe, and the FDA determined, following a 2020 pre-submission meeting with us, that the Butterfly iQ+ was eligible to be marketed under the original 510(k).

In addition, our proprietary software and data transfer service allows researchers to control the transfer of data from certain devices to research tools and databases according to their own research workflows. The infrastructure of the data management service is considered a “medical device data system”, or MDDS, and does not require 510(k) clearance. An MDDS is a hardware or software product that transfers, stores, converts, formats, and displays medical device data. An MDDS does not modify the data or modify the display of the data, and it does not by itself control the functions or parameters of any other medical device. An MDDS is not intended to be used for active patient monitoring. Software that meets the definition of an MDDS (such as that comprising our service offering) is excluded from the definition of “device” under the FDCA, and from the regulations applicable to devices, while hardware that meets the definition of an MDDS is generally classified as a low-risk, Class I device product that is exempt from pre-market review and notification.

After a device is authorized for marketing and placed in commercial distribution (or, for 510(k)-exempt products, placed into commerce without first obtaining FDA clearance or approval), numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply to the device. All device classes must meet general regulatory controls, including:
​

• | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, storage, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations, which govern the mandatory elements of the device labels and packaging (including Unique Device Identifier markings for certain categories of products);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the MDR regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | voluntary and mandatory device recalls to address problems when a device is defective and/or could be a risk to health; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23




• | correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The FDA’s MDR requirements also extend to healthcare facilities that use medical devices in providing care to patients, or “device user facilities,” which include hospitals, ambulatory surgical facilities, nursing homes, outpatient diagnostic facilities, or outpatient treatment facilities, but not physician offices. A device user facility must report any device-related death to both the FDA and the device manufacturer, or any device-related serious injury to the manufacturer (or, if the manufacturer is unknown, to the FDA) within 10 days of the event. Device user facilities are not required to report device malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur but may voluntarily report such malfunctions through MedWatch, the FDA’s Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program.
​
In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct post-market surveillance studies or order us to establish and maintain a system for tracking our products through the chain of distribution to the patient level. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of our clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
​

• | Warning Letters or Untitled Letters that require corrective action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines and civil penalties;
--+---------------------------


• | unanticipated expenditures;
--+----------------------------


• | delays in approving/clearing or refusal to approve/clear our future products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export our products for sale in other countries;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | suspension or withdrawal of FDA approval or clearance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | product recall or seizure;
--+---------------------------


• | interruption of production;
--+----------------------------


• | operating restrictions;
--+------------------------


• | injunctions; and
--+-----------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------


We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers, and some suppliers of components or device accessories are also required to manufacture medical device products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements set forth in the QSR, unless explicitly exempted by regulation. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic pre-scheduled or unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue reports known as Forms FDA 483 or Notices of Inspectional Observations, which list instances where the FDA inspector believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If the observations are sufficiently serious or the manufacturer fails to respond appropriately, the FDA may issue Warning Letters, which are notices of intended enforcement actions against the manufacturer. For less serious violations that may not rise to the level of regulatory significance, the FDA may issue Untitled Letters. The FDA may take more significant administrative or legal action if a manufacturer continues to be in substantial noncompliance with applicable regulations.
​
For example, if the FDA believes we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements and patients are being subjected to serious risks, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recalls of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, initiate legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations, or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be unable to comply with all applicable FDA regulations.

U.S. Fraud and Abuse Laws and Other Compliance Requirements

Successfully commercializing a medical device or technology depends not only on FDA approval, but also on broad health insurance or third-party payor coverage. Government and private payors institute coverage criteria to ensure the appropriate utilization of products and services and to control costs. Limited third party payor coverage for a technology or procedure may limit adoption and commercial viability, while broader coverage supports optimal market uptake. Favorable coverage decisions by government payors like Medicare or Medicaid are critical because private payors typically follow the government’s lead regarding reimbursement. However, manufacturers whose technology is reimbursed by government payors are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. These laws can be implicated by inappropriate sales and marketing arrangements with healthcare providers. Many commonly accepted commercial practices are illegal in the healthcare industry and violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
Anti-kickback Laws.   The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Department of Health and Human Services — Office of the Inspector General, has issued regulations, commonly known as safe harbors, which set forth certain provisions that, if satisfied in their entirety, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor element may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities or invite litigation by private citizens under federal whistleblower laws. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broadly interpreted and aggressively enforced, with the result that beneficial commercial arrangements can be criminalized in the healthcare industry because of the Anti-Kickback Statute.

The penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by the government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.

Federal False Claims Act.   The federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim, or the knowing use of false statements or records to obtain payment from the federal government. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $11,181 and $22,363 for each separate false claim. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals (known as “relators” or, more commonly, “whistleblowers”) may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition, certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, even before the validity of the claim is established and even if the government decides not to intervene in the lawsuit. Healthcare companies may decide to agree to large settlements with the government and/or whistleblowers to avoid the cost and negative publicity associated with litigation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act amended federal law to provide that a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Criminal prosecution is possible for knowingly making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
Federal Physician Self-Referral Law.   The Federal Physician Self-Referral Law, also referred to as the Stark Law, prohibits a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician) who has a financial relationship with an entity from referring patients to that entity for certain designated health services, including durable medical equipment and supplies, payable by Medicare, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits such an entity from presenting or causing to be presented a claim to the Medicare program for such designated health services provided pursuant to a prohibited 

25



referral, and provides that certain collections related to any such claims must be refunded in a timely manner. Exceptions to the Stark Law include, among other things, exceptions for certain financial relationships, including both ownership and compensation arrangements. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute: to the extent that the statute is implicated and an exception does not apply, the statute is violated. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have implemented similar physician self-referral prohibitions that may extend to Medicaid, third party payors, and self-pay patients. Violations of the Stark Law must be reported and unauthorized claims must be refunded to Medicare in order to avoid potential liability under the federal False Claims Act for avoiding a known obligation to return identified overpayments. Violations of the Stark Law, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law and/or the federal False Claims Act can also form the basis for exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs.

Civil Monetary Penalties Law.   The Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or CMPL, authorizes the imposition of substantial civil money penalties against an entity that engages in certain prohibited activities including but not limited to violations of the Stark Law or Anti-Kickback Statute, knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim, employment of an excluded individual, and the provision or offer of anything of value to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the transferring party knows or should know is likely to influence beneficiary selection of a particular provider for which payment may be made in whole or part by a federal health care program, commonly known as the Beneficiary Inducement CMP. Remuneration is defined under the CMPL as any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value. There are certain exceptions to the definition of remuneration for offerings that meet the Financial Need, Preventative Care, or Promoting Access to Care exceptions (as defined in the CMPL). Sanctions for violations of the CMPL include civil monetary penalties and administrative penalties up to and including exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.
State Analogs of Federal Fraud and Abuse Laws.   Many U.S. states have their own laws intended to protect against fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and more broadly. In some cases these laws prohibit or regulate additional conduct beyond what federal law affects. Penalties for violating these laws can range from fines to criminal sanctions.

HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws and Regulations.   The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and implementing regulations, or HIPAA, created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

HIPAA, as well as a number of other federal and state privacy-related laws, extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information”, or PHI, under HIPAA. HIPAA applies to health plans, healthcare providers who engage in certain standard healthcare transactions electronically, such as electronic billing, and healthcare clearinghouses, all of which are referred to as “covered entities” under HIPAA. HIPAA requires covered entities to comply with privacy regulations limiting the use and disclosure of PHI, or the Privacy Rule, and security regulations that require the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information, or the Security Rule. HIPAA also requires covered entities to provide notification to affected individuals and to the federal government in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI, or the Breach Notification Rule. Certain provisions of the Privacy Rule and all provisions of the Security Rule apply to “business associates,” or organizations that provide services to covered entities involving the use or disclosure of PHI. Business associates, like us, are subject to direct liability for violation of these provisions. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to criminal and civil penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. The HIPAA privacy and security rule impose and will continue to impose significant costs on us in order to comply with these standards.

In addition, certain states have proposed or enacted legislation that will create new data privacy and security obligations for certain entities, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act that went into effect January 1, 2020.

FCPA and Other Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws.   The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign 

26



government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals or organizations in many countries. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations.

Physician Payment Sunshine Act.    Pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that was signed into law in March 2010, the federal government enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. As a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-regulated devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to this law, which requires us to track and annually report certain payments and other transfers of value that we make to U.S.-licensed physicians (defined broadly to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners) or U.S. teaching hospitals. We are also required to report certain ownership interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has the potential to impose penalties of up to $1.15 million per year for violations of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, depending on the circumstances, and payments reported also have the potential to draw scrutiny on payments to and relationships with physicians, which may have implications under the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law and other healthcare laws.

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and other transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities. Similar to the federal law, certain states also have adopted marketing and/or transparency laws relevant to device manufacturers, some of which are broader in scope. Certain states also mandate that device manufacturers implement compliance programs. Other states impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The need to build and maintain a robust compliance program with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in fines and penalties.

International Laws and Regulations

International marketing and distribution of medical devices are subject to regulation by foreign governments, and such regulations may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain marketing authorization in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, or EU, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries.

The primary regulatory environment in Europe is that of the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. In the EEA, medical devices currently are required to comply with the Essential Requirements defined in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, or MDD, (applicable in the non-EU EEA Member States via the Agreement on the EEA), a coordinated system for the authorization of medical devices. The directives and standards outlined in the MDD regulate the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive are entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the EEA. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a “notified body.” A notified body is an organization designated by an EU country to assess the conformity of certain products before being placed on the market. These bodies carry out tasks related to conformity assessment procedures set out in the applicable legislation, when a third party is required. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. An assessment by a notified body of one country within the EU is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the EU.

In 2017, EU regulatory bodies finalized a new Medical Device Regulation, which replaced the existing MDD framework and provided three years for transition and compliance, for a final effective date of May 26, 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the European Parliament voted in April 2020 to postpone implementation of the Medical Device Regulation by one year, giving the medical device industry and notified bodies until May 26, 2021 to come into compliance. The Medical Device Regulation changes several aspects of the existing regulatory framework for medical 

27



device marketing in Europe and is expected to result in increased regulatory oversight of all medical devices marketed in the EU, which may, in turn, increase the costs, time and requirements that need to be met in order to place an innovative or high-risk medical device on the European market. European medical device manufacturers and distributors are currently benefiting from a grace period for legacy MDD certificates that lasts until May 26, 2024. For a product to qualify for the grace period, there must be no significant changes to such a legacy medical device as described in its existing MDD certificate; the recertification process under the Medical Device Regulation requires a demonstration that the performance and the safety of the currently marketed medical device has been maintained and that the system meets the new regulatory requirements.

Outside of the EU, regulatory authorization needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our products. Some countries have adopted medical device regulatory regimes, such as the Classification Rules for Medical Devices published by the Hong Kong Department of Health, the Health Sciences Authority of Singapore regulation of medical devices under the Health Products Act, and Health Canada’s risk classification system for invasive devices, among others. Each country may have its own processes and requirements for medical device licensing, approval/clearance, and regulation, therefore requiring us to seek marketing authorizations on a country-by-country basis.
​
Moreover, as discussed further below, the United Kingdom left the EU on January 31, 2020, with a transitional period that expired on December 31, 2020. The United Kingdom and the EU entered into a trade agreement known as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), which came into effect on January 1, 2021. The TCA does not specifically refer to medical devices. However, as a result of Brexit, the Medical Device Regulation will not be implemented in the UK, and previous legislation that mirrored the Medical Device Regulation in the UK law has been revoked. The regulatory regime for medical devices in the UK will continue to be based on the requirements derived from EU legislation as of January 21, 2020, and the UK may choose to retain regulatory flexibility or align with the Medical Device Regulation going forward. CE markings will continue to be recognized in the UK, and certificates issued by EU recognized Notified Bodies will be valid in the UK, until June 30, 2023. For medical devices placed on the UK market after this period, the UK Conformity Assessment, or UKCA, marking will be mandatory. In contrast, UKCA marking and certificates issued by UK Notified Bodies will not be recognized on the EU market. The TCA does provide for cooperation and exchange of information in the area of product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls (or other similar actions). Depending on which countries products will ultimately be sold in, manufacturers may start seeking alternative sources for components if this would allow them to benefit from no tariffs. The rules for placing medical devices on the Northern Ireland market will differ from those in the UK.

Outside the United States, a range of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, as well as some industry-specific laws and codes of conduct, apply to the medical device industry and interactions with government officials and entities and healthcare professionals. Such laws include, but are not limited to the UK Bribery Act of 2010. Further, the EU member countries have emphasized a greater focus on healthcare fraud and abuse and have indicated greater attention to the industry by the European Anti-Fraud Office. Countries in Asia have also become more active in their enforcement of anti-bribery laws and with respect to procurement and supply chain fraud.

In the EU, increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that have and will continue to have substantial impact on the use of patient data across the healthcare industry became stronger in May 2018. We are subject to, and work to maintain compliance with, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR applies across the EU and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR fine framework can be up to 20 million euros, or up to 4% of the company’s total global turnover of the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher. The GDPR sets out a number of requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of such EU-based data subjects, including: providing expanded disclosures about how their personal data will be used; higher standards for organizations to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities; the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; new rights for individuals to be “forgotten” and rights to data portability, as well as enhanced current rights (e.g., access requests); the principle of accountability and demonstrating compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit; and the new mandatory data breach regime. In particular, medical or health data, genetic data and biometric data where the latter is used to uniquely identify an individual are all classified as “special category” data under the GDPR and are afforded greater protection and 

28



require additional compliance obligations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities. Due to the strong consumer protection aspects of the GDPR, companies subject to its purview must allocate substantial legal costs to the development of necessary policies and procedures and overall compliance efforts. We expect to incur continued costs associated with maintaining compliance with GDPR into the future.
We will also be subject to evolving EU laws on data export, where we transfer data outside the EU to ourselves, group companies or third parties. The GDPR only permits exports of data outside the EU to jurisdictions that ensure an adequate level of data protection. The United States has not been deemed to offer an adequate level of protection, so in order for us to transfer personal data from the EU to the United States, we must identify a legal basis for data transfer (e.g., the EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses). On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU, or CJEU, issued a landmark opinion in the case Maximilian Schrems vs. Facebook (Case C-311/18), or Schrems II. This decision (a) calls into question commonly relied upon data transfer mechanisms as between the EU member states and the United States (such as the Standard Contractual Clauses) and (b) invalidates the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield on which many companies had relied as an acceptable mechanism for transferring such data from the EU to the United States. The CJEU is the highest court in Europe and the Schrems II decision heightens the burden on data importers to assess U.S. national security laws on their business and future actions of EU data protection authorities are difficult to predict. Consequently, it is an ongoing challenge for data importers like us to identify compliant methods of data transfers necessary for their businesses. There is some risk of data transfers from the EU being halted.

Further, as a result of the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the EU, there has been some uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. While the Data Protection Act of 2018 that “implements” and complements the GDPR achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it was not clear whether a transfer of data from the EEA to the United Kingdom would remain lawful under GDPR as of the end of a Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020, when the United Kingdom was treated as a third country for purposes of the GDPR (and other EU laws). On December 24, 2020, the United Kingdom and the EU reached an agreement in principle on the EU-UK Trade Agreement, or the Trade Agreement. Under the Trade Agreement, for data protection purposes, there is a new transition period of up to six months to enable the European Commission to complete an adequacy assessment of the United Kingdom’s data protection laws. For the time being, personal data can continue to be exported from the EEA to the United Kingdom without a requirement that additional safeguards be adopted, and such transfers will not be prohibited by the GDPR. The new transition period began on January 1, 2021, and ends either (1) on the date which an adequacy decision in relation to the United Kingdom is adopted by the European Commission under the GDPR, or (2) four months after January 1, 2021, which the GDPR shall be extended by two months unless either the EU or the United Kingdom objects. If the European Commission does not reach an adequacy determination regarding United Kingdom data protection laws, transfers of personal data from the EU to the United Kingdom will be prohibited under the GDPR unless EU data exporters take further steps to ensure adequacy for such EU personal data.
