General
 
Yum China is the largest restaurant company in China in terms of 2021 system sales. We had $9.9 billion of revenues in 2021 and over 11,700 restaurants as of December 31, 2021. Our growing restaurant network consists of our flagship KFC and Pizza Hut brands, as well as emerging brands such as Little Sheep, Huang Ji Huang, Lavazza, COFFii & JOY, Taco Bell and East Dawning. 
 
We have the exclusive right to operate and sublicense the KFC, Pizza Hut and, subject to achieving certain agreed-upon milestones, Taco Bell brands in China, excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. We own the intellectual property of the Little Sheep, Huang Ji Huang, COFFii & JOY and East Dawning concepts outright. KFC was the first major global restaurant brand to enter China in 1987. With more than 30 years of operations, we have developed extensive operating experience in the China market. We have since grown to become the largest restaurant company in China in terms of 2021 system sales, with 11,788 restaurants covering over 1,600 cities primarily in China as of December 31, 2021. We believe that there are significant opportunities to expand within China, and we intend to focus our efforts on increasing our geographic footprint in both existing and new cities.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we owned and operated approximately 85% of our restaurants. Franchisees contribute to our revenue through the payment of upfront franchise fees and on-going royalties based on a percentage of sales, and payments for other transactions with us, such as purchases of food and paper products, advertising services and other services.
 
Restaurant Concepts
 
KFC
 
KFC is the leading and the largest quick-service restaurant (“QSR”) brand in China in terms of 2021 system sales. Founded in Corbin, Kentucky by Colonel Harland D. Sanders in 1939, KFC opened its first restaurant in Beijing, China in 1987. As of December 31, 2021, there were over 8,100 KFC restaurants in over 1,600 cities across China. In addition to Original Recipe® chicken and other chicken products, KFC in China has an extensive menu featuring beef burgers, pork, seafood, rice dishes, congees, fresh vegetables, desserts, coffee, tea and many other products. KFC also seeks to increase revenue from different channels, including dine-in, delivery, takeaway and ready meals. KFC primarily competes with western QSR brands in China, such as McDonald’s, Dicos and Burger King, among which we believe KFC had an approximate two-to-one  lead over its nearest competitor in terms of store count as of the end of 2021.

 2021 Form 10-K



Pizza Hut
 
Pizza Hut is the leading and the largest casual dining restaurant (“CDR”) brand in China in terms of 2021 system sales and number of restaurants as of December 31, 2021, offering multiple dayparts, including breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. Since opening its first China restaurant unit in Beijing in 1990, Pizza Hut has grown rapidly and, as of year-end 2021, there were over 2,500 Pizza Hut restaurants in over 600 cities across China. Pizza Hut has an extensive menu offering a broad variety of pizzas, steaks, pasta, rice dishes and other entrees, appetizers, beverages and desserts. Measured by number of restaurants, we believe Pizza Hut has an approximate six-to-one lead over its nearest western CDR competitor in China as of the end of 2021.
 
Other Concepts
 
In addition to KFC and Pizza Hut, our restaurant brand portfolio also includes Little Sheep, Huang Ji Huang, Lavazza, COFFii & JOY, Taco Bell and East Dawning.
Little Sheep. Little Sheep, with its roots in Inner Mongolia, China, specializes in “Hot Pot” cooking, which is very popular in China, particularly during the winter months. Little Sheep had over 240 units in both China and international markets as of December 31, 2021. Of these, 220 units were franchise restaurants.
Huang Ji Huang. In April 2020, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Huang Ji Huang. Founded in 2004, Huang Ji Huang had over 650 units in China and internationally as of December 31, 2021. Huang Ji Huang primarily operates a franchise model and is an industry-leading simmer pot brand.
 
Lavazza. In April 2020, we partnered with Luigi Lavazza S.p.A. (“Lavazza Group”), the world-renowned family-owned Italian coffee company, and established a joint venture (“Lavazza joint venture”), to explore and develop the Lavazza coffee shop concept in China. In September 2021, the Company and Lavazza Group entered into agreements to accelerate the expansion of Lavazza coffee shops, which offer a premium and authentic Italian coffee experience in China. As of December 31, 2021, there were 58 Lavazza units in China. 
 
COFFii & JOY. COFFii & JOY is a coffee concept that we developed in 2018, featuring specialty coffee. As of December 31, 2021, there were 36 COFFii & JOY units in China.
 
Taco Bell. Taco Bell is the world’s leading western QSR brand specializing in Mexican-style food, including tacos, burritos, quesadillas, salads, nachos and similar items. We opened our first Taco Bell restaurant in Shanghai, China, in December 2016. As of December 31, 2021, there were 37 Taco Bell units in China.
 
East Dawning. East Dawning is a Chinese food QSR brand located predominantly in transportation hubs. The brand was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we have decided to wind down the operations of the brand. As of December 31, 2021, there were five East Dawning units in China and all of them are planned to be permanently closed in 2022.
 
Our Strategies
 
Our primary strategy is to grow sales and profits across our portfolio of brands through organic growth, growth of franchise restaurants and development of new restaurant concepts, along with growing our online business. We are accelerating our store network expansion to reach our next milestone of 20,000 stores. We will drive growth from our core brands, as well as emerging brands such as Lavazza. We will continue to invest in digitalization and supply chain, our key growth enablers.
 
Continue to strategically expand our restaurant network 
 
We are confident in the long-term market opportunities in China. We believe we have the potential to grow to 20,000 restaurants or more in the future and we are currently tracking over 1,100 cities that do not have a KFC or Pizza Hut restaurant.

Further expand geographical coverage. Restaurant chains have a low penetration rate in China, especially in lower-tier cities. Given the rapidly expanding middle class and dining out population as a result of continued economic growth and urbanization, we believe there are significant opportunities to expand within China, and we intend to focus our efforts on increasing our geographic footprint in both existing and new cities. For additional information on the risks associated with this growth strategy, see the section entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We may not attain our target development goals; aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales; and new restaurants may not be profitable.”
 
Restaurant development pipeline. We are keen to explore various new restaurant formats to support further store expansion, including different store designs or service models aimed at addressing the needs of different guests and for different occasions. We believe that our first-mover advantage and in-depth local know-how will help us to build robust development pipelines to seize the market opportunities.
 
Franchise opportunity. While we continue to focus on the operation of our Company-owned restaurant units, we will also continue to seek franchise opportunities for both our core and emerging brands. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 15% of our restaurants were operated by franchisees. We anticipate high franchisee demand for our brands, supported by strong unit economics, operational consistency and multiple store formats to drive restaurant growth. While the franchise market in China is still in an early stage compared to developed markets, we plan to continue to develop our franchisee-owned store portfolio over time, especially in select channels such as gas stations.
 
Grow emerging brands. Our key growth strategy for emerging brands, such as Little Sheep, Huang Ji Huang, Lavazza, COFFii & JOY and Taco Bell, focuses on exploring suitable business models to achieve sustainable growth. In addition, we plan to continue our efforts in product innovation and operational enhancement for these emerging brands to potentially scale up operations in the future.
 
Continue to improve unit-level performance and develop new sources of revenue
 
Food innovation and value proposition. We will continue to focus on food innovation and strengthen our value proposition. We are keenly aware of the strength of our core menu items. At the same time, we seek to continue to introduce innovative items to meet evolving consumer preferences and local tastes, drive guest engagement and continue to broaden our brand appeal. Each of our restaurant concepts has proprietary menu items, and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients. We will continue to develop unique recipes, regionally-inspired menu items and special seasonings to provide appealing, tasty and convenient food choices at competitive prices. In addition, KFC plans to continue providing value with product offerings such as the bucket and increased combo options throughout the day and Pizza Hut plans to continue its multiple value campaigns. KFC and Pizza Hut will continue to promote their respective signature value campaigns “Crazy Thursday” and “Scream Wednesday,” which offer selected menu items at attractive prices, and have received positive consumer feedback. We believe our continued food innovation and value proposition are pivotal to enhancing our unit-level performance by driving order frequency and order ticket size.
 
Daypart opportunities. We believe there are significant daypart opportunities across our brands. For example, KFC has expanded its daypart offerings, including late night street food and afternoon tea, and Pizza Hut continued to drive sales from breakfast and business lunch. 
 
Best in-store experience. We continuously look for ways to improve the guest experience. For example, we plan to continue to invest in refurbishing our restaurants. Our brands also look to improve efficiency to drive sales growth. For instance, we have simplified menus and fine-tuned our in-store self-service order devices. We are also expanding our delivery business through our proprietary smartphone applications and pre-order services. To further enhance the guest experience, we are also evaluating the possibility of adopting other digital initiatives in our restaurants and will continue to invest in this area, as discussed more fully below.

Continue to invest in technology, with a focus to capture digital, delivery and off-premise consumption opportunities
 
We will continue to invest in technology to further empower and maintain our competitive advantages. We will focus on improving our overall technology infrastructure and digital and delivery capabilities. We believe these efforts will further support our sustainable growth, improve our operational efficiency and ensure quality. Our digital and delivery strategies are set forth below.
 
Digital. As of December 31, 2021, our loyalty programs had over 330 million members and approximately 110 million members for KFC and Pizza Hut, respectively. The programs have been effective in increasing order frequency and enhancing guest loyalty. Digital orders accounted for approximately 86% of KFC and Pizza Hut Company sales in 2021. Going forward, we will continue to leverage our powerful digital ecosystem to drive sales, improve the guest experience and increase operational efficiency. We plan to increase our investment in end-to-end digitalization, automation and artificial intelligence (“AI”), to more effectively connect online traffic with our offline assets. To improve our operational efficiency, we will focus on connecting our front-end, guest facing systems to back-end systems such as operations and supply chain.
 
Delivery. China is a world leader in the emerging online to offline, or O2O, market. This is where digital online ordering technologies interact with traditional brick and mortar retail to enhance the customer experience. We see considerable growth potential in the delivery market by aligning our proven restaurant operation capabilities with our delivery network that offers consumers the ability to order restaurant food anywhere. Delivery contributed approximately 32% of Company sales in 2021. Going forward, we will continue to optimize our delivery service by adopting innovative technologies, rolling out new delivery menu items and developing novel delivery service concepts, such as our rainy-day delivery menu.
 
New retail. As part of our strategy to drive growth from off-premise occasions, our new retail products are designed to capture at-home consumption demand by leveraging our online and offline channels. We launched ready meals such as fried rice, steak and pasta, as well as coffee capsules so customers can enjoy these products any time they want.  We intend to continue to capture the opportunity with our capabilities in product innovation, supply chain and online and offline assets.
 
Strategically expand our restaurant portfolio
 
We aim to maintain our industry-leading position in the QSR and CDR markets in China with our core brands, and gain a stronger foothold and enhanced know-how in the Chinese cuisine space, which represents a significant share of the restaurant industry in China. In April 2020, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Huang Ji Huang, a leading Chinese CDR franchise business. Following the acquisition of Huang Ji Huang, we established a Chinese dining business unit to manage our Chinese restaurant brands. 
 
We are also building a coffee portfolio to capture today’s underserved coffee market in China across different customer segments, including coffee products provided by KFC (“K-Coffee”), which offers convenience and value, balanced by our incubated concept COFFii & JOY, which offers specialty coffee for coffee lovers. In 2021, we sold 170 million cups of coffee at KFC. In April 2020, we also partnered with Lavazza to explore and develop the Lavazza coffee shop concept in China, targeting to open 1,000 Lavazza stores by 2025, to offer premium and authentic Italian coffee in an indulgent atmosphere. As of December 31, 2021, there were 58 Lavazza units in China. 
 
Prudently pursue investments in high-quality assets
 
Our investment strategy primarily focuses on three areas, restaurant brands with excellent growth potential and synergy, joint ventures and the enablers that empower our brands (e.g. ecosystem, technology). We continue to identify and evaluate investment opportunities in high-quality brands to capture growth opportunities. Also, we look for potential opportunities to invest in digitalization and supply chain, our key growth enablers, to further enhance our competitiveness. We will prudently assess investment targets based on each candidate’s strategic value, brand equity, business scale and financial performance, among other factors.

Operational Management
 
Restaurant Unit Management
 
Our restaurant management structure varies among our restaurant brands and restaurant size. Generally, each restaurant that we operate is led by a restaurant general manager, or RGM, together with one or more assistant managers. RGMs are skilled and highly trained, with most having a college-level education. The performance of RGMs is regularly monitored and coached by senior operations leaders. Each restaurant brand issues detailed manuals, which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs. These manuals set forth standards and requirements for all aspects of restaurant operations. The restaurant management team is responsible for the day-to-day operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards. Each RGM is also responsible for handling guest complaints and emergency situations.
Franchise Restaurant Management
 
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 15% of our restaurants were franchise restaurants. Our franchise program is designed to promote consistency and quality, and we are selective in granting franchises. Franchisees supply capital initially by paying a franchise fee to us and by purchasing or leasing the land use rights, building, equipment, signs, seating, inventories and supplies; and, over the longer term, by reinvesting in the business through expansion. Franchisees contribute to our revenue through the payment of upfront franchise fees and on-going royalties based on a percentage of sales, and payments for other transactions with us, such as purchases of food and paper products, advertising services and other services. 
 
Our franchise agreements set out specific operational standards, which are consistent with standards required for Company-owned restaurants. Like our Company-owned restaurants, our franchise restaurants are also subject to our internal quality audits and reviews. There are no notable operational differences between Company-owned restaurants and franchise restaurants.
 
We believe that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with our franchisees and their representatives. To this end, the Company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisees and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business, including products, equipment, operational improvements and standards and management techniques. 
 
Expansion Management
 
We believe that there are significant opportunities to expand within China and we intend to focus our efforts on increasing our geographic footprint in both existing and new cities. We expanded our restaurant count from 7,562 at the end of 2016 to 11,788 at the end of 2021, representing a CAGR of approximately 9%. We expect to expand our business through organic growth, growth of franchise units and development of our emerging brands. 
 
Our expansion strategy has been systematically focused on high potential locations across city tiers, including entering new commercial areas within existing cities and new cities. Each potential restaurant site is assessed and evaluated individually based on its site potential, potential financial return and potential impact to nearby stores. We take into account factors such as economic and demographic conditions and prospects, consumption patterns, GDP per capita and population density of the local community, presence of activity centers such as shopping complexes, schools and residential areas that generate guest traffic, and the presence of other restaurants in the vicinity during our site selection process. We also consider the guest traffic and distance from the existing restaurants under the same brand to reduce sales transfer that may occur from existing restaurant units. As we are opening more smaller format stores and actively managing costs, the average capital spending for each new KFC and Pizza Hut restaurant unit in 2021 was approximately RMB1.5 to 2.5 million.

 2021 Form 10-K



Supply Chain Management
 
The Company’s restaurants, including those operated by franchisees, are large purchasers of a number of food and paper products, equipment and other restaurant supplies. The principal items purchased include protein ingredients (including poultry, pork, beef and seafood), cheese, oil, flour, vegetables and paper and packaging materials. The Company has not experienced any significant, continuous shortages of supplies, and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available. Prices paid for supplies fluctuate. When prices increase, the brands may attempt to pass on such increases to customers, although there is no assurance that this can be done practically. We also control our raw material costs by entering into long-term bulk purchase agreements for our key food ingredients.
 
The Company partners with over 800 independent suppliers, which are mostly China-based. We implement a strict supplier qualification process that includes supplier compliance checks and on-site audits to ensure the supplier meets our food safety and quality control standards. We have formulated detailed specifications for food ingredients and consumables we procure. We believe supply chain management is crucial to the sustainability of our business and we are dedicated to applying digitalization and automation technologies in our supply chain management system. Our in-house and integrated supply chain management system employs more than 1,400 staff in food safety, quality assurance, procurement management, logistics, engineering and supply chain system.
 
In addition, we operate a tailor-made, world-class logistics management system, which is capable of accommodating large scale, wide coverage and advanced information dissemination as well as fast store expansions. To further strengthen our supply chain network, the Company acquired land in 2021 to build three new logistics centers. The Company, along with multiple independently owned and operated distributors, utilizes 32 logistics centers to distribute supplies to Company-owned and franchised stores, as well as to third-party customers. In addition, the Company owns seasoning facilities for its Chinese dining business unit, which manufacture and sell seasoning products to Huang Ji Huang and Little Sheep franchisees. The Company’s supply chain strategy of working with multiple suppliers, as well as building a vast logistics network, allows for continuous supply of products in the event that supply from an individual supplier or logistics center becomes unfeasible.
 
To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our procurement process, the Company has adopted a central procurement model, whereby the Company centrally purchases the vast majority of food and paper products from approved suppliers for most of the restaurants regardless of ownership. The Company believes this central procurement model allows the Company to maintain quality control and achieves better prices and terms through volume purchases. 
 
Food Safety and Quality Control
 
Food safety is the top priority at the Company. Food safety systems include rigorous standards and training of employees in our restaurants and distribution system, as well as requirements for suppliers. These standards and training topics include, but are not limited to, employee health, product handling, ingredient and product temperature management and prevention of cross contamination. Food safety training is focused on illness prevention, food safety and regulation adherence in day-to-day operations. Our standards also promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations in China when building new or renovating existing restaurants. For further information on food safety issues, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Food safety and foodborne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.”
 
Our quality assurance department regularly conducts unannounced food safety and operation excellence checks of all restaurants covering food safety, product quality and guest service. We also conduct regular product quality inspections on main menu items, and perform microbiological testing of restaurants’ utensils, small wares, water, ice and food to ensure they meet the required standards.
 
For our delivery system, we have established our delivery service teams for KFC and Pizza Hut. We require all third-party delivery partners to sign and strictly implement a letter of commitment on the food safety and quality practice of delivery food, which stipulates clear requirements for regulatory compliance, staff management, catering, delivery facilities, equipment and strict management of third-party platforms.

Innovation and Digitalization
 
Our vision is to become the world’s most innovative pioneer in the restaurant industry. We are dedicated to adopting innovations in our business model and restaurant operations, which enables us to comprehensively reach our guests and provide superior products and services in a technology-driven and happy way, as vividly demonstrated by our slogan "Tasty food, great fun, pleasant presentation with substance". 
 
We believe we are a pioneer and first-mover among restaurant brands in China in utilizing and investing in emerging digital technologies to modernize our business operations and accelerate our growth, which is critical to empower and maintain our competitive advantage in China. In recent years, we have stepped up our investment in digitalization, embarking on end-to-end digitalization of our business operations. In 2021, we opened a digital R&D center with three sites in Shanghai, Nanjing and Xi’an, to strengthen our internal digital capabilities and support sustainable business growth by using advanced technology.
 
Dining Experience
 
Menu Innovations
 
Offering appealing, tasty and convenient food at great prices is our value proposition. We have a dedicated food innovation team primarily focusing on the development and innovation of new recipes and improvement of existing products. In 2021, we launched over 500 new and improved products across all of our restaurant brands. Leveraging our local know-how and the wealth of consumer taste preference data accumulated, we have become a pioneer in food innovation, pushing the boundaries of QSR and CDR dining in China. 
 
Our menu innovation endeavors are also supported by a world-class 27,000 square-foot innovation center in Shanghai for the development of new recipes, cooking methods and menu concepts. The innovation center is an integrated research and development facility that has been designed to generate new menu ideas and concepts with new ingredients and cooking methods to enable the rapid roll-out of innovative products catering to customers’ local tastes. 
 
Ordering
 
KFC rolled out mobile pre-ordering service on a nationwide basis in December 2016, which allows guests to order online and pick up in store. Pizza Hut launched table-side mobile ordering in 2018, which enables guests to order by scanning a QR code with their mobile phone. Now mobile ordering is a standard feature of our Super Apps including the KFC Super App and the Pizza Hut Super App. Guests can also order through our proprietary mini programs embedded in WeChat. In addition, in certain commercial districts, in-store kiosks provide guests with convenient and fast digital ordering options. We continuously enhance our Super Apps to address the needs of customers and improve their digital experience. For example, in 2021, we launched a personalized menu display in the KFC Super App and introduced an “order together” feature in the Pizza Hut Super App. In 2021, digital orders accounted for approximately 86% of KFC and Pizza Hut Company sales.

 2021 Form 10-K



Payment
 
As early as June 2015, we started to partner with Alipay on digital payment functionalities, making us among the first batch of restaurant chains in China to make mobile payment available to guests. We commenced mobile payment cooperation with WeChat Pay in 2016. Digital payments accounted for an increasing percentage of our Company sales, from 33% in 2016 to 61% in 2017, and further to 81% in 2018, 91% in 2019, 97% in 2020 and 98% in 2021. The increasing percentage indicates growing consumer preference for this feature and reflects our ability to harness the power of technology in our business model. Adoption of digital and mobile payment technologies not only provides a better customer experience by, among other things, reducing guest waiting time and saving guests from having to reach for their wallets or even cellphones, but also reduces staffing needed for cash management and reduces potential risks associated with cash management. In addition to the above business relationships with major third-party mobile payment providers, we developed and launched YUMC Pay in partnership with UnionPay in the first quarter of 2019.
 
We were the first in the world to commercially implement facial recognition technologies for payment by introducing “Smile to Pay” in Hangzhou’s KFC restaurant in September 2017. "Smile to Pay" enables our guests to make payments for their orders at digital kiosks without having to reach for their wallets. Following positive feedback, we have since implemented “Smile to Pay” in approximately 1,600 KFC restaurants across China as of December 31, 2021. 
 
Guest loyalty and interaction
 
China has entered into an age of Super Apps, which integrates multiple functions including messaging, e-commerce and payments in a single application by embedding mini programs or providing in-App links to other applications. In early 2016, the KFC Super App was implemented nationwide. Super Apps play a very important role in our overall digital ecosystem as they enable a digital guest experience by offering convenience, efficiency and interesting functionality before, during and after dining. 
 
Member engagement is fostered through our Super Apps and WeChat mini programs, as these form the primary platform for consumers to sign up for our membership programs. Additionally, we continue to monetize our membership base by introducing privilege membership subscription programs that increase frequency and spend at our brands. These monetization opportunities rely heavily on our ability to engage with our users through our Super Apps. As of December 31, 2021, KFC and Pizza Hut loyalty programs exceeded 360 million members combined. Member sales increased to approximately 60% of system sales in 2021. We believe that creative and engaging interactions with our guests can help us enhance the guest experience and guest loyalty, which will ultimately lead to increased sales.
 
Delivery
 
We believe that food delivery is a significant growth driver in China. We were one of the first restaurant businesses in China to offer delivery services. As early as 2010, KFC established its own delivery platform and started to accept delivery orders placed on its mobile applications. Starting from 2015, we were also one of the first to partner with O2O aggregators to further generate delivery traffic. In addition to ordering through aggregators’ platforms, guests may also place delivery orders through the KFC and Pizza Hut Super Apps. The ability to generate orders from our own channels allows us to be well-positioned in commercial collaborations with aggregators, and manage costs and commissions in a more competitive manner. In 2021, approximately one-third of KFC delivery sales, and approximately 20% of Pizza Hut delivery sales, were generated from our own channels. 
 
10
 2021 Form 10-K



In the past, we either used our own dedicated riders to deliver orders placed through aggregators’ platforms or paid an additional commission for the delivery services provided by aggregators. Starting in 2019, we used our own dedicated riders to deliver orders placed through aggregators’ platforms to customers of KFC and Pizza Hut stores, which we believe will give us greater control over delivery quality and improve our ability to make timely deliveries during peak hours. These dedicated riders are either contracted with us or the aggregators’ platforms to deliver orders exclusively for KFC or Pizza Hut stores. In 2019, Company sales through delivery accounted for approximately 21% of total Company sales, which further increased to approximately 30% for 2020 and 32% in 2021, partially driven by the increased delivery orders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Restaurant Format Innovation
 
To supplement our growth, we are focusing on developing new restaurant formats and upgrading existing restaurants. We have developed multiple restaurant formats to meet different guest needs. For example, our smaller store formats, with reduced store size combined with other cost reduction initiatives, enable us to penetrate further into lower-tier cities and expand more flexibly in higher-tier cities. In addition, we continuously look for ways to improve the guest experience. We have accelerated restaurant upgrades and remodeling to implement the latest technology, equipment and infrastructure and improve the dining experience. Approximately 78% of KFC restaurant units and 89% of Pizza Hut restaurant units as of December 31, 2021 were remodeled or built in the past five years. Our brands also look to improve efficiency to drive sales growth. For example, we have simplified our menu items and fine-tuned our in-store self-service order kiosks.
Operational Efficiency
 
We have made significant investments to establish an efficient technological infrastructure, which serves as the foundation of our intelligent restaurant network management and facilitates efficient and innovative restaurant operation for all restaurants across our brands. We have adopted AI-enabled technology to analyze and forecast transaction volume so that we can improve labor scheduling and inventory management. For example, the “Super Brain,” an end-to-end AI-enabled system, integrates data from store operations and aids the decision making of restaurant general managers. Moreover, managers and staff are also equipped with self-designed "smart watches", and in some pilot stores, "smart glasses", to closely monitor the real-time ordering and serving procedures of the restaurants and make timely staffing adjustments, which substantially improves management efficiency and guest satisfaction. We believe our digitalization along with automation, the Internet of Things and AI work together to enhance food safety, replace manual work and improve overall store efficiency.
Intellectual Property
 
Our use of certain material trademarks and service marks is governed by a master license agreement between Yum Restaurants Consulting (Shanghai) Company Limited (“YCCL”), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, and Yum! Brands Inc. (“YUM”), through YRI China Franchising LLC, a subsidiary of YUM, effective from January 1, 2020 and previously through Yum! Restaurants Asia Pte. Ltd., another subsidiary of YUM, from October 31, 2016 to December 31, 2019. Pursuant to the master license agreement, we are the exclusive licensee of the KFC, Pizza Hut and, subject to achieving certain agreed-upon milestones, Taco Bell brands and their related marks and other intellectual property rights for restaurant services in the PRC, excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. The term of the license is 50 years with automatic renewals for additional consecutive renewal terms of 50 years each, subject only to us being in “good standing” and unless we give notice of our intent not to renew. In exchange, we pay a license fee to YUM equal to 3% of net system sales of the licensed brands. We have also agreed generally not to compete with YUM. In addition, we were granted a right of first refusal to develop and franchise in the PRC certain restaurant concepts that YUM may develop or acquire. 
 
We were granted by YUM a royalty-free license to use the name and mark of “YUM” as part of our name, domain name and stock identification symbol pursuant to a name license agreement entered into between YUM and us on October 31, 2016. The name license agreement can be terminated by YUM in the event of, among other things, material breach of the agreement by us. Our use of certain other material intellectual property (including intellectual property in product recipes, restaurant operation and restaurant design) is likewise governed by the master license agreement with YUM.

We own registered trademarks and service marks relating to the Little Sheep, Huang Ji Huang, COFFii & JOY and East Dawning brands and pay no license fee related to these brands. Collectively, these licensed and owned marks have significant value and are important to our business. Our policy is to pursue registration of our important intellectual property rights whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our rights.
Competition
 
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China indicates that sales in the consumer food service market in China totaled approximately $738 billion in 2021. Industry conditions vary by region, with local Chinese restaurants and western chains present, but we possess the largest market share (as measured by system sales). While branded QSR units per million population in China are well below that of the United States, competition in China is increasing. We compete with respect to food taste, quality, value, service, convenience, restaurant location and concept, including delivery and shared kitchens. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and disposable income. We compete not only for consumers but also for management and hourly personnel and suitable restaurant sites. KFC's competitors in China are primarily western QSR brands such as McDonald's, Dicos and Burger King, and to a lesser extent, domestic QSR brands in China. Pizza Hut primarily competes with western CDR brands, including Domino's and Papa John's, as well as other domestic CDR brands in China.
Seasonality
 
Due to the nature of our operations, we typically generate higher sales during Chinese festivities, holiday seasons as well as summer months, but relatively lower sales and lower operating profit during the second and fourth quarters. 
Human Capital Management
 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had around 450,000 employees, including approximately 147,000 full-time employees and approximately 303,000 part-time restaurant crew members. Our full-time employees primarily included 38,000 restaurant management team members and 102,000 restaurant crew members.
 
Our board of directors provides oversight on certain human capital matters, including inclusion and diversity, management succession planning, and our employee rewards and benefits program. Under the board’s oversight, the Company regularly conducts a people planning review to attract, retain and develop a workforce that aligns with our values and strategies.
 
Culture and People Philosophy
 
The Company is committed to the “People First” philosophy by implementing our principle of “Fair, Care, Pride”, which includes building employability, creating a diverse and inclusive working environment, providing fair and competitive benefits, empowering employees through digitalization and prioritizing occupational health and safety.
Diversity, Inclusion and Equal Opportunities
 
The Company is committed to fostering a working environment that is professional, inclusive and non-discriminatory for employees to unleash their potential. In our workplaces, differences are understood, appreciated and encouraged. Each employee, without regard to race, religion, color, age, gender or gender identity, disability, military or veteran status, sexual orientation, citizenship or national origin, is provided with fair opportunity on the Company’s diverse platform.

The Company strives to create a barrier-free and inclusive workplace for people with disabilities. The Company piloted the first “Angel Restaurant” in 2012, using modified equipment and operational processes, and provides trainings to assist “angel employees” – those with special needs – to perform a full range of jobs. By the end of 2021, we had opened 23 Angel Restaurants in 22 cities, providing jobs for over 200 people with special needs.
Training and Development
 
The Company values the growth of employees and continuously nurtures top talent through a systematic training system. Every employee is required to formulate a specific development goal to improve their competencies in addition to completing the key objectives of the role. We prepare employees not just for fulfilling current job requirements, but also for more challenging expanded job responsibilities in the future. In 2021, the number of total training hours exceeded 12 million.
Building Talent Pipeline
 
The Company is well-known for its career development path - the “Bench Planning” -- which enables most operation leaders to grow from within. Two signature programs – the KFC Business School and the Pizza Hut Management Institute - provide systematic training and development opportunities. A new college graduate can advance to RGMs in less than two years by participating in these programs and acquiring the operational, financial and managerial knowledge required for operating a restaurant. In the long run, the programs lay a solid foundation for their future success. 
 
The Company offers a tailored and fast-tracked YUMC Management Trainee Program for fresh graduate trainees in its marketing and supply chain functions. Through job rotations and targeted trainings, they are offered an opportunity to gain a thorough understanding of the business and build a foundation for becoming industry-leading professionals.
 
Digitally-powered Training Platform
 
Our training programs have tapped into the digitalization trends through the mobile learning platform, with the goal of equipping employees with the knowledge and skills necessary in the digital era and enabling their sustainable career development. The employees can easily access these training programs, even during the pandemic when face-to-face trainings may not be available. 
Continuing Education Program
 
The Company sponsors a continuing education program to help employees obtain college degrees. By the end of 2021, 3,800 employees were granted subsidies and achieved higher education degrees through our continuing education program.

Total Rewards and Employee Benefits
 
The Company is committed to equal pay for equal work. Based on annual market research, it provides employees with fair and competitive compensation and benefits, recognizing and rewarding their contributions, performance and efforts. 
 
In line with relevant labor laws and regulations, we provide full-time employees with pension insurance, medical insurance, unemployment insurance, work injury insurance and maternity insurance. Part-time employees are covered by employer liability insurance. Employees also enjoy paid leaves in accordance with labor laws. 
 
The Company has launched equity incentive schemes such as CEO Awards and RGM Restricted Stock Units (RSUs). The scheme is part of Yum China’s long-standing commitment to its RGM No. 1 corporate culture. The Company believes that its RGMs serve as the most important leaders and are key contributors to its long-term success. In 2016, Yum China announced a grant of RSUs valued at $2,000 to each qualified RGM. As of the end of 2021, this program has allowed more than 10,700 RGMs to become stockholders of Yum China. In addition, the Company granted RSUs valued at $3,000 to all eligible RGMs starting in February 2021, covering approximately 3,500 RGMs. The turnover rate of RGMs was 10.6% in 2021.
 
Recognizing the tremendous effort of our employees especially in navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company upgraded the medical insurance coverage of its front-line employees. Medical insurance coverage for each eligible RGM was increased to RMB 1 million. Critical illness insurance was extended to service team leaders and coverage was increased for family members of both RGMs and other restaurant management team members. These enhanced benefits are expected to cover around 100,000 front-line employees and their family members. 
 
For office staff, the Company expanded its flexible benefit platform in 2021 to cover more than 6,000 employees, allowing employees, based on their individual needs, to select benefits including family medical insurance, medical examination and recreational activities. Both office staff and RGMs are covered by the Company’s housing subsidy scheme. 
 
Health and Safety
 
The Company strictly complies with laws and regulations on safety and health. For activities imposing higher or distinct risks, the Company implements health and safety measures specifically formulated to protect employees against those risks. Yum China also incorporates compliance management, risk controls, inspections and supervisions in daily operations. The Company regularly inspects and upgrades employees’ protective equipment, carries out workplace safety reviews, and trains all employees on the operation procedures and safety precautions. 
 
The Company continues to place top priority on the health and safety of employees amid the fluid COVID-19 conditions. To further protect the health and safety of employees and customers, the Company encourages and rewards employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19. 
 
In addition, Yum China’s Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”) continues to provide professional counseling and educational sessions to promote employees’ physical and mental health. For example, by leveraging the EAP program, the Company was able to offer stress management tips to employees when they underwent quarantine during the pandemic. 
 
Engagement and Wellbeing
 
The Top Employers Institute has certified the Company as a Top Employer China for the fourth consecutive year, with Yum China being the only restaurant company named among the top 20 employers. 
 
The Company maintains multiple communication channels with employees, including organizational forums such as RGM Convention and Founders’ Day. The Company also ensures effective communication of business strategies and corporate messages through various digital platforms such as corporate WeChat, Apps and intranet portals.

Environmental Matters
 
We strive to reduce the environmental impact of our business activities and incorporate sustainability into the daily operations of our restaurants, focusing our effort on climate action, managing supply chain environmental impact, using sustainable packaging and waste management. 
Climate Action 
 
Climate action is a focus area for Yum China. We established a management system with specific goals and continuously leverage energy-saving technology to reduce electricity consumption and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. We disclose the impacts of environmental risks and opportunities in our annual sustainability report and CDP questionnaires. In 2021, we announced our commitment to supporting the Paris Agreement by setting science-based emissions reduction targets in line with the Science Based Target initiative (“SBTi”) criteria, and striving for net-zero value chain GHG emissions by 2050.
Supply Chain Environmental Impact
 
Building a sustainable supply chain is a key component of our sustainability strategy. We have set an ambitious goal to collaborate with our suppliers to achieve a zero-deforestation supply chain. By continuously strengthening the management of traceability in the upstream supply chain, we strive to promote sustainable sourcing of commodities, including our goal of sourcing 100% RSPO-certified palm oil and 100% FSC-certified paper packaging by 2025. 
Sustainable Packaging
 
We continue to reduce packaging and waste from the source of use through the application of new packaging solutions, new materials, innovative technologies and various other methods. We are committed to ensuring that all customer facing, plastic-based packaging will be recyclable. We are working towards our target of a 30% reduction of non-degradable plastic packaging weight by 2025, as compared to a 2019 baseline. 
Food Loss and Waste 
 
We are working towards a goal of 10% reduction of food waste per restaurant by 2030, as compared to a 2020 baseline, through use of advanced technologies and innovative equipment. To reduce food waste, we continue to promote and extend our food bank project to more restaurants. With our pilot project on converting used cooking oil into biodiesel, we are committed to expanding this project to cover more restaurants.
Nutrition
 
We advocate a balanced diet and healthy eating habits through product innovation and other relevant measures. We have increased the offering of grains, fruits and vegetables, beans and nuts in our menus to create balanced food choices. In 2007, we partnered with the China Nutrition Society (CNS) to establish the China Nutrition Society (CNS) - Yum China Dietary Health Foundation. We cooperate with the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation (CFPA) to encourage donations from the public to improve child nutrition in poor areas.

Our History
 
Yum China was incorporated in Delaware on April 1, 2016. The Company separated from YUM on October 31, 2016 (the “separation”), becoming an independent, publicly traded company as a result of a pro rata distribution (the “distribution”) of all outstanding shares of Yum China common stock to shareholders of YUM. On October 31, 2016, YUM’s shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 19, 2016 received one share of Yum China common stock for every one share of YUM common stock held as of the record date. Common stock of Yum China began trading “regular way” under the ticker symbol “YUMC” on the New York Stock Exchange on November 1, 2016. On September 10, 2020, the Company completed its secondary listing on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (“HKEX”) under the stock code “9987”, in connection with a global offering (the “Global Offering”) of shares of its common stock.

Government Regulation
 
The Company is subject to various laws affecting its business, including laws and regulations concerning cybersecurity, data privacy and security, labor, health, sanitation, environmental protection and safety. In accordance with the relevant laws and regulations in the PRC, we are required to obtain various approvals, licenses, permits, registrations and filings to operate our restaurant business, including the relevant food business license, environmental protection assessment and inspection registration or approval, and fire safety inspection acceptance approval or other alternatives. The Company has not historically been materially and adversely affected by such requirements or by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required approvals, licenses, permits, registrations or filings. The Company is also subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment, as well as anti-bribery and corruption laws. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. However, we cannot predict the effect that the compliance with laws and regulations may have on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position in the future. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, provincial, local and international governmental regulation of our business.
Regulations Relating to Dividend Distribution
 
The Chinese laws, rules and regulations applicable to our China subsidiaries permit payments of dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with applicable accounting standards and regulations. In addition, under Chinese law, an enterprise incorporated in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, after making up previous years’ accumulated losses, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of such a fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. As a result, our China subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to us in the form of dividends. At the discretion of their board of directors, as enterprises incorporated in China, our China subsidiaries may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on China accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends.
Regulations Relating to Taxation
 
Enterprise Income Tax. Under the China Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”) and its implementation rules, a China resident enterprise is subject to Chinese enterprise income tax in respect of its net taxable income derived from sources inside and outside China. The term “resident enterprise” refers to any enterprise established in China and any enterprise established outside China with a “de facto management body” within China.
 
Our China subsidiaries are regarded as China resident enterprises by virtue of their incorporation in China, and are generally subject to Chinese enterprise income tax on their worldwide income at the current uniform rate of 25%, unless reduced under certain specific qualifying criteria. Our China subsidiaries may deduct reasonable expenses that are actually incurred and are related to the generation of their income, including interest and other borrowing expenses, amortization of land use rights and depreciation of buildings and certain fixed assets, subject to any restrictions that may be imposed under the EIT Law, its implementation regulations and any applicable tax notices and circulars issued by the Chinese government or tax authorities.
 
Yum China and each subsidiary of Yum China that is organized outside of China intends to conduct its management functions in a manner that does not cause it to be a China resident enterprise, including by carrying on its day-to-day management activities and maintaining its key records, such as resolutions of its board of directors and resolutions of stockholders, outside of China. As such, we do not believe that Yum China or any of its non-Chinese subsidiaries should be considered a China resident enterprise for purposes of the EIT Law, and should not be subject to Chinese enterprise income tax on that basis. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Under the EIT Law, if we are classified as a China resident enterprise for Chinese enterprise income tax purposes, such classification would likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-Chinese stockholders.”

Value-Added Tax / Business Tax and Local Surcharges. Effective on May 1, 2016, a 6% value-added tax (“VAT”) on output replaced the 5% business tax (“BT”) that has historically been applied to certain restaurant sales under the China Provisional Regulations on Business Tax. Pursuant to Circular Caishui [2016] No. 36 jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance and the Chinese State Taxation Administration (“STA”), beginning May 1, 2016, any entity engaged in the provision of catering services in China is generally required to pay VAT at the rate of 6% on revenues generated from the provision of such services, less any creditable VAT already paid or borne by such entity upon purchase of materials and services. The latest VAT rates imposed on our purchase of materials and services included 13%, 9% and 6%, which were gradually changed from 17%, 13%, 11% and 6% since 2017. These rate changes impact our input VAT on all materials and certain services, primarily construction, transportation and leasing. However, the impact on our operating results is not expected to be significant. Local surcharges generally ranging from 7% to 13%, varying with the location of the relevant China subsidiary, are imposed on the amount of VAT payable.
 
Repatriation of Dividends from Our China Subsidiaries. Dividends (if any) paid by our China subsidiaries to their direct offshore parent company are subject to Chinese withholding income tax at the rate of 10%, provided that such dividends are not effectively connected with any establishment or place of the offshore parent company in China. The 10% withholding income tax rate may be reduced or exempted pursuant to the provisions of any applicable tax treaties or tax arrangements. Hong Kong has a tax arrangement with mainland China that provides for a 5% withholding tax on dividends upon meeting certain conditions and requirements, including, among others, that the Hong Kong resident enterprise directly owns at least 25% equity interests of the Chinese enterprise and is a “beneficial owner” of the dividends. We believe that our Hong Kong subsidiary, which is the equity holder of our Chinese subsidiaries, met the relevant requirements pursuant to the tax arrangement between mainland China and Hong Kong in 2018 and is expected to meet the requirements in subsequent years, thus, it is more likely than not that our dividends declared or earnings expected to be repatriated since 2018 are subject to the reduced withholding tax of 5%. However, if our Hong Kong subsidiary is not considered to be the “beneficial owner” of the dividends by the Chinese local tax authority, the withholding tax rate on dividends paid to it by our Chinese subsidiaries would be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10% with retrospective effect, which would increase our tax liability and reduce the amount of cash available to the Company. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—We rely to a significant extent on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our principal operating subsidiaries in China to fund offshore cash requirements.” 
 
Gains on Direct Disposal of Equity Interests in Our China Subsidiaries. Under the EIT Law and its implementation rules, gains derived by non-resident enterprises from the sale of equity interests in a China resident enterprise are subject to Chinese withholding income tax at the rate of 10%. The 10% withholding income tax rate may be reduced or exempted pursuant to applicable tax treaties or tax arrangements. The gains are computed based on the difference between the sales proceeds and the original investment basis. Stamp duty is also payable upon a direct transfer of equity interest in a China resident enterprise. The stamp duty is calculated at 0.05% on the transfer value, payable by each of the transferor and transferee. We may be subject to these taxes in the event of any future sale by us of a China resident enterprise.

Gains on Indirect Disposal of Equity Interests in Our China Subsidiaries. In February 2015, the STA issued the STA’s Bulletin on Several Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Income Arising from Indirect Transfers of Property by Non-resident Enterprises (“Bulletin 7”). Pursuant to Bulletin 7, an “indirect transfer” of Chinese taxable assets, including equity interests in a China resident enterprise (“Chinese interests”), by a non-resident enterprise, may be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of Chinese taxable assets, if such arrangement does not have reasonable commercial purpose and the transferor avoids payment of Chinese enterprise income tax. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” of Chinese interests by disposing of equity interests in an offshore holding company, the transferor, transferee and/or the China resident enterprise being indirectly transferred may report such indirect transfer to the relevant Chinese tax authority, which may in turn report upward to the STA. Using general anti-tax avoidance provisions, the STA may treat such indirect transfer as a direct transfer of Chinese interests if the transfer avoids Chinese tax by way of an arrangement without reasonable commercial purpose. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to Chinese enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer would be obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of up to 10% of the capital gain in the case of an indirect transfer of equity interests in a China resident enterprise. Both the transferor and the party obligated to withhold the applicable taxes may be subject to penalties under Chinese tax laws if the transferor fails to pay the taxes and the party obligated to withhold the applicable taxes fails to withhold the taxes.
 
The above regulations do not apply if either (i) the selling non-resident enterprise recognizes the relevant gain by purchasing and selling equity of the same listed enterprise in the open market (the “listed enterprise exception”); or (ii) the selling non-resident enterprise would have been exempted from enterprise income tax in China pursuant to applicable tax treaties or tax arrangements, if it had directly held and transferred such Chinese interests that were indirectly transferred. The China indirect transfer rules do not apply to gains recognized by individual stockholders.  However, in practice, there have been a few reported cases of individuals being taxed on the indirect transfer of Chinese interests and the law could be changed so as to apply to individual stockholders, possibly with retroactive effect. In addition, the PRC Individual Income Tax Law and relevant regulations (“IITL”), revised effective January 1, 2019, impose general anti-avoidance tax rules (“GAAR”) on transactions conducted by individuals. As a result, if the China tax authority invokes the GAAR and deems that indirect transfers made by individual stockholders lack reasonable commercial purposes, any gains recognized on such transfers might be subject to individual income tax in China at the standard rate of 20%.
 
It is unclear whether Company stockholders that acquired Yum China stock through the distribution or the Global Offering (discussed under “—Our History”) will be treated as acquiring Yum China stock in an open market purchase. If such acquisition of Yum China stock is not treated as acquired in an open market purchase, the listed transaction exception will not be available for transfers of such stock. We expect that transfers in open market transactions of our stock by corporate or other non-individual stockholders that have purchased our stock in open market transactions will not be taxable under the China indirect transfer rules due to the listed enterprise exception. Transfers, whether in the open market or otherwise, of our stock by corporate and other non-individual stockholders that acquired our stock in the distribution or the Global Offering or in non-open market transactions may be taxable under the China indirect transfer rules and our China subsidiaries may have filing obligations in respect of such transfers upon the request of relevant Chinese tax authorities. Transfers of our stock in non-open market transactions by corporate and other non-individual stockholders may be taxable under the China indirect transfer rules, whether or not such stock was acquired in open market transactions, and our China subsidiaries may have filing obligations in respect of such transfers upon the request of relevant China tax authorities. Corporate and other non-individual stockholders may be exempt from taxation under the Chinese indirect transfer rules with respect to transfers of our stock if they are tax resident in a country or region that has a tax treaty or arrangement with China that provides for a capital gains tax exemption and they qualify for that exemption.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). In December 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Act, which included a broad range of tax reforms, including, but not limited to, the establishment of a flat corporate income tax rate of 21%, the elimination or reduction of certain business deductions, and the imposition of tax on deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings. The Tax Act has impacted Yum China in two material aspects: (1) in general, all of the foreign-source dividends received by Yum China from its foreign subsidiaries will be exempted from taxation starting from the tax year beginning after December 31, 2017 and (2) Yum China recorded additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, including an estimated one-time transition tax on its deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and additional tax related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets. The Tax Act also requires a U.S. shareholder to be subject to tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries.
 
The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Services (the “IRS”) released the final transition tax regulations in the first quarter of 2019. We completed the evaluation of the impact on our transition tax computation based on the final regulations released in the first quarter of 2019 and recorded additional income tax expense for the transition tax accordingly.
 
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international regulation relating to taxation of our business.
