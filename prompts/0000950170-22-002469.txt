ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
 
Green Thumb Industries Inc. is a reporting issuer in the United States and Canada and the Company's Subordinate Voting Shares are listed for trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange (“CSE”) under the symbol “GTII.” The Company’s Subordinate Voting Shares (as hereinafter defined) are also traded in the United States on the OTCQX Best Market (the “OTCQX”) under the symbol “GTBIF.”
 
Originally founded in 2014, Green Thumb began operations in 2015 upon the award of a medical marijuana license for cultivation/processing and retail sale of cannabis in Illinois. The Company has since expanded its operational footprint to 15 U.S. markets, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia. Currently, Green Thumb owns, manufactures, and distributes a portfolio of cannabis consumer packaged goods brands including Beboe, Dogwalkers, Doctor Solomon’s, Good Green, incredibles and RYTHM, to third-party retail stores across the United States as well as to Green Thumb owned retail stores. The Company also owns and operates retail cannabis stores that include a rapidly growing national chain called Rise, as well as retail stores operating under other names, many of which are in the process of being rebranded to Rise. Our retail stores sell a combination of our products and third-party products (which we refer to as our Retail business).
 
The Company, through its subsidiaries, owns state-licensed medical and/or adult use marijuana businesses in California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia. We also license our intellectual property and certain brands to licensees in Colorado. The following organizational chart describes the organizational structure of the Company as of December 31, 2021. See Exhibit 21.1 to this document for a list of subsidiaries of the Company. All lines represent 100% ownership of outstanding securities of the applicable subsidiary unless otherwise noted in Exhibit 21.1. In part, the complexity of our organization structure is due to state licensing requirements that mandate that we maintain the corporate identity of our operating license holders.
 

The registered office of the Company is located at 250 Howe Street, 20th Floor, Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 3R8. The head office is located at 325 W. Huron Street, Suite 700, Chicago, Illinois 60654.
 

History of the Company
 
For information on the history of the Company and the development of the business prior to June 13, 2018, the day our Subordinate Voting Shares began trading on the CSE, see the information set forth under the headings “Business – Our History” and “Business – General Development of the Business” in Amendment No. 2 to our Registration Statement on Form S-1 that was filed with the SEC on February 2, 2021 with Registration No. 333-248213.

Financing Activities
 
On February 8, 2021, the SEC declared effective the Company’s Registration Statement No. 333-248213 on Form S-1 filed on February 2, 2021. Shortly thereafter, the Company received an offer from a single institutional investor to purchase 3,122,074 of the Subordinate Voting Shares registered on the Form S-1 at a price of $32.03 per share for a total of $100,000 thousand. The transaction closed on February 9, 2021. On February 23, 2021, the Company accepted additional offers to purchase a total of 1,571,917 Subordinate Voting Shares at a price of $35.50 per share, for a total of $55,803 thousand. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of securities for general corporate purposes, which included capital expenditures, working capital and general and administrative expenses. The Company also used a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses or products that are complimentary to the Company's own businesses and products.
 
On April 30, 2021, the Company closed a $216,734 thousand Senior Secured non-brokered private placement financing through the issuance of senior secured notes (the “April 30, 2021 Notes”) pursuant to the Second Amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement (the "Note Purchase Agreement"). The Company used the proceeds to retire the Company’s existing $105,466 thousand, senior secured notes due May 22, 2023 (the "May 22, 2019 Notes") and the remaining proceeds for general working capital purposes as well as various growth initiatives. The Notes have a maturity date of April 30, 2024 and bear interest from the date of issue of 7.00% per annum, payable quarterly, with an option, at the discretion of the Company, to extend for an additional 12 months. The financing permitted the Company to borrow an additional $33,266 thousand over the next twelve months. The purchasers of the April 30, 2021 Notes also received 1,459,044 warrants (the “Warrants”) which allow the holder to purchase one Subordinate Voting Share at an exercise price of $32.68 per share, for a period of 60 months from the date of issue.
 
On October 15, 2021, the Company amended its existing Notes Purchase Agreement with the Second Amended Notes Purchase Agreement dated April 30, 2021, for the purposes of borrowing an additional $33,200 thousand, as permitted under the April 30, 2021 Notes Purchase Agreement (the "Amended Notes"). The additional borrowings have terms consistent with the April 30, 2021 Notes and increase the total amount borrowed to $249,934 thousand. The Company intends to use the additional proceeds for general working capital purposes as well as various growth initiatives. The purchasers of the Amended Notes received an additional 243,303 warrants which allow the holder to purchase one Subordinate Voting Share at an exercise price of $30.02 per share, for a period of 60 months from the date of issue.
 
On March 6, 2020, the Company closed a sale and lease back transaction to sell its Oglesby, Illinois cultivation and processing facility to an unrelated third party, Innovative Industrial Properties (“IIP”). Under a long-term agreement, the Company leased back the facility and continues to operate and manage it. The purchase price for the property was $9,000 thousand, excluding transaction costs. The Company made certain improvements to the property that have significantly enhance production capacity, for which IIP provided reimbursement of $41,000 thousand.
 
On January 31, 2020, the Company closed a sale and leaseback transaction to sell its Toledo, Ohio processing facility to IIP. Under a long-term agreement, the Company leased back the facility and continues to operate the space and manage it. The purchase price for the property was $2,900 thousand, excluding transaction costs. The Company made certain improvements to the property that have significantly enhance production capacity, for which IIP has provided reimbursement of $4,300 thousand.
 
On October 1, 2020, the Company and IIP agreed to amend the lease on the Toledo, Ohio processing facility. Under the amendment, IIP provided an additional $25,000 thousand in funding to be used for the construction of a cannabis cultivation facility at the property.

On November 12, 2019, the Company closed a sale and lease back transaction to sell its Danville, Pennsylvania cultivation and processing facility to IIP. Under a long-term agreement, the Company leased back the facility and continues to operate and manage it. The purchase price for the property was $20,300 thousand, excluding transaction costs. The Company made certain improvements to the property that have significantly enhanced production capacity, for which IIP provided reimbursement of $19,300 thousand.

    On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization categorized the coronavirus disease 2019 (together with its variants "COVID-19") a global pandemic. COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the U.S. and other countries across the world, and the duration and severity of its effects are currently unknown. The Company continues to implement and evaluate actions to strengthen its financial position and support the continuity of its business and operations.

During 2021, the Company’s revenue, gross profit and operating income were not negatively impacted by COVID-19 and the Company generally maintained the consistency of its operations. However, it remains uncertain of how the future spread of COVID-19 and applicable vaccine mandates, or public health measures may impact the Company’s business operations for reasons including the potential quarantine of Green Thumb employees or those of its supply chain partners.
 


Description of the Business

Overview of the Company
 
Established in 2014 and headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Green Thumb is promoting well-being through the power of cannabis through branded consumer packaged goods and people-first retail experiences, while being committed to community and sustainable profitable growth. As of December 31, 2021, Green Thumb has operations across 15 U.S. markets, employs over 3,700 people and serves hundreds of thousands of patients and customers annually.
    Green Thumb’s core business is manufacturing, distributing and marketing a portfolio of owned cannabis consumer packaged goods brands (which we refer to as our Consumer Packaged Goods business), including Beboe, Dogwalkers, Doctor Solomon’s, Good Green, incredibles and RYTHM. The Company distributes and markets these products to third-party licensed retail cannabis stores across the United States as well as to Green Thumb-owned retail stores (which we refer to as our Retail business).
    The Company’s Consumer Packaged Goods portfolio is primarily generated from plant material that Green Thumb grows and processes which we use to produce our consumer packaged goods in 17 owned and operated manufacturing facilities. This portfolio consists of stock keeping units (“SKUs”) across a range of cannabis product categories, including flower, pre-rolls, concentrates, vape, capsules, tinctures, edibles, topicals and other cannabis-related products (none of which product category are individually material to the Company). These Consumer Package Goods products are sold in retail locations throughout the 15 U.S. markets Green Thumb operates in including Green Thumb’s own Rise dispensaries.

Green Thumb owns and operates a national cannabis retail chain called Rise which provide relationship-centric retail experiences aimed to deliver a superior level of customer service through high-engagement consumer interaction, a consultative, transparent and education-forward selling approach and a consistently available assortment of cannabis products. In addition, we own stores under other names, primarily where we co-own the stores or naming is subject to licensing or similar restrictions. The income from Green Thumb’s retail stores is primarily from the sale of cannabis-related products, which includes the sale of Green Thumb produced products as well as those produced by third parties, with an immaterial (under 10%) portion of this income resulting from the sale of other merchandise (such as t-shirts and accessories for cannabis use). The Rise dispensaries currently are located in ten of the states in which we operate. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 73 open and operating retail locations. The Company’s new store opening plans will remain fluid depending on market conditions, obtaining local licensing, construction and other permissions and subject to the Company’s capital allocation plans and the evolving situation with respect to the COVID-19.
 
Financial Highlights and Revenue Streams
 
The Company has consolidated financial statements across its operating businesses with revenue from the manufacture, sale and distribution of branded cannabis products to third-party licensed retail customers as well as the sale of finished products to consumers in its retail stores.
 
The percentage of total revenue contributed by operations of the Consumer Package Goods segment was 31%, 29% and 36% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively. The percentage of total revenue contributed by the Retail segment was 69%, 71% and 64% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Item 7—“Management Discussion and Analysis” for details on key financial highlights.

As of the year ended December 31, 2021, Green Thumb has operating revenue in 15 markets (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia).
 


Geographic Information
 
Green Thumb operates in 15 U.S. states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia.
 


Product Research, Design and Development
 
The Company’s branded products portfolio includes SKUs across a range of product categories, including flower, pre-rolls, concentrates, vape, tinctures, edibles, topicals and other cannabis-related products.
 Green Thumb engages in research and development activities focused on developing new extracted or infused cannabis consumer packaged products.
 
Manufacturing
    Our branded products are produced in manufacturing facilities across 15 U.S. states in which the primary activity is the cultivation, processing and manufacture of cannabis consumer packaged goods. The majority of our finished goods production is manufactured by our owned production facilities. However, we also have entered into manufacturing agreements with third parties, primarily for our cannabidiol (“CBD”) business lines, none of which account for more than 1% of finished goods production.

We aim to maintain strict brand and quality assurance standards and have implemented standard operating procedures across all production facilities to ensure continuity of product and consistent consumer experience across all operating markets.

Sources and Availability of Materials
 
Almost all of the raw material input, except packaging materials, used by the Company to produce finished cannabis consumer packaged goods are cultivated or processed internally for further use in the manufacturing process.
 
Significant Customers
 
Customers of our consumer packaged goods business include legal state-licensed cannabis dispensaries within each U.S. state in which we operate, as well as national retail channels, including department stores and specialty boutiques. The majority of our branded consumer packaged goods are distributed to unrelated third-party licensed retail cannabis stores. Green Thumb is not dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of any one or more of which would not have a material adverse effect on the business. No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.
Merchandise
 
To meet the array of unique customer needs, we offer a variety of cannabis products at each of our Rise and other stores, totaling thousands of SKUs in managed inventory, comprehensive of product categories including flower, concentrates, topicals (bath and beauty products) and edibles (confection, beverages, snacks).
 
We leverage our owned retail channel, Rise and our other stores to distribute our branded product portfolio, such as Beboe, Dogwalkers, Doctor Solomon’s, Good Green, incredibles, and RYTHM, among others.

All products sold have passed state-mandated third-party testing as required by applicable law to help assure that they do not contain impermissible levels of toxins, microbials and other harmful substances, are inventoried in comprehensive seed-to-sale tracking software to minimize product slippage and deviated inventory and meet the Company’s vendor requirements for quality assurance and reliability.
 
Omnichannel Distribution
 
Products sold at our Rise and other stores are delivered directly to our stores primarily by our manufacturing and distribution vendor partners.
 
Our primary retail presence is traditional brick and mortar. However, as regulations allow, we expect to continue to expand our e-commerce, in-store guest pick-up and direct to consumer delivery capabilities as part of our commitment to providing a consistent retail brand experience no matter where the consumer might be.
Intellectual Property – Patents and Trademarks

We believe that brand protection is critical to our business strategy. We regularly seek to protect our intellectual property rights in connection with our operating names (e.g., Green Thumb and Rise), our consumer packaged goods (e.g., Dogwalkers and RYTHM) and certain patentable goods and services. The U.S. trademark statute, The Lanham Act, allows for the protection of trademarks and service marks on products and services used, or intended for use, lawfully. Because cannabis-related products and services remain illegal at the federal level under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811), we are not able to protect all our intellectual property at the federal level; therefore, we currently seek trademark protections at the state level where commercially feasible. Nonetheless, our success depends upon other areas of our business such as product development and design, production and marketing and not exclusively upon trademarks, patents and trade secrets.
 
From the time the Company became licensed to cultivate cannabis, we have developed proprietary cultivation techniques. The Company has also developed certain proprietary intellectual property for operating butane extraction, carbon dioxide extraction and ethanol extraction machinery, including production best practices, procedures and methods. This requires specialized skills in cultivation, extraction and refining.
 
The Company relies on non-disclosure/confidentiality agreements to protect its intellectual property rights. To the extent the Company describes or discloses its proprietary cultivation or extraction techniques in its applications for cultivation or processing licenses, the Company redacts or requests redaction of such information prior to public disclosure.

The Company has sought U.S. patent protection for certain of its Doctor Solomon’s products, namely a utility patent for compositions and methods for treating skin and neuropathic conditions and disorders. Where commercially reasonable, we will seek further U.S. patent protection on other eligible products and services. The Company owns several website domains, including www.gtigrows.com, numerous social media accounts across all major platforms and various phone and web application platforms.
 
The Company has successfully registered over 70 trademarks across the United States and internationally and has additional trademark applications pending. The Company anticipates feedback on outstanding submitted applications on a rolling basis. As such, the Company will continue to rely on common law protection for these brands during the trademark registration process. Moreover, the Company will proactively seek intellectual property protection for brand expansions in current markets as well as any new market expansion. For additional details on the risks associated with the lack of trademark protection, see Item 1A—“Risk Factors” with respect to intellectual property.
 
For incredibles branded cannabis products, the Company has entered into licensing contracts with third parties that hold licenses to engage in the sale of cannabis in the state of Colorado, where the Company does not have licenses to operate cultivation and processing facilities. Such third parties directly engage in or arrange for the sourcing, manufacturing, laboratory testing, quality assurance, storage, marketing, sales, distribution and delivery of products containing cannabis and remit licensing fees to the Company.



Joint Ventures
 
We utilize joint ventures when necessary to comply with state regulatory requirements in certain states. Partnering with one or more non-affiliated third parties provides the Company with the opportunity to mitigate certain operational and financial risks while ensuring continued compliance with the applicable regulatory guidelines. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has joint ventures for the operation of (i) two dispensaries in Illinois of which the Company holds a 50% interest, (ii) a dispensary in Westport, Connecticut of which the Company holds a 46% interest, and (iii) a Massachusetts operator of which the Company holds less than a 10% interest.
Working Capital
 
Effective inventory management is critical to the Company’s ongoing success and the Company uses a variety of demand and supply forecasting, planning and replenishment techniques. The Company strives to maintain sufficient levels of inventory of core product categories, maintain positive vendor and customer relationships and carefully plan to minimize markdowns and inventory write-offs.

For additional details on liquidity and Capital Resources, see Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
Number of Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, Green Thumb employs over 3,700 team members nationwide including corporate, retail and manufacturing, both full- and part-time employees, and including but not limited to: finance and accounting, legal and compliance, supply chain and operations, sales and marketing, commercial and cannabis agriculture, chemists, customer service, construction and project management, real estate and human resources. We offer a comprehensive package of company-sponsored benefits to our team. Eligibility depends on the full-time or part-time status, location and other factors, and benefits include 401(k), medical and dental plans, disability insurance, employee assistance programs and life insurance. Additionally, we believe in aligned incentives and utilize employee stock and incentive plans for a competitive total rewards program.

Our employees are split across the Company as follows:
 

Corporate: | 311 
Retail: | 2,056
Manufacturing: | 1,363
Total | 3,730

Environmental Compliance
 
Expenditures for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are consistent from year to year and are not material to the Company’s financials. The Company is compliant with all applicable regulations and does not use materials that would pose any known risk under normal conditions.

Competitive Conditions and the Company’s Position in the Industry

Competition
 
The markets in which the Company’s products are distributed and its retail stores are operated are highly competitive markets. The Company’s operations exist in markets with relatively high barriers to entry given the licensed nature of the cannabis industry. The Company competes directly with cannabis producers and retailers within single-state operating markets, as well as those that operate across several U.S. markets. More broadly, Green Thumb views manufacturers of other consumer products, such as those in the pharmaceuticals, alcohol, tobacco, health and beauty and functional wellness industries, as potential competitors. Product quality, performance, new product innovation and development, packaging, customer experience and consumer price/value are important differentiating factors.
 


The Company faces intense competition from other companies that may have a longer operating history, a higher capitalization, additional financial resources, more manufacturing and marketing experience, greater access to public equity and debt markets and more experienced management than the Company. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The vast majority of both manufacturing and retail competitors in our markets consist of localized businesses (i.e. doing business in only a single state market). There are a few multi­state operators with whom the Company competes directly in several of the Company’s operating markets. Aside from this direct competition, out-of-state operators that are capitalized well enough to enter those markets through acquisitions are also part of the competitive landscape. Similarly, as the Company executes its national U.S. growth strategy, operators in our future state markets will inevitably become direct competitors.

Because of the early stage of the industry in which the Company operates, the Company faces additional competition from new entrants. If the number of consumers of medical and adult use cannabis in the states in which the Company operates its business increases, the demand for products will increase and the Company expects that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products. To remain competitive, the Company will require a continued high level of investment in research and development, marketing, sales and client support. The Company may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales and client support efforts on a competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of its operations.
 See Item 1A—“Risk Factors” with respect to competition.
 
Federal and State Regulation of Cannabis
 
Below is a discussion of the federal and state-level regulatory regimes in the jurisdictions where the Company is currently operating through its subsidiaries.
 
Federal illegality of Cannabis

The U.S. federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. Schedule I controlled substances are federally illegal and the manufacturing, sale and use of cannabis is a violation of federal law.
 
Due to the conflicting views between state legislatures and the federal government regarding cannabis, cannabis businesses are subject to inconsistent laws and regulations. The Obama Administration attempted to address the inconsistent treatment of cannabis under state and federal law in the Cole Memorandum that Deputy Attorney General James Cole sent to all U.S. Attorneys in August 2013, which outlined certain priorities for the Department of Justice relating to the prosecution of cannabis offenses. The Cole Memorandum noted that, in jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form and that have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with such laws and regulations was not a prosecution or enforcement priority for the Department of Justice. However, the Department of Justice did not provide (and has not provided since) specific guidelines for what regulatory and enforcement systems would be deemed sufficient under the Cole Memorandum.
 
On January 4, 2018, then U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a new memorandum which rescinded the Cole Memorandum. Despite its recission, as of December 21, 2021, federal prosecutors appear to continue to use the Cole Memorandum’s priorities as an enforcement guide. Merrick Garland, who became Attorney General on March 10, 2021, has indicated that he would deprioritize enforcement of low-level cannabis crimes such as possession, and during his congressional testimony in February 2021, Garland stated that the Justice Department would not pursue cases against Americans complying with laws of the states that have legalized and are regulating marijuana. President Joseph R. Biden, who assumed office in January 2021, stated a policy goal of federal cannabis decriminalization, but has not publicly supported the legalization of cannabis.

As an industry best practice, the Company continues to employ the following policies to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:

•Our operations and our subsidiaries’ operations are compliant with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough and other political/administrative divisions; to this end, we retain appropriately experienced legal counsel to help ensure compliance of such operations with all applicable licensing requirements; 
 

•The cannabis-related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained—for example, in states where only medical cannabis is permitted, the products are only sold to patients who hold the necessary documentation to permit the possession of the cannabis; in states where cannabis is permitted for adult use, the products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements; 
 
•Our operating subsidiaries must pass a range of requirements, adhere to strict business practice standards and be subject to strict regulatory oversight to ensure that no revenue is distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs or cartels; 
 
•We have implemented an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to help ensure that such compliance system is effective in tracking inventory and preventing diversion of cannabis or cannabis products, as well as employ strict customer identification protocols to prevent sales to minors; 
 
•Our state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs, and we are not engaged in any other illegal activity; and 
 
•We conduct reviews of products and product packaging to ensure that the products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving. 
 
There have been efforts at reforming federal cannabis law. As of December 21, 2021, there were more than a dozen proposed congressional bills addressing myriad issues regarding the cannabis industry, from banking and tax reform to full legalization. However, none have passed into law.

There does exists a legislative safeguard for the medical cannabis industry, appended to the federal budget bill. For each year since 2015, Congress has adopted a so-called “rider” provision to the Consolidated Appropriations Acts (formerly referred to as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment and currently referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment) to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal law against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. On December 3, 2021, the amendment was renewed through a pair of stopgap spending bills, with the most recent extension effective through February 18, 2022.

The sheer size of the cannabis industry, in addition to participation by state and local governments and investors, suggests that a large-scale federal enforcement operation would more than likely create unwanted political backlash for the Department of Justice and the current administration. Regardless, cannabis remains illegal at the federal level. The U.S. federal government has always reserved the right to enforce federal law over the sale and disbursement of medical or adult use cannabis, even if state law authorizes such sale and disbursement. There is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will remain in place or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the Controlled Substances Act with respect to cannabis, there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law criminalizing cannabis.

We will continue to monitor compliance on an ongoing basis in accordance with our compliance program and standard operating procedures. While our operations are in compliance with all applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements, such activities remain illegal under federal law. For the reasons described above and the risks further described in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” there are significant risks associated with our business. Readers of this Form are strongly encouraged to carefully read all of the risk factors contained in Item 1A—“Risk Factors.”



Federal Law and Ability to Access Public and Private Capital

Due to the present state of the laws and regulations governing financial institutions in the U.S., banks often refuse to provide services to businesses involved in the cannabis industry and U.S. multistate operators are currently not permitted to list securities on the U.S. exchanges. Consequently, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing from large U.S. financial institutions.
 
We have historically, and continue to have, access to equity and debt financing from non-public (i.e., private placement) markets and state-chartered financial institutions. Our executive team and Board have extensive relationships with sources of capital (such as funds and high net worth individuals).

In addition to our working capital, we continue to generate adequate cash to fund our operations from capital raising transactions. Our business plan continues to include aggressive growth, both in the form of additional acquisitions and through facility expansion and improvements. Accordingly, we expect to raise additional capital, both in the form of debt and new equity offerings, during the next few years.

However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or on terms that are acceptable.

Restricted Access to Banking and Other Financial Services

FinCEN issued the FinCEN Memorandum on February 14, 2014, which advised financial institutions providing banking services to cannabis businesses. These include burdensome due diligence expectations and reporting requirements. The FinCEN Memorandum outlines the pathways for financial institutions to bank state-sanctioned cannabis businesses in compliance with federal enforcement priorities. The FinCEN Memorandum echoed the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum and states that, in some circumstances, it is permissible for banks to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of federal money laundering laws. Under these guidelines, financial institutions must submit a Suspicious Activity Report in connection with all cannabis-related banking activities by any client of such financial institution, in accordance with federal money laundering laws.

However, the FinCEN Memorandum does not provide any safe harbors or legal defenses from examination or regulatory or criminal enforcement actions by the Department of Justice, FinCEN or other federal regulators for banks and other financial institutions and can be amended or revoked at any time. Thus, most banks and other financial institutions in the United States do not appear comfortable relying on this guidance to provide banking services to the cannabis industry. Banks and/or card networks may also refuse to process debit card payments and credit card companies generally refuse to process credit card payments for cannabis-related businesses. In addition, federal money laundering statutes and regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, discourage financial institutions from working with any organization that sells a controlled substance, regardless of whether the state in which it operates permits cannabis sales. The inability or limitation on our ability to open or maintain bank accounts, obtain other banking services and/or accept credit card and debit card payments may make it difficult for us to operate and conduct our business as planned or to operate efficiently.

On March 7, 2019, Democratic representative Ed Perlmutter of Colorado introduced the SAFE Banking Act, which would protect banks and their employees from punishment for providing services to cannabis businesses that are legal on a state level. The bill passed with strong bipartisan support in the House of Representatives on September 25, 2019. The House passed the SAFE Banking Act numerous times since then, most recently on February 4, 2022, as an amendment to the America COMPETES Act. Some industry observers are hopeful that the bill will be signed into law within the next year, which would allow financial institutions to provide services to marijuana related businesses without risk of violating federal money laundering statutes.

State Cannabis Law

State laws that permit and regulate the production, distribution and use of cannabis for adult use or medical purposes are in direct conflict with federal law. Although certain states and territories of the U.S. authorize medical and/or adult use cannabis production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia are criminal acts under the Controlled Substances Act. Although the Company’s activities are believed to be compliant with applicable state and local laws, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under U.S. federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding that may be brought against the Company.
 


As of December 31, 2021, 36 states, (and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands,) have legalized the cultivation and sale of cannabis for medical purposes. In 18 of those states, the sale and possession of cannabis is legal for both medical and adult use, and the District of Columbia has legalized adult use but not commercial sale. In November 2020, voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota voted by referendum to legalize cannabis for adult use, and voters in Mississippi and South Dakota voted to legalized cannabis for medical use. In February 2021, adult use cannabis became legal in New Jersey. Adult use cannabis was legalized in New York one month later. And in July 2021, Virginia became the first southern state to legalize cannabis for adult use.
 
Company’s Medical-Only Markets

All of the medical-only markets in which the Company does business (Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia) have written regulations that impose limitations on the number of cannabis business licenses that can be awarded by the state. In each of these markets, we have a proven track record of: (i) entering the market through state-granted awards based on the merit of our application and business plans; and/or (ii) expanding market reach through accretive mergers, acquisitions, and partnership ventures. Each medical use market that also allows adult use (including Illinois, California, Colorado, Massachusetts and Nevada) has regulations specifying which medical conditions qualify a patient for a license to purchase cannabis, and generally require the approval from a physician. A number of these states have passed laws allowing for adult-use sales, but those programs are not yet operational. Specifically, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Virginia have all legalized adult use cannabis, but none have launched their adult use programs. Connecticut and New Jersey are expected to launch their adult use programs during 2022. New York is expected to begin sales in late 2022 or 2023; and Virginia is not expected to begin sales until 2024.
Company’s Adult Use Markets

The Company has adult use operations in California, Illinois, Massachusetts and Nevada. The Company also has licensing and distribution contracts with third parties that hold licenses to engage in the sale of cannabis in Colorado for incredibles and Beboe branded cannabis products. Many of the adult use markets in which the Company operates in (California, Colorado, Massachusetts and Nevada) have fewer barriers to entry and more closely reflect free market dynamics typically seen in mature retail and manufacturing industries. The growth of these markets poses a risk of increased competition. However, management views the Company’s market share as less at risk than operators without a current operating footprint due to our established brand recognition and supply and distribution chains. Additionally, regulations in some adult use markets, such as Illinois, allowed us to quickly develop adult use market share in those states. Purchasers of adult use cannabis generally are subject to higher sales taxes than apply to purchasers who are authorized for medical purposes. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that some consumers who meet the criteria to apply for medical licenses make adult use purchases and avoid pursuing a state’s medical registration/qualification process.
Regulatory Environment in States Where We Operate
 
The risk of federal enforcement and other risks associated with the Company’s business are described in Item 1A—“Risk Factors.”
 
Regulation of the Cannabis Market at State and Local Level

Following the thesis that distributing brands at scale will win, we enter markets where we believe that we can profitably and sustainably operate and command significant market share, and thus maximize consumer and brand awareness. The regulatory frameworks installed by the states, which are similar to the limited and controlled issuance of gaming or alcohol distributorship licenses, provide macro-level indication of whether certain state markets will be sustainable and profitable.
 
Below is a summary overview of the regulatory and competitive frameworks in each of our operating markets. See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a state-by-state list of the licenses and permits held by us.
 
California
 
California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana through Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. This legalized the use, possession and cultivation of medical marijuana by patients with a physician recommendation for treatment of a variety of illnesses, including any for which marijuana provides relief. In 2003, Senate Bill 420 was signed into law establishing an optional identification card system for medical marijuana patients.
 


In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act(“MCRSA”). The MCRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for medical marijuana businesses in California. In November 2016, voters in California overwhelmingly passed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“AUMA”) creating an adult use marijuana program for adults 21 years of age or older. Senate Bill No. 94, known as Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”) in June 2017, amalgamating MCRSA and AUMA to provide a single set of regulations to govern a medical and adult use licensing. MAUCRSA went into effect on January 1, 2018.
 
The three agencies that regulate cannabis at the state level are: (a) the California Department of Food and Agriculture, via CalCannabis, which issues licenses to cannabis cultivators; (b) the California Department of Public Health, via the Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch, which issues licenses to cannabis manufacturers; and (c) the California Department of Consumer Affairs, via the Bureau of Cannabis Control, which issues licenses to cannabis distributors, testing laboratories, retailers and micro-businesses.
 
California License and Regulations

In order to legally operate a medical or adult use cannabis business in California, the operator must have both a local and state license. This requires license holders to operate in cities with cannabis licensing programs. Municipalities in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to cannabis operators or can choose to ban cannabis businesses outright.

There are three principal license categories in California: (1) cultivation, (2) processing and (3) retailer.
 
Cultivation licenses permit commercial cannabis cultivation activity involving the planting, growing, harvesting, drying, curing, grading or trimming of cannabis. Such licenses further permit the production, labeling and packaging of a limited number of non-manufactured cannabis products and permit the licensee to sell cannabis to certain licensed entities (both medical and adult use licensees) within the State of California for resale or manufacturing purposes.
 
Processing licenses authorize manufacturers to process marijuana biomass into certain value-added products with the use of volatile or non-volatile solvents, depending on the license type.
 
Retailer licenses permit the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to both medical patients and adult use customers. Only certified physicians may provide medicinal marijuana recommendations. An adult use retailer license permits the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to any adult 21 years of age or older.
 
In 2021, we opened our first California retail operation in Pasadena. We have also been granted a conditional license, permitting us to pursue a second retail location.
 
We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by California.
 
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses and conditional licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in California.
 
Colorado
 
On November 7, 2000, Colorado voters approved Amendment 20, which amended the state constitution to allow the use of marijuana in the state by approved patients with written medical consent. Conditions.

Amendment 64 passed on November 6, 2012, which amended the state constitution to establish a cannabis program in Colorado and permit the commercial cultivation, manufacture and sale of marijuana to adults 21 years of age or older. The commercial sale of marijuana for adult use to the general public began on January 1, 2014.
 
Colorado License and Regulations
 
In Colorado, cannabis businesses must comply with local licensing requirements in addition to state licensing requirements in order to operate. Colorado localities are allowed to limit or prohibit the operation of marijuana cultivation facilities, product manufacturing facilities or retail dispensary facilities.
 
There are three principal license categories in Colorado: (1) cultivation, (2) product manufacturer and (3) medical center/retail store. Each facility is authorized to engage only in the type of activity for which it is licensed.


We do not have any licenses in the State of Colorado. We have licensing and distribution contracts with third parties that hold licenses to engage in the sale of cannabis in Colorado for incredibles and Beboe branded cannabis products. Such third parties directly engage in or arrange for the sourcing, manufacturing, laboratory testing, quality assurance, storage, marketing, sales, distribution and delivery of products containing cannabis and remit licensing fees to us. See Item 1—“Intellectual Property Patents and Trademarks” for details on licenses with respect to operations in Colorado.
 
Regulations for the production and sale of marijuana in Colorado are published through the Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Department of Revenue.

Connecticut
 
Connecticut’s medical cannabis program was introduced in May 2012 when the General Assembly passed legislation PA 12-55 “An Act Concerning the Palliative Use of Marijuana,” providing for the use of marijuana in the state by approved patients with written consent from a physician or advanced practice nurse. On July 1, 2021, PA 21-1 went into effect, allowing for the purchase and use of cannabis by any adult over the age of 21. Adult use retail sales are not expected to begin until late 2022.
Connecticut Licenses and Regulations

The Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection has issued regulations regarding the Medical Marijuana Program in Connecticut.

There are two principal medical marijuana license categories in Connecticut: (1) cultivation/processing and (2) dispensary. We are licensed to operate one medical marijuana cultivation/processing facility and three medical marijuana dispensaries. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Connecticut. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Connecticut.

Medical marijuana cultivation/processing licenses permit us to operate a secure, indoor facility to cultivate and process medical marijuana and wholesale to dispensaries.

Medical marijuana dispensary facility licenses qualify a dispensary to purchase medical cannabis from licensed medical cannabis producers and to dispense cannabis to qualifying patients or primary caregivers that are registered under the Medical Marijuana Program in Connecticut. Dispensaries must have a pharmacist on staff.

We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by Connecticut.
 
See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Connecticut.
 
Florida
 
In 2016, the Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization Initiative was introduced by citizen referendum and passed on November 8. This language, known as “Amendment 2,” amended the state constitution and mandated an expansion of the state’s medical cannabis program, which was previously limited to patients suffering from a diagnosed terminal condition.
 
Amendment 2, and the resulting expansion of qualifying medical conditions, became effective on January 3, 2017. On June 9, 2017, the Florida House of Representatives and Florida Senate passed respective legislation to implement the expanded program, which officially became law on June 23, 2017.
 
Florida Licenses and Regulations

There is one principal license category in Florida: the vertically-integrated Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers license. We are licensed to operate one medical cannabis cultivation/processing facility and medical cannabis dispensaries. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Florida. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Florida, meaning that the cultivation/processing facility is licensed and each of the medical cannabis dispensaries is individually licensed.
 
Licenses are issued by the Florida Department of Heath, Office of Medical Marijuana Use. License holders can only own one license. Currently, the dispensaries can be in any geographic location within the state, provided that the local municipality’s zoning regulations authorize such a use, the proposed site is zoned for a pharmacy and the site is not within 500 feet of a church or school.


As our operations in Florida are vertically-integrated, we are able to cultivate, harvest, process and sell/dispense/deliver its own medical cannabis products. Under the terms of our Florida license, we are permitted to sell medical cannabis only to qualified medical patients that are registered with the State. Only certified physicians who have successfully completed a medical cannabis educational program can register patients on the Florida Office of Compassionate Use Registry.

We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by Florida.
 
See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Florida.
 
Illinois
 
In 2013, the Illinois General Assembly passed the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2014, allowing the use of marijuana in the state by approved patients with written medical consent. In June 2019, the Governor signed legislation legalizing cannabis for adult use. The Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, legalizing and regulating cannabis for recreational use, went into effect on June 25, 2019, and adult use sales of cannabis began in the state on January 1, 2020. The adult use program allowed existing medical cannabis license holders to apply for Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organization licenses to be able to sell adult use product at existing medical cannabis dispensaries (known as “co-located” or “same site” dispensaries) beginning on January 1, 2020, and to have the privilege of opening a secondary adult use only retail site for every medical cannabis dispensary location the Dispensing Organization already had in its portfolio. The Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act also authorized issuance of an additional 185 Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization licenses in 2021 but to date the awarding of those licenses has been stayed by court order. As of December 31, 2021, the awarding of new, smaller-scale cultivation licenses was also delayed by court order.
Illinois Licenses and Regulations
 
Illinois licenses four types of cannabis businesses within the state: (1) cultivation (includes processing); (2) infusing; (3) transportation; and (4) dispensary. Dispensaries are regulated by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation; the remainder are regulated by the Department of Agriculture. We are licensed to grow and process cannabis for medical and adult use sales at our two cultivation facilities. Dispensaries require separate licenses for adult use sales and medical sales. The dispensaries with “secondary” licenses by law serve only adult use customers, not medical patients.
 
The cultivation/processing licenses permit us to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture/process into edible marijuana products and/or marijuana-infused products, have tested, supply and sell marijuana and related supplies to marijuana dispensaries.
 
The retail dispensary licenses permit us to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation/processing facilities, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we have ten operating dispensaries in Illinois which is the statutory cap, operating under 15 licenses. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Illinois. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Illinois.
 
We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by Illinois.
 
See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued us with respect to our operations in Illinois.
 
Maryland
 
In 2012, a state law was enacted in Maryland to establish a state-regulated medical marijuana program. Legislation was signed in May 2013 and the program became operational on December 1, 2017. The Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission regulates the state program, which allows the use of marijuana in the state by approved patients with written medical consent.
Maryland Licenses and Regulations
 
There are three principal license categories in Maryland: (1) cultivation, (2) processing and (3) dispensary. We own one cultivation license, one processing license and three retail dispensaries. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Maryland. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at the Company facilities in Maryland. We also have a contract to manage another dispensary and a call option to acquire 100% of the equity interests in that dispensary in 2022.


The medical cultivation licenses permit us to acquire, possess, cultivate, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries, facilities for the production of medical marijuana products and/or medical marijuana-infused products or other medical marijuana cultivation facilities.
 
The medical processing license permits us to acquire, possess, manufacture, deliver, transfer, transport, supply, or sell marijuana products or marijuana infused products to other medical marijuana production facilities or medical marijuana dispensaries.
 
The retail dispensary licenses permit us to purchase marijuana from cultivation facilities, marijuana and marijuana products from product manufacturing facilities and marijuana from other medical marijuana dispensaries, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products.
 
We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by Maryland.
 
See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Maryland.
 
Massachusetts
 
Massachusetts legalized medical marijuana when voters passed a ballot initiative in 2012. The law took effect on January 1, 2023. Adult use marijuana became legal in Massachusetts as of December 15, 2016, following a ballot initiative in November 2016. In September 2017, the Cannabis Control Commission was established to regulate medical and adult use of marijuana in the state.
Massachusetts Licenses and Regulations
 
On the medical side, there is one principal license category in Massachusetts: a vertically-integrated Medical Marijuana Treatment Center (“MTC”) license. WMTCs grow, process and dispense their own marijuana. On the adult use side, there are many license categories, but the two principal ones are Marijuana Cultivator and Marijuana Establishment (dispensary).
 
The Cannabis Control Commission, a regulatory body created in 2018, oversees the medical and adult use programs, including licensing of cultivation, processing and dispensary facilities. Licensed medical dispensaries are given priority status in adult use licensing.

We have had an MTC in Massachusetts since 2018, with a cultivation facility in Holyoke and a medical/adult use dispensary in Amherst. With the acquisition of MTC Liberty Compassion, Inc. in 2021, we are licensed to operate two medical MTCs, including two cultivation/processing facilities and three retail dispensaries. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Massachusetts. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Massachusetts. On the adult use side, we acquired GreenStar in 2021, which operates three dispensaries, bringing our adult-use operations in Massachusetts to one cultivation center and four dispensaries.
 
We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by Massachusetts.
 
See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Massachusetts.
 
Minnesota
 
In 2014, Minnesota created a medical marijuana program for patients with qualifying medical conditions upon physician, physician assistant or nurse practitioner recommendation. While it is one of the stricter medical cannabis programs in the country, the list of qualifying conditions expanded over the years, including the addition of chronic pain in 2020. And while the forms of cannabis products available for purchase are limited, regulators announced in 2021 that edibles and smokable flower would be added to the list of approved products in 2022.
Minnesota License and Regulations
 
There is one category of licensure in Minnesota: medical cannabis manufacturer, which can grow, process and dispense medical cannabis.

A medical cannabis manufacturer is an entity registered with the Commissioner of Health that can cultivate, acquire, manufacturer, possess, prepare, transfer, transport, supply, and dispense medical cannabis.


The main regulatory body for marijuana is the Minnesota Department of Health, Office of Medical Cannabis.
 
In December 2021, we acquired LeafLine Industries, one of only two licensed medical cannabis manufacturer licenses in Minnesota, which came with a cultivation facility, five operating dispensaries and the right to open three additional dispensaries.

We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by Minnesota.
 
See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Minnesota.

Nevada
 
Nevada became a medical marijuana state in 2001. In 2013, the Nevada legislature passed SB374, providing for state licensing of medical marijuana establishments. On November 8, 2016, Nevada voters passed NRS 435D by ballot initiative allowing for the sale of marijuana for adult use starting on July 1, 2017. On June 12, 2019, the laws were revised, creating the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board to oversee administration of the program. The new laws also provided that each marijuana establishment must obtain a license from its local jurisdiction as well as the state.
Nevada Licenses and Regulations

There are three principal license categories in Nevada: (1) cultivation, (2) processing and (3) dispensary. We are licensed to operate two medical and adult use cultivation facilities, three medical and adult use processing facilities, five medical dispensary licenses and up to 13 adult use retail locations. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Nevada. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Nevada.
 
The cultivation licenses permit us to acquire, possess, cultivate, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to marijuana dispensaries, facilities for the production of edible marijuana products and/or marijuana-infused products or other marijuana cultivation facilities.
 
The processing license permits us to acquire, possess, manufacture, deliver, transfer, transport, supply or sell edible marijuana products or marijuana infused products to other marijuana production facilities or marijuana dispensaries.
 
The retail dispensary licenses permit us to purchase marijuana from cultivation facilities, marijuana and marijuana products from product manufacturing facilities and marijuana from other retail stores, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products.
 
We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by Nevada.
 
See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Nevada.
 
New Jersey
 
On January 18, 2010, the governor of New Jersey signed into law S.119, the Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act, permitting the use of medical cannabis with physician approval. The Compassionate Use of Medical Marijuana Act mandates that cannabis must be acquired through Alternative Treatment Centers licensed by the State. New Jersey’s adult use cannabis law went into effect in 2021, and the state began accepting applications for adult use licenses at the end of the year.

A single Alternative Treatment Centers license allows for the cultivation, processing and dispensing of medical marijuana products. Originally, each Alternative Treatment Centers was permitted to open one dispensary. With the Executive Order 6 Report, each Alternative Treatment Center can now open two additional satellite dispensaries within their New Jersey Department of Health-designated region for a total of three dispensaries each, as well as satellite production facilities, subject to regulatory approval.
 
On July 2, 2019, Governor Phil Murphy signed the Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act into law, which amended the Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act. Previously, New Jersey law only permitted applicants to apply for vertically-integrated licenses. Under the Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act, the permit process includes three different permit types. The new permit types are medical cannabis cultivator, dispensary and manufacturer permits, which are to be applied for individually. The vertically-integrated Alternative Treatment Centers will continue to be able to cultivate, manufacture and dispense medical cannabis.


After voters approved a ballot measure in November 2019, Governor Phil Murphy signed three bills into law in 2021 that establish an adult use program in New Jersey for adults who are at least 21 years old. New Jersey adult use sales are expected to begin during 2022.
 
New Jersey Licenses and Regulations

The New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission is responsible for regulating cannabis in New Jersey.
 
We are licensed to operate one medical cultivation and processing facility and three retail medical cannabis dispensaries in the state of New Jersey. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of New Jersey. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in New Jersey. Our medical cannabis licenses will allow us to participate in the adult use program once that program is operational, provided we notify the CRC of our intent, prove that we have adequate supply to meet the reasonably anticipated needs of medical cannabis patients, and receive approval from the municipalities where we are located.
 
We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by New Jersey.
 
See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in New Jersey.
 
New York

In July 2014, the New York Legislature and Governor enacted the Compassionate Care Act to provide a comprehensive, safe and effective medical marijuana program. The Compassionate Care Act provides access to the program for those who suffer from qualifying conditions and have a physician's recommendation. The program allows ten Registered Organizations to hold vertically-integrated licenses and service qualified patients and caregivers. Each Registered Organization has one cultivation/processing license and four dispensary licenses.

Only registered pharmacists can dispense medical marijuana to approved patients and caregivers. New York legislators legalized adult use cannabis in 2021, and the newly formed New York Office of Cannabis Management is promulgating rules and regulations. Adult use sales are not expected to begin until the end of 2022 or 2023.
 
New York Licenses and Regulations

The Office of Cannabis Management is the regulatory agency that oversees the medical marijuana program in New York. There is currently one principal license category in New York: vertically integrated license. The state also allows license holders to wholesale manufactured products to one another. We are licensed to operate one medical marijuana cultivation/manufacturing facility and four medical marijuana dispensaries. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of New York. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in New York.

We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by New York.
 
See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in New York.

Ohio
 
House Bill 523, effective on September 8, 2016, legalized medical marijuana in Ohio. The Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program allows people with certain medical conditions, upon the recommendation of an Ohio-licensed physician certified by the State Medical Board, to purchase and use medical marijuana. In November 2018, the state issued 12 ‘Level I’ cultivation licenses, which permit up to 25,000 square feet of canopy, and 12 ‘Level II’ cultivation licenses, which permit up to 3,000 square feet of canopy. In June 2018, the state issued 56 dispensary licenses. Subsequently, additional licenses have been granted.

Under the program rules, the Board will consider, on at least a biennial basis, whether enough medical marijuana dispensaries exist, considering the state population, the number of patients seeking to use medical marijuana and the geographic distribution of dispensary sites. More licenses may be issued based on those findings.
 


Ohio License and Regulations
 
There are three principal license categories in Ohio: (1) cultivation, (2) processing and (3) dispensary. We are licensed to operate one medical marijuana cultivation facility, one medical marijuana processing facility and up to five retail medical marijuana dispensaries in the state of Ohio. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Ohio. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Ohio.
 
The three following state government agencies are responsible for the operation of Ohio’s Medical Marijuana Control Program: (1) the Ohio Department of Commerce oversees medical marijuana cultivators, processors and testing laboratories; (2) the State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy oversees medical marijuana retail dispensaries, the registration of medical marijuana patients and caregivers, the approval of new forms of medical marijuana and coordinating the Medical Marijuana Advisory Committee; and (3) the State Medical Board of Ohio certifies physicians to recommend medical marijuana and may add to the list of qualifying conditions for which medical marijuana can be recommended.
 
The medical cultivation licenses permit us to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture/process into medical marijuana products, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries. The medical processor license permits us to manufacture and produce medical marijuana products.
 
The dispensary licenses will permit us to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation and/or processing facilities, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products to registered patients.

See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Ohio.
 
Pennsylvania
 
The Pennsylvania medical marijuana program was signed into law on April 17, 2016 under Act 16 and provided access to state residents with qualifying conditions. The state originally awarded only 12 licenses to cultivate/process and 27 licenses to operate retail dispensaries (which entitled holders to up to three medical dispensary locations per retail license). Subsequently, additional licenses have been granted.
Pennsylvania Licenses and Regulations

There are two principal license categories in Pennsylvania: (1) cultivation/processing and (2) dispensary. Our subsidiary GTI Pennsylvania, LLC is licensed to operate a medical cultivation/processing facility and is also licensed to operate medical retail locations. Our subsidiary KW Ventures Holdings, LLC is also licensed to operate medical retail locations. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Pennsylvania.
 
All cultivation/processing establishments and dispensaries must register with the Pennsylvania Department of Health.

Under applicable laws, the licenses permit the license holder to cultivate, manufacture, process, package, sell and purchase medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the licenses, which are issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health under the provisions of Medical Marijuana Act and Pennsylvania regulations.

The medical cultivation/processing licenses permit us to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture/process into medical marijuana products and/or medical marijuana-infused products, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries.
 
The retail dispensary licenses permit the Company to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation/processing facilities, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products.
 
We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by Pennsylvania.
 
See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Pennsylvania.
 
Rhode Island
 
Rhode Island legalized medical marijuana in 2006. Under this law, Rhode Island offers medical marijuana registration cards for patients with qualifying conditions and physician approval.


Rhode Island Licensure and Regulations
 
There are two categories of licensure in Rhode Island: compassion center (which can cultivate) and cultivator. As of December 31, 2021, there are three operating compassion centers in the state, and five more received approval to operate in 2021.
 
A compassion center is licensed by Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation, Office of Cannabis Regulation, to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture, deliver, transfer, transport, supply, or dispense medical marijuana, or related supplies and educational materials, to registered qualifying patients and their registered primary caregivers or authorized purchasers, or out-of-state patient cardholders or other marijuana establishment licensee.
 
In 2021, we acquired Mobley Pain Management and Wellness Center, LLC and Canwell Processing, LLC, which both held management agreements with Summit Medical Compassion Center, Inc., a non-profit corporation with cultivation and retail operations. Summit operates one of the three currently operating (as of December 31, 2021) dispensaries in the state.

We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by Rhode Island.
 
See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Rhode Island.
 Virginia
 
In 2017, Virginia passed a law that allowed patients suffering from intractable epilepsy access to cannabidiol (“CBD”) or THC-A oil. In 2018, this law was significantly expanded, which allowed any medical condition to qualify with state-certified physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant recommendation. The next year, the law was amended to allow for higher potency THC. In February 2021, cannabis was legalized for adult use. Adult-use retail sales will not begin until 2024.
Virginia License and Regulations
 
There are currently two principal license categories in Virginia: (1) pharmaceutical processing and (2) dispensing. The primary regulatory body for cannabis is the Virginia Department of Health Professions: Board of Pharmacy. A pharmaceutical processor must obtain a permit from the Board of Pharmacy. A pharmaceutical processor can cultivate cannabis plants intended only for the production of cannabis oil, botanical cannabis, and usable cannabis, produces cannabis products, and dispenses cannabis products to a registered patient, his registered agent, or, if such patient is a minor or an incapacitated adult.

A cannabis dispensing facility means a facility that has obtained a permit from the Board of Pharmacy. A cannabis dispensing facility is owned, at least in part, by a pharmaceutical processor; and can dispense cannabis products produced by a pharmaceutical processor to a registered patient, his registered agent, or, if such patient is a minor or an incapacitated adult.
 
In 2021, we acquired a pharmaceutical processor and one operating dispensary. We opened one additional dispensary in August 2021 two additional dispensaries in February 2022 and have the right to open two more dispensaries pending regulatory approval.

We follow all regulatory requirements regarding the reporting of inventory movement and sale, as well as all other data reporting and record retention requirements mandated by Virginia.
 
See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Virginia.
 


State License Renewal Requirements
 
For each of our provisional and operational licenses, the states impose strict license renewal requirements that vary state by state. We generally must complete the renewal application process within a prescribed period of time prior to the expiration date and pay an application fee. The state licensing body can deny or revoke licenses and renewals for a variety of reasons, including (a) submission of materially inaccurate, incomplete or fraudulent information, (b) failure of the company or any of its directors or officers to comply, or have a history of non-compliance, with any applicable law or regulation, including laws relating to minimum age of customers, safety and non-diversion of cannabis or cannabis products, taxes, child support, workers compensation and insurance coverage, or failure to otherwise remain in good standing (c) failure to submit or implement a plan of correction for any identified violation, (d) attempting to assign registration to another entity without state approval, (e) insufficient financial resources, (f) committing, permitting, aiding or abetting of any illegal practices in the operation of a facility, (g) failure to cooperate or give information to relevant law enforcement related to any matter arising out of conduct at a licensed facility and (h) lack of responsible operations, as evidenced by negligence, disorderly or unsanitary facilities or permitting a person to use a registration card belonging to another person. Certain jurisdictions also require licensees to attend a public hearing or forum in connection with their license renewal application.
Newly Established Legal Regime
 
Our business activities rely on newly established and/or developing laws and regulations in the states in which we operate. These laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and subject to change with minimal notice. Regulatory changes may adversely affect our profitability or cause us to cease operations entirely. The cannabis industry may come under further scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration, the SEC, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Advisory and other regulatory authorities that supervise or regulate the production, distribution, sale and use of cannabis for medical and nonmedical purposes in the United States. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed. The regulatory uncertainty surrounding the industry may adversely affect our business and operations, including without limitation, the costs to remain compliant with applicable laws and the impairment of our business or the ability to raise additional capital.
