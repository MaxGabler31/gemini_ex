 Item 1. Business.
Overview
 CarGurus, Inc. is a multinational, online automotive platform for buying and selling vehicles that is building upon its industry-leading listings marketplace with both digital retail solutions and the CarOffer online wholesale platform. The CarGurus marketplace gives consumers the confidence to purchase or sell a vehicle either online or in-person, and it gives dealerships the power to accurately price, effectively market, instantly acquire and quickly sell vehicles, all with a nationwide reach. CarGurus uses proprietary technology, search algorithms and data analytics to bring trust, transparency and competitive pricing to the automotive shopping experience. In addition to the United States, we operate online marketplaces under the CarGurus brand in Canada and the United Kingdom. In the United States and United Kingdom, we also operate the Autolist and PistonHeads online marketplaces, respectively, as independent brands.
CarGurus was founded upon the premise of bringing trust and transparency to the car shopping experience. Our online marketplace platform provides ease of access to prices of vehicles and dealer ratings imperative to a consumer’s vehicle purchase. Providing car-shoppers with the tools and knowledge for their experience has enabled us to garner a large, engaged user base with whom our dealers can transact. Our ready-to-shop audience of 31.6 million average monthly visitors in the U.S. has attracted 23,860 paying dealers to list inventory on our U.S. online marketplace. Over time we identified that we could continue to be a valued partner to consumers in their car-shopping journey while at the same time innovating to further our partnership with our dealer community. We have since introduced products that expand a dealer’s geographic footprint, enable digital retail capabilities that provide consumers with a self-selected journey, and offer new sources of acquiring inventory from our expanded network. This expanded suite of offerings can help increase our dealers’ return on investment, or ROI, adding even more scale to our marketplace network. While we maintain our founding principles of trust and transparency, we are evolving to be a transaction-enabled marketplace where consumers can shop, buy, seek financing, and sell their cars and dealers can source, market, and sell their vehicles. We believe this combination of differentiated offerings will transform the end-to-end car shopping journey for both consumers and dealers.
 Consumers' CarGurus Journey
Shop: A car purchase is a milestone in a consumer’s life – whether it is the first set of keys or parting from a memory-filled vehicle. However, shopping for a car can be frustrating instead of empowering. Enter CarGurus, where we provide trust and transparency to the process for consumers. As the consumer moves to purchase a vehicle, we aggregate vehicle inventory from dealers and apply our proprietary analysis to generate a Deal Rating as one of: Great Deal, Good Deal, Fair Deal, High Priced, or Overpriced. Deal Rating illustrates how competitive a listing is compared to similar cars sold in the same region in recent history. We determine Deal Rating principally on the basis of both our proprietary Instant Market Value, or IMV, algorithm, which determines the market value of a used vehicle in a local market, and Dealer Rating, a measure of a dealer’s reputation as determined by reviews of that dealer from our user community. As the only major U.S. online automotive marketplace that defaults to sorting organic search results based on a used car’s Deal Rating, we enable consumers to find the most relevant car for their needs. For new cars, we help our users understand deal quality by providing price analysis and our Dealer Rating. We also provide our users information historically not widely available, such as Price History, Time on Site, and Vehicle History.
 Buy/Finance: Once a consumer has found a listing they intend to pursue, we provide an omni-channel approach to the purchase of a vehicle partially or completely online. Our digital retail products such as Area Boost and Finance in Advance provide the consumer a self-selected car-buying journey to tailor their experience to their specific needs. We believe this approach throughout the end-to-end consumer experience brings greater trust, transparency, and efficiency to a consumer’s entire car shopping experience, leading to highly-engaged, more confident and satisfied shoppers.
Sell: According to recent consumer research, almost 60% of car-buying shoppers will trade in or sell a vehicle during their car-shopping journey. Our acquisition of 51% interest in CarOffer, LLC, or CarOffer, in January 2021, with the ability to buy the remaining equity interest in the company over the next three years, enabled the launch of CarGurus Instant Max Cash Offer, or IMCO. IMCO provides the consumer with the ability to complete this part of the process entirely online through a trusted and transparent experience. Consumers who are trading-in or selling vehicles receive the most competitive offer sourced from in-network dealers. Consumers benefit from the volume of participating dealerships in the CarGurus/CarOffer network, as well as the CarOffer Buying Matrix’s 24-7 automated matching, which enables a hands-off approach to find the consumer the best deal at any time. Once the customer has accepted their offer, they can further customize their experience by arranging a location of their choice within participating states to have the vehicle picked-up and transported. With expansive dealer networks, consumers can have the confidence that they are truly finding the best deal for their vehicle instantly.
Dealers' CarGurus Journey
Source: As macroeconomic issues, including the global semiconductor chip shortage, impacted the automotive industry over the past year, obtaining vehicle inventory through in-person, time-consuming methods highlighted inefficiencies; as a result of which, inventory across dealer lots fell to historical lows during 2021. Made possible by the acquisition of CarOffer in 2021, we entered the digital wholesale space enabling dealers to acquire inventory in a convenient and efficient manner. CarOffer is an automated instant vehicle trade platform that is disrupting the traditional wholesale auction model with technology that enables dealers to bid, transact, inspect and transport vehicles seamlessly and efficiently. Any dealer, including those who are customers of the CarGurus site, can enroll on the CarOffer platform at no additional cost. CarOffer’s proprietary Buying Matrix technology allows dealers on the platform to buy and sell to other dealers using limit orders, saving dealers the time and expense of going to an auction to acquire vehicles via the traditional in-person physical auction model. Through inspections on every sale, dealers can be confident their purchase meets their expectations while they reap the benefits of focusing their resources and attention on other elements of their businesses. As CarOffer dealer enrollments continue to increase, we expect dealers will see a corresponding increase of inventory on the platform, further enabling liquidity, selection, and business efficiencies. Additionally, the CarOffer platform enabled us to launch IMCO across approximately 70% of the U.S., providing dealers access to a fresh source of trade-in inventory and ensuring liquidity amongst CarOffer’s platform. Similar to a dealer-to-dealer purchase, CarOffer handles inspections, transportation, titles, and payments in one bill of sale from the consumer. CarOffer’s platform provides a solution for a dealer looking to minimize reliance on in-person or online auctions to source their vehicle inventory while assuring they are paying a fair price, which has led to rapid growth and adoption within the dealer community.
Market: Dealers can list their inventory on CarGurus’ marketplace for free or with a subscription to one of our paid Listings packages. Non-paying dealers receive a limited number of anonymized email connections and access to a subset of tools on our Dealer Dashboard at no cost. A dealer with a paid subscription receives connections with consumers that are not anonymous and are made through a wider variety of methods, including phone calls, email, managed text and chat, links to the dealer’s website, and map directions to its dealerships. The primary objective of our traffic acquisition and site improvement efforts is to generate quality consumer leads to dealers. Leads are a subcategory of connections that we define as user inquiries via our marketplace to dealers by phone calls, email, or managed text and chat interactions. We define connections as interactions between consumers and dealers via our marketplace through phone calls, email, managed text and chat, and clicks to access the dealer’s website and map directions to the dealership. Dealers with our paid Listings packages are able to display their dealer name, address, and dealership information on their listings on our websites to gain brand recognition, which promotes walk-in traffic to the dealership. Paying dealers also have access to tools on the Dealer Dashboard as well as other product offerings such as Area Boost, which enables dealers to expand their geographic footprint to reach an increased consumer audience. Through our large ready-to-purchase consumer audience, our paying dealers ultimately have a consistent and compelling ROI through our variety of product offerings.
Sell: By presenting consumers with data such as our Deal Ratings, Price History, Time on Site, and Vehicle History, we believe our consumer audience is comprised of more informed, ready-to-purchase shoppers. By connecting dealers with such consumers, we believe we provide dealers with an efficient customer acquisition channel with the highest-intent shoppers providing the highest ROI. Further, as consumer needs evolve to customizing aspects of their vehicle purchase, we provide dealers, through a variety of digital offerings, the means to cater to consumers on a personalized level. Consumers can choose to complete their self-selected car-shopping journey with as little or as many of the digital offerings that we provide through our partnership with dealers, enabling a personalized experience that allows consumers to reach their personalized destination. We also provide paying dealers with full access to our Dealer Dashboard, including inventory pricing tools informed by real time market conditions, which helps them more effectively price, merchandise, and sell their cars. With the acquisition of CarOffer, we have also integrated insights regarding wholesale pricing among the dealer community. The ability to compare wholesale pricing with retail pricing ultimately allows dealers to price a car with more accuracy, winning loyal consumers with trust and transparency. These combined offerings allow dealers to efficiently drive their business to success from all aspects of sourcing and selling. Our success in our partnership with dealers is evidenced by the number of paying dealers – 23,860 paying dealers as of December 31, 2021 – in our U.S. marketplace.
CarGurus Value Proposition
 Our scaled online transaction-enabled marketplace model drives powerful network effects. The combination of digital retail, digital wholesale and listings creates powerful synergies for dealers. Dealers can acquire inventory through consumers and other dealers on both the CarOffer and CarGurus platforms. The industry-leading inventory selection offered on the CarGurus website from our U.S. dealers attracts a large and engaged consumer audience – 31.6 million average monthly U.S. unique users in 2021 – and connections – 60.0 million in the U.S. in 2021. The value of robust connections to this audience incentivizes dealers to purchase our paid Listings packages. Expanded vehicle listings from paying dealers and an increasing number of offers by dealers to purchase vehicles from consumers provides consumers with diverse dealer information and choice. Our industry-leading consumer audience drives value to consumers looking to trade-in or sell their vehicle as well as paying dealers on our platform looking to acquire and sell inventory. As we continue to innovate and progress our offerings to both consumers and dealers, we strive to uphold and improve the quality of the connections between consumers and dealers and become the marketplace for all steps of the vehicle acquisition and purchase process, ultimately giving dealers and consumers the power to reach their destination.
 Consumers' Challenges
As consumers complete the end-to-end car shopping journey, the key questions they ask are:
•Am I getting a fair price for my trade-in? 
 •Should I purchase a vehicle with my trade-in? 
 •What type of vehicle should I buy? 
 •Where can I buy a car like this? 
 •What is a fair price for this particular type of vehicle? 
 •Have others had a good experience buying from this dealer? 
 •How much of the purchase process can I transact online?
 •Can I obtain financing for this car, and at what cost?
 •What if this dealer is not local to my area? 
 In answering these questions, consumers historically had limited access to transparent information on specific vehicles, car pricing, and dealer reputation. Further, consumers who wanted to trade-in their vehicle or wanted to complete select elements of their car shopping journey online typically had very limited options. Every car-shopping journey is a unique experience, and so for consumers embarking on this journey, there is a difficulty in the absence of consistent information on pricing for both selling and purchasing vehicles. Selling a vehicle was time-consuming and exhausting for consumers as they travelled dealer to dealer to ensure they were receiving a fair and accurate price for their vehicle. Selecting the right dealer was also challenging for consumers as dealer reputations were historically based primarily on word-of-mouth. The lack of clear, transparent information made it difficult for consumers to effectively compare vehicles, find the vehicles that best suited their needs and transact with well-regarded dealers. In addition, especially as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers are also increasingly interested in understanding which aspects of their buying journey they can complete online and are looking for ways to customize their journey to incorporate both online and in-person components.
Dealers' Challenges
Dealers have had to face a new set of challenges in the past year as a result of the worldwide semiconductor chip shortage impacting auto manufacturers' production levels. The shortage of both used and new car inventory over the past year has caused dealers to invest in additional methods to fill their lots as many physical wholesale auctions were impacted by the continued COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, dealers have needed to remain competitive in their offers for consumer trade-ins, as consumers have increasing means to source multiple offers in this highly competitive market. The economics of dealerships depend largely on vehicle acquisition costs, sales volume, and customer acquisition efficiency. To achieve a high return on their marketing investments, dealers must find in-market consumers; yet because consumers may not frequently purchase a vehicle, only a small percentage of consumers are actively shopping for a car at any specific point in time. Dealers additionally need to be strategic about selling vehicles before they are “aged inventory.” Traditional marketing channels that dealers utilize, including television, radio, and newspaper, can effectively target locally but are inefficient in targeting the narrow percentage of consumers who are actively in the market to buy a car. In addition, used car pricing is fluid because it is based on rapidly shifting supply and demand dynamics. Dealers need to find ways to manage constantly changing inventory and adjust pricing and purchasing strategies to adapt to frequently changing market conditions as evidenced by the previous year.
Our Strengths
We believe that our competitive advantages are based on the following key strengths:
Trusted Marketplace for Consumers. We provide consumers with transparent information, intuitive search results, and other tools that aid them in their car-shopping journey. Furthermore, consumers can have confidence in the quality of the vehicles they search for in our marketplaces since less than one-third of eligible vehicle listings on CarGurus.com earn a Great Deal or Good Deal rating. We also enable bids on vehicle trade-ins and sales from the thousands of dealers in the CarGurus/CarOffer network, assuring consumers that they are receiving the best offer on their vehicle. We offer the largest online selection of new and used car listings of any major U.S. online automotive marketplace. We aggregate and analyze these listings using proprietary technology and data along with innovative data analytics to create a differentiated automotive search experience for consumers to bring them “Great Deals from Top-Rated Dealers.” In 2021, we experienced over 79.3 million average monthly sessions in the United States. We believe this user traffic, an indicator of consumer satisfaction and engagement, is critical to our marketplace success and will continue to strengthen our market position. We attract our audience from a diverse range of acquisition channels including, but not limited to, direct navigation, mobile applications, email, organic search, paid search advertising, social media advertising, on-site advertising, audience targeting, and brand advertising campaigns. In addition, we focus our efforts on attracting users that we believe are near a car purchasing decision, resulting in a higher quality audience to which our dealers can market.
Proprietary Search Algorithms and Data-Driven Approach. We have built an extensive repository of data on cars, prices, dealers, and the interactions between consumers and dealers that is the result of many years of data aggregation and regression modeling. The primary product of this analysis is our determination of a used car’s IMV, which, together with Dealer Rating, drives our Deal Rating. We calculate IMV by applying more than 20 ranking signals and more than 100 normalization rules to tens of millions of data points, including the make, model, trim, year, features, condition, history, geographic location, and mileage of the car. With our acquisition of CarOffer in 2021, we have extended our proprietary search algorithms and data analytics to CarOffer’s Buying Matrix providing unique insights to dealers regarding their purchases in the wholesale space as well as up-to-date pricing information for the consumers they are servicing. We apply the knowledge gained from analyzing the substantial volume of connections between consumers and dealers on our platform to build new features for our consumers, IMV technology features on the Dealer Dashboard and new products for our dealers. These enhancements enable more informed consumers and dealers from the start of their car journey to the end.
Strong Value Proposition to Dealers. We believe that our marketplace offers an efficient customer acquisition channel for dealers, helping them achieve attractive returns on their marketing spend with us. With the acquisition of CarOffer, we have only increased efficiencies for dealers to source vehicles from both consumers and other dealers with the 24/7 online buy matrix. We provide our dealer base with connections to prospective car buyers; most of these connections have historically been for used cars, and to prospective car sellers. The primary objective of our traffic acquisition and site improvements is to generate greater volumes of consumer leads to our dealers. These leads include phone calls, email, and managed text and chat interactions for dealers, which we believe yield the highest value engagement for dealers. Dealers are able to leverage our large consumer audience, our digital retail offerings and consumer trade-in service to provide more quality leads to their dealership, providing the highest return on their investment. We provide all dealers with tools that are informed by real-time market conditions that help them acquire inventory, merchandise and sell their cars, and our paying dealers get access to additional valuable information from our Pricing Tool and Market Analysis tool. Additionally, with digital retail offerings we help level the online offering playing field for our dealer partners who are unable to provide these solutions to consumers on their own and/or wish to utilize our largest consumer audience to sell additional inventory with CarGurus' digital retail offerings. Our strong value proposition to the dealer community is evidenced by our 6% growth in quarterly average revenue per subscribing dealer, or QARSD, in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
  Network Effects Driven by Scale. With the majority of dealers in the United States listing inventory on our platform and having built the most visited online automotive marketplace in the United States, we believe that our scale creates powerful network effects that reinforce the competitive strength of our business model. This powerful network has only strengthened with our acquisition of CarOffer, as we are now able to provide dealers with opportunities to sell their inventory to other dealers. The launch of new digital offerings and IMCO has only increased our network as more consumers are attracted to our site to trade-in their vehicle or complete a portion of their car-shopping journey online, perpetuating even more leads to dealers increasing our appeal and incentivizing more dealers to subscribe to our paid Listings packages to access the numerous benefits unavailable to nonpaying dealers. Displaying listings from more paying dealers on our websites provides consumers with more dealer information and methods to contact those dealers. More consumers and connections drive greater value and a higher return to paying dealers’ marketing spend on our platform. Driven by these network effects, we continue to amass data points, which we use to further strengthen our traffic acquisition efforts and marketplace search algorithms, the utility of analysis complementing each listing, the quality of our user experience, the quality of our partnership with dealers to provide digital offerings, the value of connections between consumers and dealers as well as between dealers themselves, and the efficacy of our dealer digital marketing products.
Attractive Financial Model. We have a strong track record of revenue growth, profitability, and capital efficiency. We generated revenue of $951.4 million in 2021 compared to $551.5 million in 2020, representing a year-over-year increase of 73%. A significant portion of our revenue is recurring due to the subscription nature of our products, including from our Listings packages, our Real-time Performance Marketing, or RPM, digital advertising suite, and our CarOffer online wholesale platform. Furthermore, our revenue base is highly diversified due to the fragmented nature of the automotive dealer industry. We also have been able to grow and invest in our future growth while improving profitability due to the operating leverage in our business model. Our consolidated net income grew 42% in 2021 and 84% in 2020. As a percentage of revenue, our consolidated net income margin was 12% in 2021, compared with 14% in 2020. On a consolidated basis, our Adjusted EBITDA grew 55% in 2021 and 109% in 2020. As a percentage of revenue, our Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26% in 2021, compared with 29% in 2020. In the United States, which is our most developed market, we increased our income from operations to $158.5 million in 2021 from $120.8 million in 2020. See the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Key Business Metrics–Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.
 Experienced Management Team with Culture of Innovation. Our founder, Executive Chairman and Chairman of our Board of Directors, Langley Steinert, co‑founded and was previously chairman of TripAdvisor, an online marketplace for travel‑related content based on the mission of using technology and a data‑driven approach to provide transparency for consumers’ travel planning. Led by Mr. Steinert and a management team with extensive experience guiding technology companies in evolving industries – including Jason Trevisan, our Chief Executive Officer and Sam Zales, our President and Chief Operating Officer – we bring the same commitment to fostering a culture of innovation and delivering data-driven transparency to the automotive market.

Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business
 The outbreak in 2020 of the novel strain of coronavirus that surfaced in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and was subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, or COVID-19, resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity including worldwide travel restrictions, prohibitions of non-essential work activities, disruption and shutdown of businesses and uncertainty in global financial markets. Recently identified variants of COVID-19, Delta and Omicron, which appear to be more transmissible and contagious than previous COVID-19 variants, have caused an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases globally. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an impact on global economic activity, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely impact our future business operations, financial performance and results of operations is uncertain and will depend on many factors outside of our control. For a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties and actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Item 1A “Risk Factors”.
 Our Products
 Transaction-Enabled Marketplace
 Consumer Experience
 We provide consumers an online automotive marketplace where they can search for new and used car listings from our dealers and sell their cars to dealers and other consumers. A user accesses our marketplace through our websites or by using our mobile applications. Most users specify whether they are searching for used, certified pre‑owned, or new cars and then provide their desired vehicle make and model and their postal code. Our product offerings described below are available for the U.S. CarGurus marketplace; their availability on our other marketplaces varies. We also offer paid listings subscriptions for dealers and dealer advertising products for the PistonHeads website, as well as paid listings subscriptions for dealers for the Autolist website.
 Used and Certified Pre‑Owned Cars
 Using our proprietary search algorithms, we immediately display the results of the consumer’s search, ranked by Deal Rating, on a search results page, or SRP. Eligible used car listings in our marketplace are assigned one of five Deal Ratings: Great Deal, Good Deal, Fair Deal, High Priced, or Overpriced. A Deal Rating illustrates how competitive a listing is compared to similar cars sold in the same region in recent history. A listing’s Deal Rating is based primarily upon the IMV of the vehicle and the Dealer Rating of the dealer.
 Instant Market Value. IMV is a proprietary algorithm that assesses the market value of a used vehicle in a local market and is a key input for determining a vehicle’s Deal Rating. The IMV algorithm is the product of many years of regression modeling utilizing tens of millions of used car data points. IMV takes into account a number of factors, including comparable currently listed and previously sold used cars in the local market and vehicle details including make, model, trim, year, features, condition, history, and mileage. The IMV algorithm uses more than 20 ranking signals and more than 100 normalization rules that distill unstructured data from hundreds of sources across thousands of dealers.
 Dealer Ratings. Dealer Ratings are derived from user‑generated content from our users’ experiences with dealers with which they have connected. To promote high‑quality reviews, we require that a user have interacted with the dealer via our marketplace to submit a review. We believe this requirement, together with additional qualification standards, results in a more valuable Dealer Rating. Dealer Rating is an important component of a listing’s Deal Rating and, as a result, can impact the organic search position of a listing.
 Search Results Page. In addition to each car’s Deal Rating, our SRP provides users with other useful information, including the difference between the listing price and the IMV that we have determined for the car, mileage, Dealer Rating, and dealer location for paying dealers. We provide in‑depth search filters, including price, year, mileage, trim, color, options, condition, body style, miles per gallon, seating capacity, vehicle ownership history, usage history, seller type, and days on market, among others, which we believe deliver the most comprehensive search capability among major U.S. online automotive marketplaces. We also provide our users with additional features to aid their search, including similar vehicle recommendations, side‑by‑side vehicle comparisons, expert reviews, and user rankings. Our platform also gives users the ability to save searches and receive alerts that keep them informed of relevant developments in the market, including newly available inventory and price changes to cars they are monitoring.
 Vehicle Detail Page. If a user clicks on one of the listings on the SRP, the user is taken to that listing’s vehicle detail page, or VDP. VDPs are designed to provide numerous photos and a comprehensive description of the vehicle, dealer name, address, and dealership information for paying dealers, detailed dealer reviews, methods to contact the dealer, payment calculators, and helpful information about the vehicle, including:

•Price History. Changes to a vehicle’s price on our platform. We also offer price change alerts to consumers on searches they have saved, which allow them to respond quickly to changes in the market.
 •Time on Site. Length of time a vehicle has been on our platform and how many users have saved the vehicle to their list of favorite listings, indicators of the likely demand for the vehicle.
 •Vehicle History. Title check, accident check, number of owners, and fleet status of the vehicle, giving consumers data that helps them better understand the vehicle’s condition.
 New Cars
 Search results for new car listings are sorted by price of inventory matching the user’s search, with the lowest priced listings sorted first. Our new car VDPs include our Dealer Rating and many of the other features of our used car listings, such as Price History and Time on Site. Deal Rating is not applicable to new car listings because it utilizes data not relevant to new cars. Instead, we analyze data on manufacturers’ suggested retail prices, or MSRPs, and recent sales of similar new vehicles, accounting for trade-ins, incentives, and other factors that can affect the price of a new car, to provide users with comparative price information.
Sell My Car
 We also allow our consumers to list their cars in both our peer-to-peer and consumer-to-dealer marketplaces in the United States. Our peer-to-peer offering, Sell My Car, enables individual car owners to easily merchandise their vehicles, determine an appropriate selling price with our proprietary price guidance, and manage their listings and communications with prospective buyers from our audience. We collect a fee when a consumer lists a vehicle on the peer-to-peer marketplace. See “— Wholesale and Consumer-to-Dealer” below for a description of our consumer-to-dealer offering, IMCO.
Autolist
 Autolist provides consumers an online automotive marketplace through mobile applications on iOS and Android phones, as well as a website. The platform includes inventory from top automotive dealers across the U.S. and gives consumers quick access to manage their search on the go with real-time alerts of newly available inventory and changes that occur on cars and saved searches they have configured. An independent editorial staff produces content to keep consumers informed on the latest vehicles and trends in the automotive market.
 PistonHeads
 PistonHeads is a U.K. automotive marketplace, forum, and editorial site geared towards automotive enthusiasts. The platform allows consumers to search across a broad range of dealer and private seller listings, engage with other automotive enthusiasts through forums, and stay informed about automotive news through editorial articles and expert reviews. Paying U.K. dealers who list on the CarGurus platform automatically have their inventory added to the PistonHeads site for greater consumer reach.
 Dealer Offerings
Listings
 Our marketplace connects dealers to a large audience of informed and engaged consumers. We offer multiple types of marketplace Listings subscriptions to dealers for the CarGurus U.S. platform (availability varies on our other marketplaces): Restricted Listings, which is free, and various levels of Listings packages, each of which requires a paid subscription. We price our paid Listings packages as a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual subscription based on the dealer’s inventory size, region, and our assessment of the ROI our solution will provide them.
 •Restricted Listings. We allow non‑paying dealers to list their inventory in our marketplace as Restricted Listings. Restricted Listings do not display the name, address, website URL, or phone number of the relevant dealer and are subject to other limitations. Consumers can contact these dealers only through an anonymous, CarGurus‑branded email address so the dealer does not receive any of the consumer’s personal contact information from our platform. Dealers in our Restricted Listings tier are limited in the number of consumer connections they can receive in a month, with caps on lead volume based on the dealers’ inventory size. 

•Paid Listings Subscriptions. Paying dealers are able to subscribe to one of four Listings package levels: Standard, Enhanced, Featured or Featured Priority. These paid Listings packages are designed to provide dealers with a higher volume and quality of connections and leads from consumers than our Restricted Listings option. Dealers that subscribe to a paid Listings package gain the opportunity to connect with consumers directly through email, phone, and – excluding Standard Listings subscriptions – managed text and chat, an offering by which consumers communicate via real-time chat or text message with our agents who act on behalf of dealers. Listings for all paying dealers on our websites include a link to their website, dealership branding and information such as name, address, and hours of operation, and map directions to their dealership, helping consumers easily contact or visit the dealer, which we believe results in increased local brand awareness and walk‑in traffic. A dealer that subscribes to our Featured or Featured Priority Listings package receives the same benefits of the Standard and Enhanced Listings packages, as well as opportunities for promotion of their Great Deal, Good Deal, and Fair Deal used inventory as well as their new inventory in a clearly labeled section at the top of the SRP as well as on the VDP of dealers in the Restricted Listings package. Featured Priority listings are specifically promoted in the first position of the SRP. This premium placement for Featured and Featured Priority listings generates increased connection volume relative to Standard or Enhanced Listings packages. In addition, a dealer that pays for our Enhanced, Featured or Featured Priority Listings package may subscribe to our Area Boost offering, which expands the visibility of a dealer’s inventory in the search results beyond its local market. 
 Dealer Dashboard and Merchandising Tools
 All dealers with inventory on CarGurus may access the following Dealer Dashboard features and merchandising tools:
 •Performance Summary. Provides dealers with real‑time and historical data concerning the connections and consumer exposure they have received in our marketplace and through our digital marketing products. This enables dealers to analyze connections and SRP and VDP views at a granular level to inform the dealer’s sales and merchandising efforts.
 •Dealer Insights. Provides pricing analysis of the dealer’s inventory, as well as a summary of a vehicle’s missing information such as price, photos, or trim. This information helps dealers better merchandise their vehicles.
 •User Review Management. Allows dealers to track and manage – but not edit or manipulate – their dealer reviews from our users. Dealers can respond to users, report potentially fraudulent reviews, and publish positive reviews to social media platforms for broader exposure.
 Dealers subscribing to a paid Listings package also have access to the following additional features and tools:
 •Pricing Tool. Helps dealers evaluate the impact of pricing changes for each used vehicle in their inventory and the resulting impact on the car’s Deal Rating, empowering dealers to make informed pricing decisions based on market data in their local area.
 •Market Analysis. Informs dealers of local market trends in used cars, such as the most searched makes and models in their local market. This information helps dealers align with local consumer preferences and inform strategies for increasing inventory turnover and efficient vehicle acquisition.
 •IMV Scan. Allows dealers to scan a vehicle identification number, or VIN, using their smartphone, and receive information on the IMV of the vehicle in order to support dealers in deciding what to pay for a vehicle at a wholesale auto auction. IMV Scan is built into the CarGurus mobile app and is currently available to U.S. dealers that pay for our Enhanced, Featured or Featured Priority Listings packages. 
 Digital Marketing Products
We offer dealers subscribing to one of our Enhanced, Featured or Featured Priority Listings packages access to additional advertising products marketed primarily under our RPM digital advertising suite. With RPM, dealers can reach our large and engaged automotive shopping audience through on-site advertising that appears in our CarGurus marketplace, on other sites on the internet and/or on high-converting social media platforms. RPM helps dealers build brand awareness and acquire customers to their website and dealership. Advertisements can be targeted by the user’s geography, search history, CarGurus website activity and a number of other targeting factors. This product suite allows dealers to increase their visibility with in-market consumers and drive qualified traffic to their websites.
Pricing and Packaging
We offer our Listings product suite through a tiered set of packages. Listings are priced on a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual subscription basis based on the dealer’s inventory size, region, and our assessment of the ROI we expect to deliver. For improved performance, dealers can purchase higher Listings suite levels and add-ons available at an existing Listings suite level. Dealers may be renewed at higher rates commensurate with growth and updated performance expectations. RPM is also packaged in a tiered solution, and priced as a percentage of Listings while accounting for factors such as dealership characteristics and performance expectations.
 Wholesale and Consumer-to-Dealer
 Digital Wholesale
 As the automotive industry continues to move further online, it has become even more important for dealers not only to sell their vehicles effectively at retail, but also to acquire the right inventory in the first place via wholesale transactions. In recent years, wholesale vehicle sales have begun shifting online and those trends have accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The industry is moving away from traditional in-person physical auction models and towards online transactions that are easier, faster, and reduce the effect of geographic constraints.
 In January 2021, we completed our acquisition of a 51% ownership interest in CarOffer, a modern-day automotive inventory transaction platform that allows dealers and dealer groups to buy, sell, and trade online with automation and ease. The acquisition added wholesale vehicle acquisition and selling capabilities to our portfolio of dealer offerings, creating a powerful new digital solution for dealers to sell and acquire vehicles at both retail and wholesale. Unlike traditional vehicle auctions which require manual bidding and vehicle evaluation, CarOffer’s proprietary Buying Matrix technology enables buying dealers to create standing buy orders and provides instant offers to selling dealers.
 Consumer-to-Dealer Offering
 During 2020, we conducted a pilot that enabled dealers to purchase inventory directly from consumers who visited our site. The consumer entered their vehicle information on the Sell My Car page, and we helped facilitate the transaction with the buying dealer. We collected a transaction fee from the dealer for this service.
In 2021, our CarOffer acquisition also helped facilitate our launch of an updated consumer offering, IMCO, which allows consumers in certain states to sell their vehicles to dealers entirely online. This offering provides dealers access to a fresh source of trade-in inventory and helps ensure liquidity amongst CarOffer’s platform. Through IMCO, consumers who are trading-in or selling vehicles enter easy-to-answer questions regarding their vehicle and are instantly presented with the most competitive offer sourced from in-network dealers. Once the customer has saved their offer, they can further customize their experience by arranging a location of their choice to have the vehicle picked-up and transported. In this model, CarOffer processes the transaction directly and collects transaction and other fees from the dealer.
 Digital Retail
 In recent years, both consumer demand and dealer receptiveness to digital retail has increased, as consumers have become more comfortable transacting some or all of their car buying processes online. We are focused on addressing the needs of both consumers and dealers in this growing segment of automotive digital retail.
Consumer Finance
 Through our partnerships with automotive lending companies, we allow eligible consumers on our U.S. marketplace to pre-qualify for financing on cars from dealerships that offer financing from these partners. We primarily generate revenue from these partnerships based on the number of funded loans from consumers who pre-qualify with our lending partners through our site. We believe this program both provides more transparency to car shoppers about actual payments to be offered at the dealership specific to participating lenders, as well as delivers highly qualified car shopper leads to participating dealers.
Area Boost
 We offer the ability for dealerships to expand their VDP geographic footprint to non-local customers via dealer home delivery services. Revenue is generated through fees charged to the dealership to enable listings beyond the default geographical radius. We believe this program provides additional vehicle options to car shoppers open to home delivery services while promoting participating dealers’ delivery capabilities and increasing non-local VDP views.
Buy Online
 We continue to offer consumers the ability to transact additional elements of their car buying experience through our websites as they seek to complete more of this process online. For example, our shoppers can ‘start purchase’ or ‘buy now’ from a VDP on eligible listings and utilize purchase options, including but not limited to estimating a car’s trade-in value, deciding payment options, selecting finance and insurance products, and placing a reservation deposit.
Auto Manufacturer and Other Advertiser Products
 Our platform offers auto manufacturers and others the ability to purchase advertising on both our sites and third‑party websites, including social media platforms, to execute targeted marketing strategies:
 •Brand Reinforcement. We allow auto manufacturers to buy advertising on both our sites and third‑party websites, including social media platforms, to target consumers based on the make, model, and postal code of the cars that a specific consumer is searching for, in order to increase exposure to interested consumers.
 •Category Sponsorship. To address evolving priorities influenced by industry dynamics, seasonality, and other factors, we offer the ability to sponsor exclusively prominent high traffic pages on our sites, such as the New Car front page, Used Car front page, and Research Center.
 •Automobile Segment Exclusivity. To support the introduction of new models or the success of existing models, we allow manufacturers to target specific automobile segments, such as SUV, sedan, hybrid, luxury, truck, and minivan.
 •Consumer Segment Exposure. Auto manufacturers can target consumers both on CarGurus and third‑party websites, including social media platforms, based on various parameters, including estimated household income and vehicle specifications, such as make or model, and postal codes.
 International
We also facilitate high-intent consumers to engage with automotive dealers in both Canada and the U.K. Like our U.S. offerings, CarGurus provides consumers in Canada and the U.K. with a transparent shopping experience, using our proprietary algorithms to determine market specific valuations for vehicles, and ordinating our organic search results based on Deal Ratings.
In Canada, CarGurus is a leading automotive marketplace that provides consumers a transparent shopping experience whether they are looking for a new or used car. In the U.K., CarGurus is a leading marketplace for dealers’ listings of used vehicles, providing consumers with one of the broadest selections of inventory in the U.K. We also provide automotive shoppers rich expert review content, an active forum for automotive discussion, and offer privately owned inventory through the PistonHeads website.
 Marketing and Brand
Consumer Marketing
 CarGurus is the most visited online automotive marketplace in the United States, with more than 79.3 million and 31.6 million average monthly sessions and unique users, respectively in 2021. We have built our audience on the strength of our user experience, and remain focused on delivering an industry-leading consumer marketplace. Our intuitive search experience, combined with the largest inventory of any major U.S. online automotive marketplace and relevant content, updates, and tools provide unparalleled transparency and decision-support to consumers during their car search to help them buy with confidence. The strength of our consumer experience is one of our most powerful marketing tools, with “word of mouth” representing the second-most cited influence on consumers decision to visit CarGurus despite our substantial investments in paid marketing. This leading consumer experience also enables CarGurus to perform very well with search engines, generating a significant volume of free traffic from high-intent car shoppers.
A key pillar of our consumer marketing efforts is what we call algorithmic traffic acquisition. We employ a team of strategists, engineers and data scientists that optimizes our user acquisition through search engines, social media, and other digital marketing channels and has tested over one billion keywords on various search engines as well as sophisticated, personalized re-marketing, to nurture consumers toward finding their right car. The sophistication of our data-driven algorithmic traffic acquisition continues to advance, with an ongoing focus on increasingly data-driven campaigns that drive high return on advertising spend. We believe our expertise in this area constitutes a competitive advantage over less sophisticated competitors and those who outsource these capabilities.
 In parallel with our sophisticated paid and organic traffic acquisition efforts, we invest significant resources in optimizing our site experience and retention marketing efforts, including through email and app notifications, to help consumers find the right car for them and connect with a dealer to make a purchase. Rigorous conversion rate optimization efforts help increase the ROI on our advertising spend. Our increasing focus on merchandising that drives more shoppers to connect with dealers with high subscription expansion opportunity is intended to create a virtuous cycle of improved monetization that allows for reinvestment in further improvements to our consumer experience.
 We augment our performance marketing, conversion rate optimization and retention marketing efforts with brand‑building efforts. Our brand marketing efforts are primarily comprised of (i) investments in media, including television and online video, (ii) expressing our unique brand value proposition throughout our core site experience and organic social channels, and (iii) an active public relations program that allows us to gain significant, high-credibility earned media coverage. Despite a shorter tenure and lower investment in brand marketing than our primary competitors, we have made significant progress toward closing our brand awareness gaps since launching brand marketing in 2017 and believe that we are well‑positioned to continue to strengthen our brand by continuing to invest in brand-building efforts and refining the articulation of our unique value proposition. As we close the awareness gap compared to our primary competitors, we see significant opportunity to shift our brand focus from reach to driving greater understanding of and preference for our brand, further accelerating the strong consumer engagement and word of mouth benefits we already enjoy.
 Dealer Marketing
 The primary goals of our dealer marketing initiatives are to acquire dealers not yet in our marketplace, convert non‑paying dealers into paying dealers, retain our existing paying dealers, and increase product adoption and usage from our paying dealers. Our dealer marketing efforts aim to:
 •Educate Dealers on the End-to-End Inventory Solutions We Offer, the Quality of Our Audience and Products, and Attractive ROI. We educate dealers on the increased breadth of solutions we offer, including wholesale buying and selling of inventory, marketing via our core Listings products and other tools, and our growing suite of retailing solutions. We promote the quality of our audience by touting our industry‑leading audience, our strong user engagement, and the large number of connections that we facilitate through our marketplace. We also highlight to dealers how unique features of our platform, such as our consumer financing features and proprietary IMV analytics, yield consumers that we believe are more informed and better prepared to purchase at the dealership, which can lead to a higher ROI for the dealers’ marketing spend.
 •Provide Thought Leadership that Educates Dealers on Industry Trends. We generate insightful content on market trends and best practices in digital advertising that are shared through webinars, dealer forums, dealer advisory councils, our websites, and our participation in industry conferences and events. From time to time, we also host thought leadership events in local markets and an automotive conference, Navigate, to continue to share our insights and help build our brand among dealerships. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we shifted almost all of our in-person events, including Navigate, to fully virtual events to continue to provide thought leadership to dealers during these challenging times. In particular, we helped address their challenges by sharing the latest research and data-driven insights on how shopper behavior has evolved and continues to evolve during this global pandemic. 
 •Provide Best Practices to Assist Dealers in Becoming More Successful. We provide ongoing communications through email, webinars, white papers, testimonials, and videos, which show dealers how to use our products to position their inventory for success on our platform and beyond , as well as broader guidance on marketing, sales, operations, and other aspects of running a more profitable dealership. We maintain consistent communication with dealers via email, events and our Dealer Dashboard to ensure awareness of account performance and recent product updates, and we empower our sales and account management teams with resources to directly provide education and assistance to our dealer partners.
•Drive Product Engagement. We use our email marketing capabilities and other marketing channels to drive dealer engagement with our products and platforms. This can include automated, personalized marketing about how dealers can improve vehicle pricing and merchandising by using the tools in our dashboard, performance insights around the leads and connections they are receiving, and prompts to respond to reviews and manage their reputation. We also monitor dealer feedback on our products through surveys and product engagement to assess areas for further development or dealer education.
Competition
 We face competition to attract consumers and paying dealers to our marketplaces and services and to attract advertisers to purchase our advertising products and services. Our competitors offer various marketplaces, products, and services that compete with us. Some of these competitors include:
 •major U.S. online automotive marketplaces: AutoTrader.com, Cars.com, and TrueCar.com;
 •other U.S. automotive websites, such as Edmunds.com, KBB.com and Carfax.com;
 •online automotive marketplaces and websites in our international markets;
 •online dealerships, such as Carvana and Vroom;
 •sites operated by individual automobile dealers;
 •internet search engines;
 •social media marketplaces;
 •peer-to-peer marketplaces, such as Craigslist; and
 •vehicle auction companies, including digital wholesale platforms.
 Competition for Consumers and Dealers
 We compete for consumer visits with other online automotive marketplaces, free listing services, general search engines, online dealerships and dealers’ websites. We compete for consumers primarily on the basis of the quality of the consumer experience and the breadth of offerings that we are able to provide. We believe we compete favorably on user experience due to the number of our vehicle listings, the transparency of the information we provide on cars, prices, and dealers, the intuitive nature of our user interface, and our mobile user experience, among other factors.
 We compete for dealers’ marketing spend with offline customer acquisition channels, other online automotive marketplaces, dealers’ own customer acquisition efforts on search engines and social media marketplaces, and other internet sites, online dealerships and vehicle auction companies that attract consumers and dealers searching for vehicles, as applicable. We compete primarily on the basis of the ROI that our marketplace offers and the synergies provided by the combination of our foundational listings business with digital wholesale and digital retail offerings. We believe we compete favorably due to our large user audience, high user engagement, and the volume and quality of connections we provide to well-informed consumers, which results in an attractive ROI for dealers.
 Competition for Advertisers
 We compete for a share of advertisers’ total marketing budgets against media sites, websites dedicated to helping consumers shop for cars, major internet portals, search engines, and social media sites, among others. We also compete for a share of advertisers’ overall marketing budgets with traditional media, such as television, radio, magazines, newspapers, automotive publications, billboards, and other offline advertising channels. We compete for advertising spend based on the marketing ROI that our marketplace provides. We believe we compete favorably due to our large user audience size, high user engagement, and the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising products.
Seasonality
Across the retail automotive industry, consumer purchases are typically greatest in the first three quarters of each year, due in part to the introduction of new vehicle models from manufacturers and the seasonal nature of consumer spending. Additionally, the volume of wholesale vehicle sales can fluctuate from quarter to quarter caused by several factors, including the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers, the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles and/or inventory challenges in the automotive industry, which affect the demand side of the wholesale industry. Macroeconomic conditions, such as the global semiconductor chip shortage, can also effect the volume of wholesale vehicle sales. To date, our overall operating results have not reflected the general seasonality of the automotive industry or wholesale vehicle sales market, but this could possibly change once our business and markets mature.
Sales
 Our sales team is responsible for bringing dealers onto our marketplace, converting non-paying dealers to paid subscriptions and increasing dealer participation in new products that CarGurus is bringing to market. We have built an efficient sales and service team of approximately 300 employees worldwide who sell our marketplace products to franchise and independent dealers. We have built a field sales team that works with strategic franchise and national dealership groups in large metropolitan areas in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. In addition, we have advertising sales employees based in the U.S. and Canada.
 We have a comprehensive dealer account management process to assist dealers in becoming successful in our marketplace. We assign a Customer Success Associate to every new paying Listings dealer to assist with on-boarding and integration with any relevant software systems. The designated Customer Success Associate spends time educating dealers on a range of topics, including effectively using the Dealer Dashboard, tracking sales, and measuring ROI for their marketing spend. After the on-boarding period, a Dealer Relations Account Manager is designated to assist the dealer in utilizing our tools and maximizing ROI from our offerings, including effectively pricing vehicles, vehicle merchandising, and keeping inventory up to date with complete vehicle information. We believe our active communication with our dealers fosters customer satisfaction and increases customer retention.
 People and Talent
 Our investment in our greatest asset – our people – is integral to our core values, evidenced by our inclusion of employee engagement, retention targets and cultural efforts as components of our 2021 strategic and organizational initiatives. Our Board of Directors oversees our people and talent efforts and views building our culture – from employee development and retention to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging initiatives – as key to driving long-term value for our business and helping to mitigate risks.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,203 full-time employees, 75 of whom were based outside the United States and 288 of whom were employed through CarOffer. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 Culture, Values and Standards
 Our company culture has developed out of our data-driven and innovative approach to the automotive market. We leverage data to drive innovation across all facets of our business and continuously optimize our products and processes to serve our consumers, dealers, advertisers, and partners. Our approach emphasizes original thought, impact, and collaboration across our organization, and we recognize and award employees who drive positive results across these constituencies. We invest in creating a work environment that facilitates partnership among our employees and promotes diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging. In that spirit, we have identified our core values as follows:
 •We are pioneering. From the beginning, we set out to radically change how people buy and sell cars. We tackle difficult problems head on. We are curious. We are risk takers. We embrace change even if it’s uncomfortable.
 •We are transparent. We believe transparency is the foundation of trust and enables better decision making. We communicate clearly and honestly. We deliver unbiased guidance. Our products, services and company culture are built on these principles.
 •We are data-driven. We rely on data, not hunches, to make decisions. We listen to our instincts but we validate through rapid testing, learning and optimizing. We translate complex data into actionable insights for our users, our customers and our people. 

•We are collaborative. We celebrate our individual strengths and perspectives but know that our success requires teamwork. We partner, we listen and we leverage feedback from each other, our users and our customers.
 •We move quickly. We believe there’s power in speed. We iterate quickly and often, continuously improving as we go. We are not afraid to break things. If we fail, we do it fast, learn from it and move on. 
 •We have integrity. We act responsibly and consider the impact of our actions on each other, our partners and the world around us. We believe empathy, respect and fairness are essential. We set high ethical standards and expect principled leadership from our people. 
 Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging and Equal Employment Policy
 We are an equal opportunity employer and strive to build and nurture a culture where inclusiveness is a reflex, not an initiative. With support from our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Advisory Team, we seek to foster diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, and to build a workplace where everyone can thrive. Our commitment to these efforts helps us attract and retain the best talent, enables employees to realize their full potential and drives high performance through innovation and collaboration. In 2021, based on data from employees who chose to self-identify, we increased representation among women and non-binary employees (32.8% to 35.1%) and underrepresented racial minorities (30.0% to 30.1%) within our U.S. workforce. We also saw year-over-year increases in the U.S. among women and non-binary employees in technical (23.3% to 25.9%) and management-level roles (34.2% to 38.6%), as well as among underrepresented racial minorities in technical roles (43.6% to 45.7%).
Compensation and Benefits
 The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we provide our eligible employees with competitive wages and access to flexible and convenient medical programs intended to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In addition to standard medical coverage, we offer the following benefits to our U.S. employees (availability internationally varies): dental and vision coverage, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, flexible work schedules on a case-by-case basis, employee assistance programs, short term and long term disability insurance and term life insurance, as well as paid access to certain wellness and family care resources. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. These changes included requiring our employees to work from home.
Employee Engagement
 Each year, we conduct an employee engagement survey to help our management team gain insight into and gauge employees’ feelings, attitudes, and behaviors around working at CarGurus. Our latest survey, completed in September 2021, had a participation rate of approximately 85% of our eligible employees worldwide. The survey results indicated that we excelled in areas including manager empathy, career development, belonging, as well as overall excitement about CarGurus’ future. Based on employee feedback, we also identified certain company-wide opportunity areas to improve engagement and drive long-term success. Our culture and commitment to building a workplace where we can all thrive has been recognized externally with the following awards: Built In Boston’s “Best Places to Work” in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022; the Mass TLC “Tech Top 50” Company Culture in 2020; Fortune’s “Best Places to Work” in 2019; Computerworld’s “Best Places to Work in IT” in 2019 and 2020; Boston Business Journal’s “Best Places to Work” in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021; Boston Globe’s “Top Place to Work” in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2018; and Comparably’s 2021 “Best Perks & Benefits”, “Best Work-Life Balance”, and “Best CEO”.
Training and Development
 Our people and talent strategy is essential for our ability to continue to develop and market innovative products and customer solutions. We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities, including mandatory quarterly compliance training courses as well as one-on-one, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, and external development. In 2021, nearly 100% of our employees participated in learning and development activities worldwide.
Technology and Product Development
 We are a technology company focused on innovative, actionable data analysis. We design our mobile and web products to create a transparent experience for both consumers and dealers. We believe in rapid development, release frequent updates and have internal tools and automation that allow us to efficiently evolve our products. Our software is built using a combination of internally developed software, third-party software and services, and open source software.
Our Search Technology
 Our search and ranking technology is served by a proprietary in‑memory search index solution that is scalable, fast, and extensible. We have highly flexible interfaces that allow dealers to automatically add their inventory to our index, enabling us to quickly integrate hundreds of inventory sources with minimal effort and easily support inventory growth.
Our Mobile Technology
 We have designed our marketplace to appeal to mobile users by developing our products with a mobile‑first mindset. All of our search results pages use a single‑page application type approach to eliminate page reloads and improve responsiveness. We also use techniques to load content onto a user’s mobile device more efficiently.
Our Integrations
 We make available several application program interfaces and web widgets that integrate with customer relationship management and inventory management solutions, among other platforms. These integrations allow dealers to incorporate designated data and tools into the fabric of their marketing and customer engagement strategies. For example, our Deal Rating Badges are used on dealer websites, which show our Deal Rating for cars that have been rated as a Great Deal, Good Deal, or Fair Deal. Our Deal Rating serves as trusted, third‑party validation on dealer websites.
Infrastructure
 Our development servers and U.S. and Canadian websites are hosted at third-party data centers in the U.S. near each of Boston, Massachusetts and Dallas, Texas, as well as through third-party cloud services in the U.S. Our European websites are hosted on third-party cloud computing services near each of London, England and Dublin, Ireland. We use third-party content distribution networks to cache and serve many portions of our sites at locations across the globe. We monitor and test at the application, host, network, and full site levels to maintain availability and promote performance. We use third-party cloud computing services for many data processing jobs and backup/recovery services.
Intellectual Property
 We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade secret protections, confidentiality procedures, and contractual restrictions.
 We have one issued U.S. patent with an expiration date of May 2034, two pending U.S. patent applications, and two pending international patent applications. These applications cover proprietary technology that relates to various functionalities on our platform, generally in connection with pricing, ranking and detecting fraud in online listings. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial to our competitive position.
 We have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks, including “CarGurus,” the CarGurus logo, the CG logo, and related marks, which we have registered as trademarks in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions. We pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe doing so would be beneficial to our competitive position. Additionally, CarOffer has a number of registered and unregistered trademarks, including “CarOffer” and the CarOffer logo, and related marks, which CarOffer has registered as trademarks in the U.S. CarOffer pursues additional trademark registrations to the extent it believes doing so would be beneficial to its competitive position. Our and CarOffer’s registered trademarks remain enforceable in the countries in which they are registered for as long as we and CarOffer, as applicable, continue to use the marks, and pay the fees to maintain the registrations, in those countries.
 We are the registered holder of several domestic and international domain names that include “CarGurus” and variations of our trade names.

In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees and relevant consultants, contractors, and business partners. We control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in contracts with our customers and partners and our general and product-specific terms of use on our websites.
 Regulatory
 Various aspects of our business are, may become, or may be viewed by regulators from time to time as subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. In particular, the advertising and sale of new or used motor vehicles is highly regulated by the states and jurisdictions in which we do business. Although we do not sell motor vehicles and we believe that vehicle listings on our sites are not themselves advertisements, regulatory authorities or third parties could take the position that some of the laws or regulations applicable to dealers or to the manner in which motor vehicles are advertised and sold generally are directly applicable to our business. These advertising laws and regulations, which often originated decades before the emergence of the internet, are frequently subject to multiple interpretations, are not uniform across jurisdictions, sometimes impose inconsistent requirements with respect to new or used motor vehicles, and the manner in which they should be applied to our business model is not always clear. Regulators or other third parties could take, and on some occasions have taken, the position that our marketplace or related products violate applicable brokering, birddog, consumer protection, or advertising laws or regulations.
 Our wholesale operations through CarOffer are regulated by the states in which we operate and by the U.S. federal government. These activities may also be subject to state and local licensing requirements. Additionally, we may be subject to regulation by individual state dealer licensing authorities and state consumer protection agencies.
 In order to operate in this regulated environment, we develop our products and services with a view toward appropriately managing the risk that our regulatory compliance, or the regulatory compliance of the dealers whose inventory is listed on our websites, could be challenged.
 We consider applicable advertising and consumer protection laws and regulations in designing our products and services. With respect to paid advertising, other than Featured Listings, Featured Priority Listings and products marketed under our RPM digital advertising suite, we believe that most of the content displayed on the websites we operate does not constitute paid advertising for the sale of motor vehicles. Nevertheless, we endeavor to design our website content in a manner that would comply with relevant advertising regulations and consumer protection laws if, and to the extent that, the content is considered to be vehicle sales advertising.
 Our websites and mobile applications enable us, dealers, and users to send and receive text messages and other mobile phone communications, which requires us to comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, in the U.S. The TCPA, as interpreted and implemented by the Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC, and federal and state courts, imposes significant restrictions on utilization of telephone calls and text messages to residential and mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, particularly when the prior express consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained.
In addition, we are subject to numerous federal, national, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States and around the world regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use, cross-border transfer, and protection of personal information and other data. While the scope of these laws and regulations is changing and remains subject to differing interpretations, we seek to comply with industry standards and all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations, and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. We are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties.
