ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Historical Development 
 
On February 27, 1986, PCT LTD, formerly known as Bingham Canyon Corporation (“PCTL”), was incorporated in the State of Delaware as Hystar Aerospace Marketing Corporation of Delaware (“Hystar-Delaware”) and was a subsidiary of Nautilus Entertainment, Inc., (now called VIP Worldnet, Inc.), a Nevada corporation. Hystar-Delaware completed a change of domicile merger on August 26, 1999 with then named Bingham Canyon Corporation, now named PCT LTD, a Nevada corporation.
 
On August 31, 2016, PCTL (then known as Bingham Canyon Corporation) entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Paradigm Convergence Technologies Corporation, a Nevada corporation (“PCT Corp.”). Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, PCT Corp. became the wholly-owned subsidiary of PCTL after the exchange transaction. PCTL is a holding company which, through PCT Corp., is engaged in the business of marketing new products and technologies through licensing and joint ventures.
 
PCTL and PCT Corp. are located in Little River, SC. PCT Corp. was formed June 6, 2012 under the name of EUR-ECA, Ltd. which was changed in September 2015 to PCT Corp.
 
Business Strategy – Operating Subsidiaries
 
PCT Corp.


PCTL focuses its business on acquiring, developing and providing sustainable, environmentally safe disinfecting, cleaning and tracking technologies. The Company acquires and holds rights to innovative products and technologies, which are commercialized through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary, PCT Corp. PCT Corp. is a technology development, design, assembly and manufacturing company specializing in providing cleaning/sanitizing/disinfectant fluid solutions and fluid-generating equipment that create environmentally safe solutions for global sustainability. PCT Corp. markets new products and technologies for the healthcare, agriculture, oil and gas and other industries through multiyear system and service contracts that provide equipment and support for our customers.
 
The Company holds and defends its patents, trademarks, intellectual property and distribution rights to its innovative products and technologies. While a direct-sales capability is in place and will continue to be expanded, it is not PCT Corp.’s intent to be the sole distributor of its proprietary products. Members of PCT Corp.’s management also act in supportive roles for the development of distributors and manufacturers’ representatives who are involved in selling its products. In addition to the direct sales program, senior management is responsible for continuing to develop the distribution and licensing program operations for the technology, to develop new opportunities and applications for the products and to promote the brands. PCT Corp.’s senior management intends to also continue the pursuit of new technologies – particularly technologies which are complementary to or enhance applications opportunities for its existing products - upon which it will build and expand its business.
 
PCT Corp. has developed several models of electrochemical activation generators and systems for the production of Hydrolyte®, an EPA registered, highly effective sanitizer/disinfectant microbiocide that is environmentally responsible and for use around humans and animals. Hydrolyte® has been market tested with commercial customers and is now fully launched into the hospital and healthcare market. Management intends to focus on leveraging the opportunities presented by Hydrolyte® during 2021within the healthcare market, as well as building into its oil and gas and agriculture markets.

PCT Corp.’s revenue streams have in the past been derived primarily from master service contracts, placing its Annihilyzer Infection Control Systems and other models of its equipment into clients’ locations and benefitting from recurring monthly revenue for typically 3- to 5-year contract periods, as well as licensing and distributor agreements, along with some outright sales of equipment. PCT Corp. made a “soft” launch in 2017, and management focused on establishing distributor operations and direct sales in addition to expanding its equipment production capabilities. Direct sales of equipment and Hydrolyte® have been managed by members of the senior management team. During 2019, PCT Corp. added additional distributors and supplemental EPA registrants (licenses), in addition to building on existing distributors that have existing healthcare, and other industry, customer relationships. The prior years’ distributors were based in New Jersey/New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Florida. As a result of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic’s onset in March of 2020, PCT Corp. found itself unable to travel to install Annihilyzer Infection Control Systems into healthcare settings; so, management decided to upfit its Little River, SC facility to produce significantly increased fluid production capacity to 10,000 gallons a day to serve healthcare facilities’ and others’ critical needs for a hospital level, US EPA-registered disinfectant. During 2020, PCT Corp.’s distribution network was vastly expanded throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico, as well as into the United Kingdom. A distributor-focused website was launched (www.pctcorporation.com) to build the company’s Hydrolyte® brand and promote fluid sales. Management expects to continue vetting and adding more strategically located and specific industry-focused distributors and is in negotiations with several potential entities for certain market segments.
 
In building out our production capabilities, PCT Corp. developed strategic operating relationships with firms that are leaders in production, manufacturing and distribution within the various industries where the markets for our technologies exist. Management believes that this strategy, properly executed, should allow for the most rapid possible rollout of the products and solid capture of market share.
 
Disruptive Oil and Gas Technologies Corp
 
On July 11, 2021, we incorporated a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Disruptive Oil and Gas Technologies Corp (“Disruptive O&G”), in the State of Nevada. Disruptive O&G was formed to allow us flexibility in operations dealing with the oil and gas industry. As at December 31, 2021, Disruptive O&G had not commenced operations.
 
In October of 2021, we entered into a contribution agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) among Nano Gas Technologies, Inc. (“Nano Gas”), NGT Energy Inc, Pentagon Technical Services, Inc. (“Pentagon”) and Disruptive O&G. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Nano Gas assigned a patent, titled “Nanobubble Dispersions in Electrochemically Activated Solutions”, to Disruptive O&G in return for a 46.25% ownership interest in the entity and Pentagon was issued a 7.5% ownership interest in the entity for services. A copy of the Contribution Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.7.
 
Technologies Development Corp
 
On July 11, 2021, we incorporated a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Technologies Development Corp (“TDC”), in the State of Nevada. TDC was formed in anticipation of expanding our operations through the development of additional technologies, joint venturing with industry partners or other purposes as determined by management. As of December 31, 2021, TDC was inactive; however, subsequent to year-end, TDC has located a company with unique technology and is in discussions to structure a potential transaction in the second quarter of 2022. 
Principal Technology: Hydrolyte® and PCT Catholyte
 
Paradigm’s generator systems make two products in the cleansers, hard-surface sanitizers, and disinfectants categories:
 
 | Hydrolyte® US EPA Registration No. 92108-1 is a highly effective hard-surface sanitizer and/or disinfectant with the lowest EPA toxicity rating possible (“4”); and, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | PCT Catholyte, a similarly safe, mild detergent, degreaser and surfactant that is easily applied using mop buckets, sprayers and floor cleaning machines for basic janitorial cleaning purposes. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both products are outputs of a single process of electrochemical activation (“ECA”) generation process using the Company’s technology and input ingredients derived from naturally occurring salt minerals and water. Commercially, the primary product is Hydrolyte®, and the second product of the process, Catholyte, is a very useful and effective product for which parallel markets exist and profitable revenue streams are being developed.
 
The company had two registrations of Hydrolyte® with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) during 2019 but retained only the most valuable Registration (92108-1) at the end of 2019, having sold the duplicate registration to a third-party entity. Hypochlorous acid- (HOCl-) based solutions such as Hydrolyte® are approved for specific uses and with specific directions by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for cleaning and sanitizing applications and by the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) for use in food processing. These “approvals” are covered in various Federal Codes. 
 
Although it has been well known for many years that an aqueous solution of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), branded by the Company as “Hydrolyte®”, (commonly called “anolyte”) can deliver extremely effective decontamination and disinfectant results, previous challenges in the production technology had rendered its use economically infeasible in most applications. The primary drawbacks with previous anolyte production technology were: 1) the inability to generate anolyte in high enough concentrations (Parts Per Million – PPM) of the active ingredient, HOCL; 2) high enough commercial volumes from the generators (as opposed to 1 quart to 1 gallon, small volume batch or low flow generators); 3) reliability of the generators or fluids; and, 4) the relatively short time that the product maintained its maximum decontaminative efficacy (“shelf life”) and consistency.
 
By nature, Hydrolyte® is a metastable, aqueous solution of hypochlorous acid generated through the ECA process. It has a high redox potential (900 millivolts) and a greater biocidal effect than chlorine and other toxic chemicals. Hydrolyte® is 99.5% water + salt rendering it of less concern to humans; yet, it is effective against the various classes of pathogens comprising bacteria, viruses, spores and yeast. Organisms in these categories include C. diff, TB, Parvovirus. Norovirus, Listeria, E. Coli, HIV, Hepatitis C, Influenza A, Candida and antibiotic-resistant strains such as MRSA, VRE and CRE. Using Hydrolyte® in decontamination and sterilization processes generally eliminates the need for the use of other highly toxic chemical biocides (such as ammonia, chlorine bleach and glutaraldehyde) which are commonly used in sanitizing, disinfection and decontamination. On March 31, 2020, we became sanctioned to use the US EPA’s “emerging viral pathogens claim” which assisted our commercialization efforts to provide Hydrolyte® to many distributors.
 
This Company’s proprietary production, distribution and applications technologies have solved these problems. Its production equipment allows the Hydrolyte® solution to be produced consistently with specific, predetermined concentration of HOCl within the range of concentrations typically employed (50 to 600 PPM) as well as the desired pH level (the pH scale measures how acidic or Alkaline a substance is) that may be desirable for any given application. To resolve the maintenance of efficacy issue, PCT Corp. has perfected generation (production) equipment which is small enough to be located on the customer’s facility, allowing for production-on-demand rather than maintaining stored product inventory. For customers who will not use enough product to justify the on-site equipment, the company intends to engage industry-specific distribution and commercial services companies to provide the products to end-user customers on a regular delivery schedule. The combination of the on-site generation and delivery solutions should assure end-users will always be supplied with fresh, full-strength product.

Production: 
 
Hydrolyte® is generated with the Company’s proprietary equipment. The production technology for Hydrolyte® generates a product with predetermined PPM and pH properties, i.e., the equipment can be calibrated to deliver any desired PPM level; and we believe it is superior to any other known production process or equipment available in the market today. The scalable Hydrolyte® generation systems technology largely will be housed in portable and mobile units, which can be readily moved within a building or from site to site, although more permanent installations, probably employing larger generation systems, will be made in situations where such installation is appropriate or required. The Company’s models of Hydrolyte® generator equipment is classified, dependent upon configuration and volume of output:

 | Annihilyzer Infection Control System – Hospital/Healthcare 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | Annihilyzer Infection Control System – Rack Model 
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | Hydrolyte Generator – Large and Medium Volume 
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | SurvivaLyte Manual Generator – Small Volume 
--+------------------------------------------------


 | Annihilyzer Hospital 360 SMART Spray Cart 
--+----------------------------------------------


 | School/Hospitality Industry and General Business 360 SMART Utility Cart 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Other models and newer generations of the Annihilyzer® Infection Control System and Hydrolyte® generating equipment are in research and development.
 
Markets: 
 
The primary applications for the Hydrolyte® technology are in cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting in a variety of market sectors and settings, including:
 

 | Institutional facilities, such as hospitals, nursing homes, hotels, correctional facilities and schools; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The agriculture industry for pre- and post-harvest disinfection of crops, sanitization in food processing, and certain applications in animal husbandry; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The oil and gas industry where Hydrolyte® can provide a process to disinfect water used in hydraulic fracking processes (“frac water”) and to kill sulfate reducing bacteria in “sour” oil and gas wells; and Catholyte can be used to clean equipment and aid in product recovery when applied “down hole”; and. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Other potential market opportunities are available, e.g., disinfecting and sanitizing of water in public and private water systems and industrial waste-water systems. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Management determined that the most direct paths to rapid revenue and earnings growth are in the institutional facilities and agriculture markets, although the agricultural market presents some EPA-related barriers. The preponderance of business development and marketing resources are currently being devoted to these two markets. Management intends to also work to maintain our position and expertise in the oil and gas industry to assure that current customer relationships are maintained, business opportunities at hand are pursued and that we are properly positioned for a roll-out as, and when, drilling activity increases as anticipated. As further market development occurs, the Company anticipates considering and acting upon factual information.

Institutional Facilities: Hospitals, Health Care Facilities and Schools
 
PCT Corp.’s senior research and development personnel have developed several models of equipment to be deployed as a state-of-the-art integrated product dispensing, tracking (patented RFID tracking features) and management systems for applications in the institutional facilities market. This integrated technologies solution, branded as PCT’s Annihilyzer® Infection Control System, has been designed most particularly for hospitals, large long-term care, assisted living and nursing home facilities. In various configurations (utilizing a rack model) it in can be deployed in other health care facilities including urgent care centers, medical, dental and veterinary offices. It is adaptable to deployment in schools, prisons, hotels, and many other facilities, although the primary marketing and sales goal for PCT Corp. remains with the hospital market. A complete and custom turn-key cleaning and disinfection program solution can be provided to each facility.


At the physical core of the Annihilyzer® System is PCT Corp.’s on-site generation equipment, housed in the Annihilyzer® Filling Station (the Hydrolyte® generating portion of the equipment), also containing the Company’s patented tracking system, managed disbursement and bottling system for fluid production, containerization and use. Spray bottles and other containers are labeled when filled or refilled with product identification and date of production using printed labels and radio-frequency identification (“RFID”) tags. Reading these labels and tags before use assures that the correct and “fresh” product is always being used. Each room is also given an RFID tag. By reading the RFID room tags with a mobile app in a Mobile Data Terminal (ruggedized smartphone), the system tracks what is cleaned and disinfected, when, with what product, and by whom. The station is Wi-Fi connected to smartphones, so it can receive and store all of the data collected. The data can be used to generate a complete record of all cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing activity, including personnel time and task data – a cost saving convenience to management.
 
The Company created and offers a proprietary automated state-of-the-art Electrostatic Spray Cart for use in hospital (or hospitality-industry) settings, allowing for rapid disinfecting of rooms once a patient (guest) has vacated the room. This system is designed to reduce the turnover time required between patients/guests, potentially increasing revenue opportunities, and improving efficiency of hospital/hotel personnel. A smaller scaled model of the electrostatic spray cart is available to other industries, such as hotels, transportation, schools, and other businesses.
 
PCT Corp. deploys its on-site production equipment under service contracts, charging an installation and set-up fee followed by monthly contract fees (some pricing models may include, or may be based on, a price per gallon of product used), over a contract period of approximately 3 – 5 years. The equipment is deployed and maintained through PCT Corp.’s personnel at first, then through specially-trained distributors. The Company is exploring the use of licensed commercial services companies to provide the future on-site support, as required. The product generators and other components of the on-site systems are currently monitored remotely by a PCT Corp. equipment specialist(s), but we are considering contracting with a monitoring company that is highly experienced and provides round the clock expertise in remote monitoring and response systems. The precise nature of any functional problems that may occur with any of the system’s components are, in most cases, automatically communicated via the internet to the monitoring and control center of the equipment. Any problem is then resolved through a three-tiered problem response system: first by remote access to the computerized system controls, second by an on-site technician call, and third through a “rapid replacement” program. If problems are not resolved by the first or second tier responses, then PCT Corp. would overnight ship replacement parts or, if necessary, a complete station or system and have the defective unit returned for repair.
  
Agricultural Antimicrobial Pesticide
 
In the agricultural sector our microbicide is branded as “Hydrolyte® Green.” Our testing and field trials continue to indicate that it can provide pre-harvest disinfection and decontamination solutions for any number of field crops that are affected by various bacterial and fungal pathogens. Through USDA grants and multiple studies by universities around the world, hypochlorous acid solutions have been tested and proven effective in post-harvest applications to include sanitizing at point of harvest, point of packing, and points of sale.

While Hydrolyte Green® is effective in these post-harvest applications, the Company’s major objective is to deliver solutions for pre-harvest pathogen contaminations, where a multitude of microbial infestations of many crops still need effective solutions that will qualify for regulatory approvals necessary to bring the treatment solution into commercial use. PCT Corp.’s agricultural research program continued throughout 2019 and is intended to support a continuous rollout of scientifically tested and certified applications for the treatment and prevention of numerous specific microbial infestations of a wide variety of crops. This research activity is expected to capture the test data required for regulatory approvals, and market acceptance of, the specific uses for the specific crops. During 2018, we executed a distribution and license agreement with an agricultural chemical specialty company and are actively involved in additional field trials of Hydrolyte Green®. The US EPA product registration “system” has presented the Company with challenges that have yet to be overcome so that commercial entry in this industry may move forward. For this reason, PCT Corp.’s prior agricultural-focused distributor allowed its distribution and license agreement to lapse after October 1, 2019, having paid the Company $100,000 for the 1-year rights associated with the agreement.


While company management, technical staff and consultants are certain of the ability of Hydrolyte® to mitigate most microbes; further testing and documentation are required to determine optimal protocols for treatment, including application concentrations, volumes, and frequency, as well as optimal delivery techniques (which could be any or all of: root drenching, foliar spray or injection) needed to produce the most effective and least costly solutions to microbial infestations. It must also be demonstrated and certified by independent third-party testing that the treatment does no harm to the plants or the crops to be harvested and leaves no chemical residual inside the crop.
 
PCT Corp. undertook a long-term testing and field trial program with an independent agricultural pesticide research firm to determine the feasibility of pre-harvest use of Hydrolyte® to treat various microbial infestations in as many different crops as possible. The research in this field continues, to-date. Management has identified several microbial crop infestation problems for which safe and effective treatment solutions have yet to be found and for which there is preliminary evidence that a properly researched Hydrolyte® treatment protocol could provide such a solution. Management anticipates positive results from independent testing leading to the creation, over time, of multiple business opportunity targets on which to build a solid consistent, long-term revenue stream with solid growth potential for the foreseeable future.
 
Testing/Research: 
 
Six years ago (2015), an opportunity was identified for research into a possibly significant opportunity for commercialization of a formulation of the Company’s Hydrolyte® product. A critical agricultural market was seeking solutions to eradicate a serious and threatening microbial infestation. The company’s management determined that our product’s microbicide capability could provide a readily deployable and effective solution to the problem. Three months (late 2015 and early 2016) were spent determining the research requirements, target-market requirements and the potential for successful commercialization in the identified market. Two seasoned professionals with the necessary expertise were brought on board, and the project was launched from the Company’s facility in Little River, South Carolina, during the fourth quarter of 2015.
 
To demonstrate that the Company could provide a viable solution, research protocols were developed, and a series of laboratory tests and preliminary trials were performed at a major university by agricultural scientists who were experts on the crop and the infestation. The results of these tests and the trial analysis were very favorable, showing a >97% percent kill rate on the treated microbes in the laboratory and a >88% kill rate in the field trial environment.
 
Encouraged by early laboratory and field trial results, management secured the services of a consulting specialist in the target crop and the microbial pathogen causing the disease. Working with the consultant, management determined the market to be viable for the use of the Company’s Hydrolyte® in effectively treating the disease.

The second field trial, for nine months during 2016, was extensive and involved a larger-scale operation over a greater length of time. Specific third-party reports to the company indicated “good to excellent control of the disease source, economically feasible, EPA registration possible” and a continuing very high field kill rate. Upon receiving these results, the Company began developing plans to make certain it will be prepared to “supply fluid product in commercial quantities.”
 
Preventive, curative and health maintenance programs for the application of the Company’s Hydrolyte® were discussed and developed, with input and encouragement by the fruit’s national growing association, as well as from nationally recognized educational and research institutions.
  
In March 2017, the Company began a much larger-scale field trial of our product on a 20-acre plot that has trees showing widespread presence of the disease. We, and our consulting specialist, expect to replicate and to validate previous results and further define the best possible methodology and protocols for effective application of the Hydrolyte® solution. Because the results of the trial were positive, as expected, management continued to expand its commercial field trial usage of Hydrolyte Green ® with its agriculture distributor and licensee and is gaining valuable research data to be used in further commercialization efforts:
 

 | Finalize regulatory approvals to enter the market as the only known resource for resolving this agricultural disease with no known negative effects to the fruit; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Finalize designs for, and assemble, large volume product generation and delivery systems best suited to the agricultural working environment; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Pursue additional EPA approvals for additional applications in the agricultural markets; and, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Forecast, with greater accuracy, product deployment protocols through research and development input for use in the distribution and sales of product in this market. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Although regulatory agency progress within this market was much slower than expected during 2020 due at least in part to the pandemic and certain financial constraints, the Company continues its field trials and compiling documented results.
 
Oil and Gas Industry
 
World market prices for oil have fluctuated during the past several years. As opportunities in this market emerge, we plan to use oil-field service companies to market and distribute our Hydrolyte® and Catholyte products to their clients/customers. Management incorporated Disruptive O&G to address this market and anticipates the Contribution Agreement with Nano Gas will enhance our presence and success in the industry.
 
Management believes that the benefits of our proven technologies continue to be desirable for, and should continue to be used in, hydraulic fracturing drilling worldwide. Some of the benefits of our products and systems include: elimination of highly toxic chemicals currently used for decontamination, reduced negative environmental impact, reduced recovery costs, improved product quality, and potentially opening new areas for oil and gas retrieval. As a result, management is preparing for expanding business opportunities in this sector in the mid-term future. As part of this preparation, Paradigm is developing a large-scale system utilizing Hydrolyte® to decontaminate water and fluid going “down hole” in oil and gas-well drilling; and to decontaminate recovered “frac” water for reuse in the fracking process. Operational experience has shown that Hydrolyte® not only effectively decontaminates the water supply of microbes, but also does not cause corrosive damage to gas and oil recovery equipment; nor does it cause any loss of performance to the other chemicals, additives, and propellants currently used in drilling and fracking processes.

Hydrolyte® also addresses another problem in the oil and gas industry. In a separate application, Hydrolyte® can be used to reduce the sulfur content of crude oil in the ground. There are sulfite-producing microbes in crude oil which cause higher levels of hydrogen sulfide (“H2S”) and “sour” wells with sour crude oil which is less valuable than “sweet” crude which has low H2S. It has been demonstrated that Hydrolyte® is effective in reducing or eliminating these microbes, thus improving the quality and value of the oil recovered from the treated well.
 
Hydrolyte® can reduce the costs of transporting contaminated water from the wellbore to a treatment facility and back for reuse, thus reducing the need for construction of water processing capacity, providing a substantial reduction in the costs of drilling, and enabling a sustainable increase in efficiency. The Company intends to maintain an active marketing program; and expects that there will be renewed opportunities for revenue growth from the frac drilling and related oil-field applications.
 
In 2019 we put in place a commercial collaboration agreement and sold additional Hydrolyte® large volume equipment with a distributor located in Meeker, Oklahoma. Collaboration in oilfield/gas industry testing, along with preliminary conversations and observations about the Cannabis market, regarding models of delivery of the fluids to the oil and gas market. During 2020, we engaged the consulting services of Pentagon Technical Services led by David Holcomb, PhD, a renowned oil and gas industry expert. Building on laboratory testing, Dr. Holcomb guided the development of protocols for a three- to four-month in-field testing program of PCT Catholyte and other additives to enhance oil production in wells. The in-field testing project was initiated utilizing six (6) test wells in the Grassy Creek oil field located in Deerfield, MO. Four weeks were spent establishing a baseline of oil production from each well. Initial test results were very encouraging, so the Company determined it needed to further explore the oil to water ratio results in the test wells. Recently, it was concluded that three of the six wells were so damaged that it was unlikely there would be any positive results from the PCT Catholyte treatments. The damage to the wells was due to previous recovery efforts that utilized a super-heated steam process that increased the number of fractures, which, when combined with the viscosity of oil (16°), created a prohibitive situation wherein primarily waters would “go through.” We continue to perform testing on the remaining three wells and are encouraged by the increasing ratio of oil to water.
 
Marketing, Sales and Distribution of Hydrolyte®
 
Once again, marketing and sales activities were nominal in the first half of 2021 while management focused on adapting its business model to meet the climate created by the worldwide pandemic. A good portion of 2021 was spent building sufficient physical production capacity to meet demand, while developing work flows, shipper relationships and accounting systems to serve fluids customers instead of assembling equipment. New distributor and customer relationships were established through management’s existing contacts and as a result of much of the business world seeking an effective disinfectant to protest themselves during the unprecedented pandemic event. Management, working with consultants well-known to management, continues to establish distributor and/or joint venture opportunities and other agreements for the marketing and sales of PCT Corp.’s products and services.
 
The Company began updating marketing materials and websites in order to present a consistent brand identity.
 
PCT Corp. uses its production, operations and research and development facility in Little River, South Carolina to display its products and technologies, to produce fluids for shipment, and also established a fluid production depot in Fort Wayne, Indiana during 2020, and is considering strategic assembly capabilities for this facility. The Little River location provides a meeting and demonstration area where working models and simulations allow first-hand interaction and live demonstrations for interested parties. Little River hosts on-site visits for training, as well as allowing for research and development to freely occur in a controlled environment.
 
The Institutional program for PCT Corp.’s healthcare sales program began with agreements with prospective customers for pilot/demonstration installations at their facilities; those pilot installations were completed early in 2019 and the Company has completely moved away from “trial” installations in the healthcare industry, as pre-contract trial periods are no longer necessary.

Production, Assembly and Principal Suppliers 
 
Hydrolyte® Generation and Equipment Production:
 
PCT Corp. moved into its operations, research and development and production facility in Little River, South Carolina on December 15, 2016. The research, development and testing spaces were suitable and functional as already built. A new design and layout for a final systems assembly area and an expanded testing area was finalized in January 2018. Since 2019, PCT Corp. has designed and built the following Hydrolyte® generating systems in the Little River facility:

 | Annihilyzer Infection Control System – Hospital/Healthcare 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | Annihilyzer Infection Control System – Rack Model 
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | Hydrolyte Generator – Large and Medium Volume 
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | SurvivaLyte Manual Generator – Small Volume 
--+------------------------------------------------


 | Annihilyzer Hospital 360 Electrostatic SMART Spray Cart 
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | School/Hospitality Industry and General Business Electrostatic 360 SMART Spray Cart 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Annihilyzer® Systems Assembly:
 
Annihilyzer generator systems are assembled and tested in Little River and the other outsourced components for the Annihilyzer® Infection Control Systems are shipped to Werks Manufacturing Inc., in Ft. Wayne, Indiana for final assembly of the Annihilyzer® Kiosk and Filling Station cabinet. The Kiosks, Filling Stations and the 360 Electrostatic Spray Carts are fabricated by Werks, where PCT LTD’s patented RFID technology is inserted, as well.
Competition 
 
In all our target markets, PCT Corp. will compete directly with large firms selling competing, but toxic, traditional cleanser and disinfectant products that are manufactured off-site and shipped to customers or distributors. These competitors have longer operating histories, more experience, substantially greater financial and human resources, greater size, more substantial research and development and marketing operations, established distribution channels and are well positioned in the market to fight aggressively to defend their market share. However, the combined markets in which PCT Corp. is engaged are so massive that its competitive position as environmentally-responsible and, growing numbers of installations in various markets, combined with being less expensive, are allowing PCT Corp. to prosper. The Company’s on-site generation technology provides a substantial competitive advantage in addition to its unique properties.
 
There are a limited number of potential competitors providing some form of anolyte-based biocide. Based on management’s research these companies are largely in early operating stages, concentrated in local or regional markets and have no technology or pricing advantage. These include Aquaox, Ecologic Solutions, and MIOX Corporation. During 2020, several new HOCl-focused companies have entered the market, but we find that the competitors are oftentimes not producing the same, consistent, 500 ppm, near-neutral pH fluid solutions or that they may be altering the fluid to increase “shelf-life,” which changes the chemical composition of the HOCl. The markets for HOCl (Hydrolyte®) are so vast, that we believe that credible competitors will positively impact our growth.
 

13
--

 
In institutional facilities and agricultural industries, PCT Corp. believes that its proprietary integrated technologies solutions in production, distribution, applications management and tracking will continue to provide a competitive advantage in direct competition with other HOCl-producers. In the oil and gas industry PCT Corp. has demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiencies of its Hydrolyte® and continues to develop commercial market data and test results to further promote the use of PCT Catholyte and processes and commercial acceptance from its customers. It is well positioned with respect to other companies providing anolyte-based biocides.
 
Intellectual Property
 
EPA product registrations of disinfectants and pesticides allow the registered products to be sold and distributed with labels identifying specific laboratory tested and proven kill claims of its effectiveness against specific microbial pathogens. Below is a summary of recent EPA registrations, EPA sub-registrations and other intellectual property the Company has acquired. The Company continues to hold certain intellectual properties relative to the Soloplax biodegradable plastics technology but does not anticipate pursuing commercialization of the technology associated in the foreseeable future.
 
On December 15, 2016, Paradigm acquired an EPA sub-registration (#82341-1-92108), which provides for entry into the facilities and agricultural markets described previously in this document. The company is actively pursuing sales under this registration and label. In addition, the Company has registered its products in several states, under its US EPA No. 92108-1.
 
On March 13, 2017, the Company entered into a Registration Transfer Agreement (“Transfer Agreement”) and a Data License and Assignment Agreement (“Data Agreement”) with a third party. Pursuant to the Transfer Agreement, the Company received United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) Registration number 82341-4 for Excelyte® VET for a one-time fee of $125,000.
 
On April 6, 2017, Paradigm, acquired the complete intellectual property, including know-how, trade secrets and patent rights to the hardware, firmware and software comprising the product inventory generation, disbursement, containerization, tracking and reporting system, trademarked as the Annihilyzer® System. The Annihilyzer® System is designed to be employed on-site in healthcare facilities. The company already owns IP rights in the generation system employed in this integrated technology system.
 
The Company has developed proprietary know-how related to the electrolytic cells and systems that generate our Hydrolyte® and Catholyte products. Paradigm continues, through its research and development program, to perfect the production innovation, know-how, trade secrets and patentable innovations incorporated into the improved production, inventory management and reporting systems. Current focus is on customizing system and equipment design to suite the production parameters and conditions in various specific venues and applications, e.g., agricultural field setting vs. packing house or oil and gas field.
 
On April 12, 2018 the Company entered into an agreement to purchase the original US EPA Registration No. 83241-1 for EcaFlo® Anolyte. The Company paid a $5,000 deposit on the agreement with the remaining balance due in increments during the second quarter of 2018 to finalize the agreement. The Company continued to make installment payments to complete the purchase of this label and, during 2019, sold the rights to this registration to a third-party for a price that included the remaining portion of the registration that PCTL had not yet paid to the owner, thus completing the transaction and conveying the registration to the new owner.

Research and Development is an ongoing process to develop new and more functional designs for our equipment, specifically Annihilyzer® and “rack model,” high-volume equipment.
 
Several years ago, PCT Corp. entered into an agreement with Florida Pesticide Research, Inc. to conduct agricultural research intended to support an aggressive rollout of tested and certified applications for the treatment and prevention of numerous specific microbial infestations of a wide variety of crops. While company management, technical staff and consultants are confident of Hydrolyte® Green’s ability to kill many damaging microbe, further testing and testing validation is required to determine proper application concentrations, volumes, frequency and delivery techniques (which could be any or all of: root drenching, foliar spray or injection) needed to be most effective and least costly. It also must be demonstrated that the treatment does no harm to the plants or the product to be harvested and that no harmful residual remains in the crop because of the treatment. Management continues to maintain and expand the testing and demonstration program currently in place over to other crops, as well as to target various additional crop infestation problems for the foreseeable future.
 
Government Regulations and Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
PCTL is not aware of any existing or probable government regulations that would negatively impact our operations, other than requiring additional time for US EPA protocol approval in the agricultural market. As a licensor of water treatment technology, the Company is not subject to government regulations for the removal of oils, solids and pathogens from water, other than normal safety standards and certifications (such as UL or CE) for goods that we manufacture for demonstrations and joint ventures, and our product lines. However, prospective customers are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations governing water quality, environmental quality and pollution control. To date, compliance with government regulations has had no material effect on the company’s operations, capital, earnings, or competitive position, and the cost of such compliance has not been material. The Company is unable to assess or predict at this time what effect additional regulations or legislation could have on its activities.
 
In addition, PCT Corp.’s prospective customers will be subject to the Clean Water Act which regulates the discharge of pollutants into streams and other waters of the U.S. (as defined in the statute) from a variety of sources. If wastewater or runoff from facilities or operations may be discharged into surface waters, the Clean Water Act requires that person to apply for and obtain discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring and, under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges. The federal government may delegate Clean Water Act authority to the states.
 
Employees
 
At the end of 2021, PCT Corp. had sixteen (16) full-time employees, two (2) part-time employees, and contract consultants who were engaged on a regular basis. Management confers with outside expert consultants, attorneys and accountants as necessary. The company anticipates engaging additional full-time employees in 2022.
