Item 1. Business
Introduction 
 Overview
 Federal Life Group, Inc. (“FLG”, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) provides life insurance and annuity products targeted to the middle American market. Industry data indicates there is a substantial unmet need for life insurance and investment and retirement products, particularly among domestic households with annual incomes of between $60,000 and $250,000, a market we refer to as the Middle Market. We believe that approximately 45 million households comprise our target market — households with identified need for life insurance and guaranteed retirement income products and the financial means to address that need. We strive to deliver to our target market affordable, easy to understand life insurance and annuity products through knowledgeable independent agents.
 We have not been profitable in recent years due to the prolonged low interest rate environment, which has depressed interest income, insufficient size to absorb our fixed costs, changing niche markets, and insufficient capital to support a growing book of business. To address some of these shortcomings, we have identified variable and fixed annuities, and certain life and supplemental health products, as niche markets that provide opportunities to partner with distribution partners to leverage available capacity of the Company’s infrastructure. Proceeds from the initial public offering (“IPO”), discussed below, have strengthened the Company’s balance sheet and will generate additional investment income. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had total consolidated revenue of $20.8 million, insurance revenues of $11.3 million, and a net loss of $4.8 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had over 26,000 policyholders and group certificate holders, almost 2,000 annuity contractholders, total assets of $279.7 million, and equity of $52.9 million. 
 Corporate Structure
 FLG is a Pennsylvania corporation organized to be the stock holding company for Federal Life Mutual Holding Company and its subsidiaries (the “Predecessor”) following the conversion of Federal Life Mutual Holding Company from mutual to stock form (the “Conversion”). Federal Life Mutual Holding Company was subsequently renamed Federal Life Holding Company after the Conversion. Prior to the Conversion, FLG was not engaged in any significant operations and did not have any assets or liabilities. After the Conversion, which was completed on December 11, 2018, when FLG issued 3,530,150 shares at $10.00 per share for gross proceeds of $35.3 million, FLG’s primary assets are the outstanding capital stock of the Predecessor and a portion of the net proceeds of the Company’s IPO, which was completed on December 11, 2018. Prior to the Conversion, FLG was a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Predecessor. Following the Conversion, the Company reorganized its corporate structure so that the Predecessor is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of FLG and its accounts are consolidated with those of FLG within the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 We now conduct our business through our primary operating subsidiary, Federal Life Insurance Company (“Federal Life”), an Illinois-domiciled life insurance company that was incorporated in 1899. Federal Life distributes its life insurance and annuity products through independent agents and is licensed in the District of Columbia and every state except Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont. Federal Life is located in Riverwoods, Illinois.
 Federal Life has two wholly-owned non-insurance subsidiaries: Americana Realty Company (“Americana”) and FED Mutual Financial Services, Inc. Americana owns mineral rights in Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma and Texas. Americana earns royalty revenues from energy producers that are under agreement to drill for and produce oil and gas products on properties where Americana owns mineral rights. FED Mutual Financial Services, Inc. is a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) licensed broker/dealer that was established to distribute variable annuity products for Federal Life.

Market and Opportunities 
 Market for Life Insurance Products
 We believe that the conditions for increasing sales of life insurance in the Middle Market are favorable. Recent reports from the Life Insurance Market Research Association (“LIMRA”), a worldwide research, learning, and development organization serving the financial services industry, indicate that significant unmet demand exists in this market, with less than half of Middle Market consumers having individual life insurance coverage. We believe that the financial implications for Middle Market households are profound and that consumers are aware of the need for coverage.
 The three largest living generations, often referred to as Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials, are at a life stage that aligns well with mortality protection products. According to the Pew Research Center, approximately 10,000 Americans turn age 65 every day — a trend that is projected to continue until 2030. We believe that significant growth potential exists for life insurance sales by companies that position themselves to satisfy the unmet need among this large, growing segment of the U.S. population.
 Market for Annuity Products
 Our target market includes the group of individuals who are seeking to accumulate tax deferred savings or create guaranteed lifetime income. We believe that significant growth opportunities exist for annuity products because of favorable demographic and economic trends. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were approximately 39 million Americans age 65 and older in 2010, representing 13% of the U.S. population, and this group had grown to 44.7 million in 2013. By 2030, this sector of the population is expected to increase to 20% of the total population. Our fixed index and fixed rate annuity products are particularly attractive to this group due to their principal protection, competitive rates of credited interest, tax deferred growth, guaranteed lifetime income, and alternative payout options. Our competitive fixed annuity products have enjoyed favorable sales growth in recent years.
 The additional capital from the IPO has provided the capital needed to support our growing index annuity business and allows us to re-enter the variable annuity market. 
 Strategy
 Key elements of executing our strategy include the following: 
 Enter into Strategic Partnerships to Expand our Sales and Distribution. We currently distribute our life insurance and annuity products through approximately 1,000 independent agents. We intend to expand our distribution platform by entering into strategic partnerships with companies that can broaden our distribution channels. We believe that our controlling shareholders, Insurance Capital Group, LLC (“ICG”) can also provide assistance in expanding our distribution network. 
 Pursue Acquisitions of Life Companies and Related Businesses. We intend to use the additional capital provided by the Company’s IPO to explore possible acquisitions of other life insurance companies to grow our business and leverage our existing available administrative capacity. We will also explore opportunities to acquire related businesses, such as insurance agencies, that can expand our distribution network.
 Continue to Introduce Innovative and Competitive Products. We intend to be innovative within the fixed index and fixed rate annuity industry in developing and introducing new and competitive products. We offer a fixed index annuity that provides the consumer with a choice among interest crediting strategies including both equity indexes as well as a traditional fixed rate strategy. We include a lifetime income benefit rider with our fixed index annuities. We also intend to introduce a new variable annuity product in 2019. We believe that our continued focus on anticipating and being responsive to the product needs of the ever-growing population of retirees will lead to increased customer loyalty, revenues, and profitability.
 Target Niche Markets for Our Products. We intend to focus on niche markets for our products, such as the Hispanic market, the direct-to-consumer market, and the senior and retirement planning markets. Federal Life currently has a presence in the Hispanic market and maintains an entirely separate Spanish-language website (mifederallife.com) that features content and themes unique to that target market. Federal Life is also committing substantial resources to upgrade its digital platform and intends to leverage these new digital distribution and service applications to meet the needs of today’s consumers by promoting ease of access to information and efficient sales and customer service. We intend to target the senior and retirement planning markets with our existing fixed index annuity, flexible premium deferred annuity, and final expense plan insurance products.

Target Digital Transformation. We are committing substantial resources to upgrade our digital platform to provide digital distribution and sales applications to meet the demands of today’s consumers by promoting ease of access to information and efficiency between sales and customer service. This permits us to generate more business from new and existing customers. 
 Focus on Profitability and Improve Operating Efficiency. We are committed to improving our profitability by advancing the scope and sophistication of our investment management and spread capabilities and by continuously seeking efficiencies within our operations. The expanded use of technological resources will continue to allow us to improve our processes, scalability, and response times.
 Focus on High Quality Service to Agents and Policyholders. We have maintained high quality personal service as one of our highest priorities since the inception of our company and continue to strive for an unprecedented level of timely and accurate service to both our independent agents and policyholders. We believe high quality service is one of our strongest competitive advantages.
Products
 The Company provides life insurance and annuity products targeted to middle class America. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had insurance revenues of $11.3 million and $12.1 million, respectively, and annuity deposits of $9.2 million and $13.0 million, respectively. 
Life Insurance
 The various life insurance products that we offer are briefly described below: 
  
• | Single Premium Whole Life — we offer single premium whole life policies, which require payment of a single premium of at least $5,000 and provide cash surrender values based on the contractual rate of interest. These policies may be surrendered for their cash surrender value at any time. Single premium policies are mainly issued in connection with the insured’s estate planning and the insured must be between the ages of 40 and 85 at the time the policy is issued.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Interest Sensitive Life — we offer interest sensitive life policies, which are a hybrid of whole life and universal life. Interest sensitive policies have fixed premiums, death benefits, and minimum cash surrender values, but also have an account value to which net premiums and interest are added, and from which insurance and expense charges and surrender charges are deducted, which may result in a higher cash surrender value. The credited interest rate is declared by us and may be changed at any time but is subject to a minimum interest rate. The insured must be no older than age 70 when the policy is issued, and the minimum policy amount is $5,000.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Term Life — we offer term life insurance policies with fixed premiums for 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. The minimum policy amount is $50,000, and the insured may not exceed 70 years of age at the date the policy is issued.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Universal Life — we offer a universal life policy that permits the amount of the coverage and related premium amount under the policy to be adjusted from time to time by the holder. Under a universal life policy, interest earned on the policy is credited to the policy’s cash surrender value at a rate we declare, which may not be below the minimum guaranteed interest rate. Universal life policies may be surrendered for their cash surrender value at any time. For universal life policies, the minimum policy amount is $25,000 and the insured may not exceed 70 years of age at the date the policy is issued.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Final Expense Benefit — we offer two types of final expense benefit life insurance policies – fixed and graded. Under the fixed benefit policy, the beneficiary receives a fixed amount upon the insured’s death. Under the graded life policy, the amount paid to the beneficiary upon the insured’s death depends on the period of time between the date the policy is issued and the date of the insured’s death. If the insured dies within the first year after the policy is issued, the beneficiary receives 120% of the amount of the premium paid. If the insured dies in the second year after the policy is issued, the beneficiary receives 140% of the amount of the premium paid. Policies are available from $2,500 to $25,000 in death benefits, and the insured may not exceed 80 years of age at the date the policy is issued.

Annuities
 Annuities offer our policyholders a tax-deferred means of accumulating retirement savings, as well as a reliable source of income during the payout period. When our policyholders deposit cash to annuities, we account for these receipts as policy deposits in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheet. The annuity deposits we have collected, by product type, during the two most recent fiscal years are as follows:

 | For Year Ended December 31, | 
--------------------------------------+-----------------------------+------
 | 2018 | | 2017 
 | Deposits | | Deposits as | | Deposits | | Deposits as 
Product Type | Collected | | a % of Total | | Collected | | a % of Total
 | (Dollars in thousands) | 
Fixed index annuities | $ | 7,904 | | 86 | % | $ | 11,349 | 87 | %
Single premium fixed rate annuities | | 189 | | 2 | % | | 231 | 2 | %
Flexible premium fixed rate annuities | | 488 | | 5 | % | | 716 | 6 | %
Single premium immediate annuities | | 648 | | 7 | % | | 672 | 5 | %
 | $ | 9,229 | | 100 | % | $ | 12,968 | 100 | %

Fixed Index Annuities
 Fixed index annuities allow contractholders to earn index credits based on the performance of a particular index, such as the S&P 500 index, without the risk of loss of their principal. Most of these products allow contractholders to transfer funds once a year among several different crediting strategies, including one or more index-based strategies and a traditional fixed rate strategy. Our fixed index annuity policy includes a “premium bonus” that increases the initial annuity deposit at issuance by a specified percentage, ranging from 1% to 12%. Generally, the surrender charge and bonus vesting provisions of our annuity policies are structured such that we have comparable protection from early termination between bonus and non-bonus products.
 The annuity contract value is equal to the single premium paid, the premium bonus, and interest credited, adjusted for any partial surrenders. “Interest credited” includes index credits for funds allocated to an index-based strategy, which either applies a percentage limit (or “cap”) to the annual index increase or uses a percentage (“participation rate”) of the index increase when calculating the interest rate to be applied to indexed funds. Caps and participation rates limit the amount of annual interest the policyholder may earn in any one index period and may be adjusted by us each index period subject to certain limits. The cap may not be less than 1% and the participation rate can range from 10% to 75%. Minimum guaranteed surrender values are equal to no less than 87.5% of the single premium plus interest credited at an annual rate ranging from 1% to 3%.
 Fixed Rate Annuities
 Fixed rate deferred annuities include annual and multi-year rate guaranteed products. After the first policy year, we have the discretionary ability to change the crediting rate once at any time to any rate at or above a guaranteed minimum rate. Our flexible premium deferred annuities allow us to change the interest rate credited at our discretion to any rate at or above a guaranteed minimum rate. Our multi-year rate guaranteed annuities guarantee the initial crediting rate for up to 7 years before we can change the rate credited at our discretion. Customers can purchase a fixed rate annuity at any time.
 The initial crediting rate is largely a function of the interest rate we can earn on invested assets acquired with new annuity deposits and the rates offered on similar products by our competitors. For subsequent adjustments to crediting rates, we take into account the yield on our investment portfolio, annuity surrender and withdrawal assumptions, and crediting rate history for particular groups of annuity policies with similar characteristics. As of December 31, 2018, crediting rates on our outstanding fixed rate deferred annuities generally ranged from 1.35% to 6.00%. The average crediting rates on our outstanding guaranteed fixed rate deferred annuities at December 31, 2018 were 3.31%.
 Single Premium Immediate Annuities
 We also sell single premium immediate annuities (“SPIAs”). Our SPIAs are designed to provide a series of periodic payments for a fixed period of time or for life, according to the policyholder’s choice at the time of issue. The amounts, frequency and length of time of the payments are fixed at the outset of the annuity contract. SPIAs are often purchased by persons at or near retirement age who desire a steady stream of payments over a future period of years. The implicit interest rate on SPIAs is based on market conditions when the policy is issued. The implicit interest rate on our outstanding SPIAs averaged 2.46% at December 31, 2018.

Withdrawal Options – Fixed Index and Fixed Rate Annuities
 Policyholders are typically permitted penalty free withdrawals up to 10% of the contract value in each year after the first year, subject to limitations. Withdrawals in excess of allowable penalty-free amounts are assessed a surrender charge during a penalty period which ranges from 1 to 10 years for fixed index annuities and 5 to 15 years for fixed rate annuities from the date the policy is issued. This surrender charge initially ranges from 0.9% to 9% for fixed index annuities and 1% to 7% for fixed rate annuities of the contract value and generally decreases by approximately one half to two percentage points per year during the surrender charge period. For certain policies, the premium bonus is considered in the establishment of the surrender charge percentages. For other policies, there is a vesting schedule ranging from 10 to 14 years that applies to the premium bonus and any interest earned on that premium bonus. Surrender charges and bonus vesting are set at levels aimed at protecting us from loss on early terminations and reducing the likelihood of policyholders terminating their policies during periods of increasing interest rates. This practice enhances our ability to maintain profitability on such policies. Policyholders may elect to take the proceeds of the annuity either in a single payment or in a series of payments for life, for a fixed number of years or a combination of these payment options. Information on surrender charge protection and net account values for the previous two fiscal years is below:

 | For the Year Ended December 31, | 
-----------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+-------
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | 
 | (Dollars in thousands) | 
Annuity Surrender Charges: | $ | 3,440 | | | $ | 2,666 | 
Average years at issue | | 8 | | | | 8 | 
Average years remaining | | 4 | | | | 4 | 
Average surrender charge percentage remaining | | 5.16 | % | | | 4.42 | %
Annuity of account value (net of coinsurance) | $ | 66,605 | | | $ | 60,257 | 

 
Since 2015, 57% of our fixed index annuity policies were issued with a lifetime income benefit rider. This rider provides an additional liquidity option to policyholders. With the lifetime income benefit rider, a policyholder can elect to receive guaranteed payments for life from his contract without requiring the policyholder to annuitize the contract value. The amount of the living income benefit available is determined by the growth in the policy’s income account value as defined in the rider (3.0% to 8.0%), which is selected by the policyholder at the time of purchase, and the policyholder’s age at the time the policyholder elects to begin receiving living income benefit payments. Lifetime income benefit payments may be stopped and restarted at the election of the policyholder. Rider fees range from 0.75% to 0.95% of the policy’s income account value.
 Variable Annuities 
 A variable deferred annuity is a financial product designed for long-term investment purposes, such as retirement. This annuity is a contractual agreement between the contract owner and the company that stipulates the company will pay an income to the contract owner in the future in exchange for an upfront premium payment.
 As a deferred annuity, the contract is comprised of two phases: the accumulation phase and the income phase. The accumulation phase begins upon purchase. During this phase, the single premium or multiple premium payments earn interest on a tax-deferred basis. As a variable annuity, the contractholder selects how the premium will be allocated to the various investment choices made available by the contract. Interest credited during the accumulation phase will depend on the portfolio performance of the selected investment allocation(s). Additionally, a death benefit is provided to the contract beneficiary during this phase.
 When the contract owner decides to annuitize the contract (i.e. begin receiving income payments), the income phase begins. There are several payment methods available, including fixed and variable. Fixed payments will remain level, while variable payments will fluctuate depending on the investment performance of the portfolios selected.
 While we do not currently offer variable annuities, we intend to introduce a variable annuity product to our group of product offerings in 2019. The additional capital from the IPO completed in December 2018 has provided the capital needed to support our growing index annuity business and allow us to re-enter the variable annuity market during the 2019 fiscal year. Federal Life was a pioneer in the variable annuity market and introduced one of the first variable annuity products in 1975 when Federal Life Variable Annuity Account – A was established. The separate account is registered with the SEC as a unit investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Federal Life continues to administer this business which is segregated from the Company’s general account assets.

Investments/Spread Management
 Investment activities are an integral part of our business, and net investment income is a significant component of our total revenues. Profitability of our annuity products is significantly affected by spreads between interest yields on investments, the cost of options to fund the annual index credits on our fixed index annuities, and rates credited on our fixed rate annuities. We manage the index-based risk component of our fixed index annuities by purchasing call options and call option spreads on the applicable indices to fund the annual index credits on these annuities and by adjusting the caps and participation rates on index dates to reflect the change in the cost of such options, which varies based on market conditions. All options are purchased near the respective anniversary dates in which the earnings from the annuity contract are determined based on the chosen index, and new options are purchased on each of the anniversary dates to fund the next annual index credits. All credited rates may be changed annually, subject to minimum guarantees. Changes in caps, participation rates, and crediting rates on fixed rate and fixed index annuities may not be sufficient to maintain targeted investment spreads in all economic and market environments. In addition, competition and other factors, including the potential for increases in surrenders and withdrawals, may limit our ability to adjust or to maintain caps, participation rates, asset fees, and crediting rates at levels necessary to avoid narrowing of spreads under certain market conditions.
 For additional information regarding the composition of our investment portfolio and our interest rate risk management, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Financial Condition — Investments” and Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements.
 Marketing/Distribution
 We market our products through a network of independent agents located in the 45 states in which we are licensed to issue insurance. We emphasize high quality service to our agents and policyholders along with the prompt payment of commissions to our agents. We believe this has been significant in building excellent relationships with our distribution network.
 Our independent agents and agencies range in profile from national sales organizations to personal producing general agents. We actively recruit new agents and terminate those agents who have not produced business for us in recent periods and are unlikely to sell our products in the future. In our recruitment efforts, we emphasize that agents have direct access to our executive officers, giving us an edge in recruiting over larger and foreign owned competitors. We also emphasize our products and service and our focused fixed rate and fixed index annuity expertise.
 The independent agent distribution system is comprised of insurance brokers and agents. We are pursuing a strategy to increase the efficiency of our independent agent distribution network by strengthening our relationships with our existing agents while we remain alert for opportunities to establish relationships with organizations not presently associated with us. We generally do not enter into exclusive arrangements with our agents.
 Five of the agents contracted with us each accounted for more than 5.0% of the annuity deposits and insurance premiums collected during 2018 by Federal Life. The states with the largest share of direct premium collected during 2018 were: Illinois (39%), Florida (13%), California (9%), Ohio (6%), and Texas (6%).
 We will seek to expand distribution of our products by establishing relationships with additional distribution partners.
 Product Pricing
 We regularly review claim results for each of our products, comparing actual experience to the assumptions used to design and price the products. Our actuarial and finance teams perform the review process with assistance from the underwriting and operations team, product development team, and marketing. Variances in our expectations for particular products are examined for implications on product performance and used to evaluate product prices and underwriting assumptions. Our reinsurance partners also review product experience.
 Key elements of our product pricing include assumptions regarding future mortality (amount and timing of future benefit payments), persistency experience (number and timing of policyholder discontinuations or coverage lapses), and investment returns (interest we will earn on investment of free cash flows and reserves).
 8


Competition 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our annuity products compete with fixed index, fixed rate, and variable annuities sold by other insurance companies and also with mutual fund products, traditional bank products and other investment and retirement funding alternatives offered by asset managers, banks, and broker/dealers. Our insurance products compete with products of other insurance companies, financial intermediaries, and other institutions based on a number of features, including crediting rates, index options, policy terms and conditions, service provided to distribution channels and policyholders, ratings, reputation, and distributor compensation.
Ratings
 Financial strength ratings generally involve quantitative and qualitative evaluations by rating agencies of a company’s financial condition and operating performance. Generally, rating agencies base their ratings upon information furnished to them by the insurer and upon their own investigations, studies and assumptions. Ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders, agents, and intermediaries, are not directed toward the protection of investors, and are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities.
 Agents selling life insurance and annuity products use the ratings assigned to an insurer by independent rating agencies as one factor in determining which insurer’s products to offer to a customer. Federal Life has not sought a rating from A.M. Best Company since 1993 and does not intend to seek a rating in 2019 but may seek a rating from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization in future years. The degree to which the lack of a rating has affected and will affect Federal Life’s sales and persistency is unknown.
 Reinsurance
 We follow the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our life insurance risks with unaffiliated reinsurers. Our reinsurance agreements play a part in managing our regulatory capital.
 Consistent with the general practice of the life insurance industry, Federal Life enters into agreements of indemnity reinsurance with other insurance companies in order to reinsure portions of the coverage provided by its annuity and life insurance products. Indemnity reinsurance agreements are intended to limit a life insurer’s maximum loss on a large or unusually hazardous risk or to diversify its risks. Indemnity reinsurance does not discharge the original insurer’s primary liability to the insured.
 We reinsure 80% of our term and flexible premium universal life net amount at risk. In addition, the maximum loss retained by us on any one life is $250,000 as of December 31, 2018. All of Federal Life’s new business on these plans is reinsured under a life reinsurance agreement with Optimum Re.
 Even though we reinsure certain of our liabilities to third party reinsurance carriers, Federal Life remains directly liable to policyholders for the benefit payments associated with these policies. Our reinsurance carriers have a contractual relationship with Federal Life to reimburse us for policy claims but are not under any contractual obligation to our policyholders. Because Federal Life remains directly liable to policyholders for the full amount of the death benefits payable under its policies, Federal Life bears credit risk relating to its reinsurers under its reinsurance contracts. As a result, Federal Life will only enter into a reinsurance agreement with reinsurers that have stable operating performance, including a minimum A.M. Best financial strength rating of “A-” (Excellent). We believe the assuming companies will be able to honor all contractual commitments, based on our periodic review of their financial statements, insurance industry reports and reports filed with state insurance departments.
 The following table sets forth our reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2018, and the A.M. Best ratings of those reinsurers as of that date:

Investments
 We had total cash and investment assets of $233.5 million as of December 31, 2018. All invested assets are managed pursuant to an investment plan developed by our executive management team and approved by and reviewed annually with our board of directors. The board of directors approves all changes to the investment plan.
 We have contracted with a third-party investment advisory firm to provide portfolio management and consulting services to assist our chief financial officer with the oversight of various portfolios. Our investment advisor meets periodically, but not less frequently than quarterly, with our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer to review portfolio results and discuss portfolio strategies.
 Our investment strategy is to diversify among asset classes and individual issuers to achieve appropriate matching of assets with insurance liabilities, sufficient liquidity, and predictability of income. The composition of our investment portfolio is primarily investment grade fixed income investments and is managed with primary emphasis on current earnings and safety of principal. 
 The following table shows the allocation of our invested assets as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Fixed maturities, available for sale, at fair value | $ | 184,475

Total cash and investments | $ | 233,514

Enterprise Risk Management
 The review and assessment of enterprise risks is the responsibility of our executive management team with oversight provided by the board of directors through its audit committee. We have established risk management policies and procedures throughout our organization. To supervise the implementation of these risk management policies and procedures, we have engaged outside consultants on this topic and have established a risk management committee that consists of members of our senior management team.
 We have launched a multi-phase risk assessment project focused on formalizing our enterprise risk management process covering our operations and all corporate activities. Project goals include defining key risks and risk events, establishing corporate risk tolerances, and documenting the accountability for the risk management processes. Work is in process to formalize and in some cases develop additional measurements related to enterprise level risks for management and board reporting. The risk assessment project will continue to evolve with the business over the near term and result in the development of more formalized enterprise risk management capabilities.
 To limit its exposure in the event of a lawsuit, Federal Life maintains a full line of insurance coverages, including errors and omissions, directors and officers liability, and cyber liability insurance.
 Regulation 
 Our businesses are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover Federal Life’s operations as a life insurance company and FED Mutual Financial Services, Inc.’s operations as a FINRA licensed broker dealer. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and governmental regulations, including administrative determinations, court decisions, and similar constraints. The purpose of the laws and regulations affecting our operations is primarily to protect our policyholders and not our shareholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. State insurance laws regulate most aspects of our insurance business, and we are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which we sell insurance policies. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) assists the various state insurance regulators in the development, review, and implementation of a wide range of financial and other regulations over the insurance industry.

Insurance Regulation
 Federal Life is licensed to transact business in all states and jurisdictions in which it conducts an insurance business. Federal Life is an Illinois domiciled life insurance company licensed to transact business in 45 states and the District of Columbia. Federal Life is not licensed to transact business in New York, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, or Vermont. State insurance laws regulate many aspects of our business. Such regulation is vested primarily in state agencies having broad administrative and in some instances discretionary power dealing with many aspects of our business, which may include, among other things, required reserve liability levels, permitted classes of investments, transactions among affiliates, marketing practices, advertising, privacy, policy forms, reinsurance reserve requirements, acquisitions, mergers, and capital adequacy, and is concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders and other consumers rather than shareholders. We are subject to financial and market conduct examinations by insurance regulators from our domiciliary states and from other states in which we do business.
 State laws and regulations governing the financial condition of insurers apply to Federal Life, including standards of solvency, risk-based capital requirements, types, quality and concentration of investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, required methods of accounting, reinsurance and minimum capital and surplus requirements, and the business conduct of insurers, including sales and marketing practices, claim procedures and practices, and policy form content. In addition, state insurance laws require licensing of insurers and their agents. State insurance regulators have the power to grant, suspend, and revoke licenses to transact business and to impose substantial fines and other penalties.
 Agent Licensing
 Federal Life sells its insurance products through independent distributors. The states in which insurance agents operate require agents to obtain and maintain licenses to sell insurance products. In order to sell insurance products, the agents must be licensed by their resident state and by any other state in which they do business and must comply with regulations regarding licensing, sales and marketing practices, premium collection and safeguarding, and other market conduct practices. In addition, in most states, Federal Life must appoint the agents and agencies that sell our insurance products, and the agents must be appointed by all carriers for which they sell.
 Consistent with various federal and state legal requirements, we monitor our agents that sell for Federal Life, and we monitor the agencies with which the independent distributors and independent agents work in order to understand and evaluate the agencies’ training and general supervision programs relevant to regulatory compliance.
 Financial Review
 Federal Life is required to file detailed annual and quarterly financial reports with the insurance departments in the states in which we do business, and its business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time. These examinations generally are conducted under NAIC guidelines. Under the rules of these jurisdictions, insurance companies are examined periodically (generally every three to five years) by one or more of the supervisory agencies on behalf of the states in which they do business.
Market Conduct Regulation
 The laws and regulations governing our insurance businesses include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers, such as Federal Life, including regulations governing the form and content of disclosures to consumers, advertising, product replacement, sales and underwriting practices, complaint handling, and claims handling. State insurance regulators enforce compliance, in part, through periodic market conduct examinations.
Insurance Holding Company Regulation
 All states in which Federal Life conducts insurance business have enacted legislation that requires each insurance company in a holding company system to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its state of domicile and to furnish that regulatory authority financial and other information concerning the operations of, and the interrelationships and transactions among, companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management, or financial condition of the insurers within the system. These laws and regulations also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents and affiliates. Generally, these laws and regulations require that all transactions within a holding company system between an insurer and its affiliates be fair and reasonable and that the insurer’s statutory surplus following any transaction with an affiliate be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. Statutory surplus is the excess of admitted assets over statutory liabilities. For certain types of agreements and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates, these laws and regulations require prior notification to, and non-disapproval or approval by, the insurance regulatory authority of the insurer’s state of domicile. These laws and regulations also require the holding company system to file an annual report identifying certain risks (“enterprise risks”) that, if not remedied, are likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition of the insurer or its holding company system as a whole.

Dividend Limitations
 As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, Federal Life Group, Inc. will depend on intercompany dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries as the principal source of cash to meet its obligations. The ability of Federal Life to pay dividends to its corporate parent is limited under Illinois law. Such dividends may only be paid out of earned surplus (excluding unrealized capital gains), and no dividend may be paid that would reduce Federal Life’s statutory surplus to less than the amount required to be maintained by Illinois law for the types of business transacted by Federal Life. All intercompany dividends must be reported to the Illinois Department of Insurance prior to payment. In addition, Federal Life may not pay an “extraordinary” dividend or distribution until 30 days after the Illinois Director of Insurance has received sufficient notice of the intended payment and has not objected or has approved the payment within the 30-day period. An “extraordinary” dividend or distribution is defined under Illinois law as a dividend or distribution that, together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of:

• | 10% of the insurer’s statutory surplus as of the immediately prior year end; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the statutory basis net income of the insurer for the prior year.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2019, extraordinary dividends would be any dividend over $2.5 million.
 Change of Control
 Illinois law requires advance approval by the Director of Insurance of any direct or indirect change of control of an Illinois domiciled insurer, such as Federal Life. In considering an application to acquire control of an insurer, the Director generally will consider such factors as experience, competence, and the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity of the applicant’s board of directors and officers, the acquirer’s plans for the management and operation of the insurer, and any anti-competitive effects that may result from the acquisition. Under Illinois law, there exists a presumption of “control” when an acquiring party acquires 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company or of a company which itself controls an insurance company. Therefore, any person acquiring, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of our common stock would need the prior approval of the Illinois Director of Insurance, or a determination from the Director that “control” has not been acquired. Under Section 59.1(6)(i) of the Illinois Insurance Code, no person, together with such purchaser’s associates or a group acting in concert, may acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the capital stock of Federal Life Group, Inc. for a period of five years from the effective date of the Conversion (December 11, 2018) without the approval of the Illinois Director of Insurance.
 In addition, a person seeking to acquire, directly or indirectly, control of an insurance company is required in some states to make filings prior to completing an acquisition if the acquirer and the target insurance company and their affiliates have sufficiently large market shares in particular lines of insurance in those states. Approval of an acquisition may not be required in these states, but the state insurance departments could take action to impose conditions on an acquisition that could delay or prevent its consummation.
 Policy and Contract Reserve Sufficiency
 Federal Life is required under Illinois law to conduct annual analyses of the sufficiency of its life insurance and annuity statutory reserves. In addition, other states in which Federal Life is licensed may have certain reserve requirements that differ from those of Illinois. In each case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion each year that states that the aggregate statutory reserves, when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such reserves, make good and sufficient provision for the associated contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer. If such an opinion cannot be provided, the affected insurer must set up additional reserves by moving funds from surplus. Federal Life submitted these opinions without qualification as of December 31, 2018 to applicable insurance regulatory authorities.

Risk Based Capital (“RBC”) Requirements
 The NAIC has established a standard for assessing the solvency of insurance companies using a formula for determining each insurer’s RBC. The RBC model act provides that life insurance companies must submit an annual RBC report to state regulators reporting their RBC based upon four categories of risk: asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, and business risk. For each category, the capital requirement is determined by applying factors to various asset, premium, and reserve items, with the factor being higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items. The formula is intended to be used by insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify possible weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action. If an insurer’s Total Adjusted Capital (“TAC”) falls below specified levels in relation to its RBC, the insurer would be subject to different degrees of regulatory action depending upon the relationship of its TAC to its RBC. These actions range from requiring the insurer to propose actions to correct the capital deficiency to placing the insurer under regulatory control. For example, if Federal Life’s TAC is equal to or less than its “company action level RBC,” then Federal Life could be subject to a wide range of regulatory oversight, including a requirement to submit a written plan for capital strengthening to the Illinois Director of Insurance. A company’s “company action level RBC” is equal to two times its “authorized control level RBC,” which is the product of the RBC formula as described above. Federal Life’s “authorized control level RBC” was $2.95 million, which results in a “company action level RBC” of $5.9 million. At December 31, 2018, Federal Life’s TAC of $27.3 million was significantly in excess of its “company action level RBC,” by $21.4 million. Our other operating subsidiaries and Federal Life Holding Company are not subject to RBC requirements.
 Following the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), the NAIC adopted revisions to certain factors used to calculate Life RBC, which is the denominator of the RBC ratio. These revisions to the NAIC’s Life RBC calculation have resulted in increases in our RBC charges. The NAIC is also studying RBC revisions for bonds, real estate, and longevity risk, but it is premature to project the impact of any potential regulatory changes resulting from such proposals. 
 The NAIC is continuing to develop a group capital calculation tool using an RBC aggregation methodology for all entities within the insurance holding company system. The goal is to provide U.S. regulators with a method to aggregate the available capital and the minimum capital of each entity in a group in a way that applies to all groups regardless of their structure. The NAIC expects to conduct field testing in the first half of 2019. The NAIC has stated that the calculation will be a regulatory tool and will not constitute a requirement or standard. Nonetheless, any new group capital calculation methodology may incorporate existing RBC concepts. It is not possible to predict what impact any such regulatory tool may have on our risk-based capital ratios.
 NAIC Ratios
 The NAIC is a voluntary association of state insurance commissioners formed to discuss issues and formulate policy with respect to regulation, reporting, and accounting of insurance companies. Although the NAIC has no legislative authority and insurance companies are at all times subject to the laws of their respective domiciliary states, and to a lesser extent, other states in which they conduct business, the NAIC is influential in determining the form in which such laws are enacted. Model insurance laws, regulations, and guidelines have been promulgated by the NAIC as minimum standards by which state regulatory systems and regulations are measured.
 The NAIC also has established a set of 13 financial ratios to assess the financial strength of insurance companies. The key financial ratios of the NAIC’s Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, which were developed to assist insurance departments in overseeing the financial condition of insurance companies, are reviewed by experienced financial examiners of the NAIC and state insurance departments to select those companies that merit highest priority in the allocation of the regulators’ resources. IRIS identifies these key financial ratios and specifies a range of “unusual values” for each ratio. The NAIC suggests that insurance companies that fall outside the “usual” range in four or more financial ratios are those most likely to require analysis by state regulators. However, according to the NAIC, it may not be unusual for a financially sound company to have several ratios outside the “usual” range. For the year ended December 31, 2018, some of Federal Life’s ratios were outside the “usual” range, but the Company does not expect this trend to continue.

Statutory Accounting Principles (“SAP”)
 SAP is a basis of accounting developed by U.S. insurance regulators to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurance companies. In developing SAP, insurance regulators were primarily concerned with evaluating an insurer’s ability to pay all its current and future obligations to policyholders. As a result, statutory accounting focuses on conservatively valuing the assets and liabilities of insurers, generally in accordance with standards specified by the insurer’s domiciliary jurisdiction. Uniform statutory accounting practices are established by the NAIC and generally adopted by regulators in the various U.S. jurisdictions. These accounting principles differ somewhat from GAAP, which are designed to measure a business on a going concern basis. GAAP gives consideration to matching of revenue and expenses and, as a result, certain insurer expenses are capitalized when incurred and then amortized over the life of the associated policies. The valuation of assets and liabilities under GAAP is based in part upon best estimate assumptions made by the insurer. Shareholders’ equity under GAAP represents both amounts currently available and amounts expected to emerge over the life of the business. As a result, the values for assets, liabilities, and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP may be different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under SAP.
 State insurance laws and regulations require Federal Life to file with state insurance departments publicly available quarterly and annual financial statements, prepared in accordance with statutory guidelines that generally follow NAIC uniform standards. State insurance laws require that the annual statutory financial statements be audited by an independent public accountant and that the audited statements be filed with the insurance departments in states where the insurer transacts business.
 State Insurance Guaranty Funds Laws
 In most states, there is a requirement that life insurers doing business within the state participate in a guaranty association, which is organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent, or failed insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the written premium in the state by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent, or failed insurer is engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover such paid assessments through full or partial premium tax offsets.
 Life insurance company insolvencies or failures may result in additional guaranty association assessments against Federal Life in the future. At this time, we are not aware of any material liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that apply to Federal Life with respect to impaired or insolvent insurers that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings.
 Regulation of Investments
 Federal Life is subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of its investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed income securities, equity real estate, mortgages, other equity investments, foreign investments, and derivatives. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus, and, in most instances, require divestiture.
Federal and State Legislative and Regulatory Changes
 From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed for the insurance industry. Among the proposals that have in the past been or are at present being considered are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current system of state regulation of insurers and proposals in various state legislatures (some of which proposals have been enacted) to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the NAIC. We are unable to predict whether any of these proposed laws and regulations will be adopted, the form in which any such laws and regulations would be adopted or the effect, if any, these developments would have on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Federal Income Tax
 The annuity and life insurance products that we market generally provide the policyholder with a federal income tax advantage, as compared to certain other savings investments such as certificates of deposit and taxable bonds, in that federal income taxation on any increases in the contract values (i.e., the “inside build up”) of these products is deferred until it is received by the policyholder. With other savings investments, the increase in value is generally taxed each year as it is realized. Additionally, life insurance death benefits are generally exempt from income tax.
 14


From time to time, various tax law changes have been proposed that could have an adverse effect on our business, including the elimination of all or a portion of the income tax advantage described above for annuities and life insurance. If legislation were enacted to eliminate the tax deferral for annuities, such a change would have an adverse effect on our ability to sell non-qualified annuities. Non-qualified annuities are annuities that are not sold to an individual retirement account or other qualified retirement plan.
 Since 2013, distributions from non-qualified annuity policies are considered “investment income” for purposes of the Medicare tax on investment income contained in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. As a result, in certain circumstances a 3.8% tax (“Medicare Tax”) may be applied to some or the entire taxable portion of distributions from non-qualified annuities to individuals whose income exceeds certain threshold amounts. This tax may have an adverse effect on our ability to sell non-qualified annuities to individuals whose income exceeds these threshold amounts.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, Federal Life had 62 employees, 50 of which were full-time. We provide health, dental, disability, vision, and life insurance to our full-time employees who have completed 90 days of full-time employment. Full time employees are also eligible for paid vacation and to participate in the Federal Life 401-(k) plan, which features a 50% company match of each employee’s voluntary contribution to the plan up to 6% of the employee’s compensation. We have the option to make an additional profit-sharing contribution of up to 3% of the employee’s compensation to the plan. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
