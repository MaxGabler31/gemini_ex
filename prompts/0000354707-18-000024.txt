ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

HEI Consolidated
HEI and subsidiaries and lines of business.  HEI was incorporated in 1981 under the laws of the State of Hawaii and is a holding company with its principal subsidiaries engaged in electric utility and banking businesses operating primarily in the State of Hawaii. HEI’s predecessor, Hawaiian Electric, was incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Hawaii (now the State of Hawaii) on October 13, 1891. As a result of a 1983 corporate reorganization, Hawaiian Electric became an HEI subsidiary and common shareholders of Hawaiian Electric became common shareholders of HEI.
Hawaiian Electric and its operating utility subsidiaries, Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc. (Hawaii Electric Light) and Maui Electric Company, Limited (Maui Electric), are regulated electric public utilities. Hawaiian Electric also owns all the common securities of HECO Capital Trust III (a Delaware statutory trust), which was formed to effect the issuance of $50 million of cumulative quarterly income preferred securities in 2004, for the benefit of Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric. In December 2002, Hawaiian Electric formed a subsidiary, Renewable Hawaii, Inc., to invest in renewable energy projects, but it has made no investments and currently is inactive. In September 2007, Hawaiian Electric formed another subsidiary, Uluwehiokama Biofuels Corp. (UBC), to invest in a biodiesel refining plant to be built on the island of Maui, which project has been terminated.
Besides Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries, HEI also currently owns directly or indirectly the following subsidiaries:  ASB Hawaii, Inc. (ASB Hawaii) (a holding company, formerly known as American Savings Holdings, Inc.) and its subsidiary, American Savings Bank, F.S.B. (ASB); HEI Properties, Inc. (HEIPI), which was dissolved on December 11, 2015 and wound up in June 2017; The Old Oahu Tug Service, Inc. (TOOTS); and Pacific Current, LLC, and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.
ASB, acquired by HEI in 1988, is one of the largest financial institutions in the State of Hawaii with assets of $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2017.
TOOTS administers certain employee and retiree-related benefit programs and monitors matters related to its predecessor’s former maritime freight transportation operations.
In September 2017, HEI formed new 100% owned subsidiaries—Pacific Current, LLC and its subsidiary Hamakua Holdings, LLC and its subsidiary, Hamakua Energy, LLC. On November 24, 2017, Hamakua Energy, LLC acquired Hamakua Energy Partners, L.P.’s 60-megawatt combined cycle power plant and other assets from affiliates of ArcLight Capital Partners, a private equity firm focused on energy infrastructure investments. The plant sells power to Hawaii Electric Light under an existing power purchase agreement (PPA) that expires in 2030.
In November 2017, HEI formed new 100% owned subsidiaries—Mauo Holdings, LLC (a 100% owned subsidiary of Pacific Current, LLC) and its subsidiary, Mauo, LLC. See Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Termination of proposed Merger. For information concerning the termination of HEI's Merger Agreement with NextEra Energy, Inc., see Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Additional information.  For additional information about HEI, see HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and HEI’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including the Notes thereto.

Regulation.  HEI and Hawaiian Electric are each holding companies within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and implementing regulations, which requires holding companies and their subsidiaries to grant the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) access to books and records relating to FERC’s jurisdictional rates. FERC granted HEI and Hawaiian Electric a waiver from its record retention, accounting and reporting requirements, effective May 2006.
HEI is subject to an agreement entered into with the PUC (the PUC Agreement) which, among other things, requires PUC approval of any change in control of HEI. The PUC Agreement also requires HEI to provide the PUC with periodic financial information and other reports concerning intercompany transactions and other matters. It also prohibits the electric utilities from loaning funds to HEI or its nonutility subsidiaries and from redeeming common stock of the electric utility subsidiaries without PUC approval. Further, the PUC could limit the ability of the electric utility subsidiaries to pay dividends on their common stock. See “Restrictions on dividends and other distributions” and “Electric utility—Regulation” below.
HEI and ASB Hawaii are subject to Federal Reserve Board (FRB) regulation, supervision and reporting requirements as savings and loan holding companies. As a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, supervision and regulation of HEI and ASB Hawaii, as thrift holding companies, moved to the FRB, and supervision and regulation of ASB, as a federally chartered savings bank, moved to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in July 2011. In the event the OCC has reasonable cause to believe that any activity of HEI or ASB Hawaii constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of ASB, the OCC is authorized to impose certain restrictions on HEI, ASB Hawaii and/or any of their subsidiaries. Possible restrictions include precluding or limiting: (i) the payment of dividends by ASB; (ii) transactions between ASB, HEI or ASB Hawaii, and their subsidiaries or affiliates; and (iii) any activities of ASB that might expose ASB to the liabilities of HEI and/or ASB Hawaii and their other affiliates. See “Restrictions on dividends and other distributions” below.
Bank regulations generally prohibit savings and loan holding companies and their nonthrift subsidiaries from engaging in activities other than those which are specifically enumerated in the regulations. However, the unitary savings and loan holding company relationship among HEI, ASB Hawaii and ASB is “grandfathered” under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (Gramm Act) so that HEI and its subsidiaries are able to continue to engage in their current activities so long as ASB satisfies the qualified thrift lender (QTL) test discussed under “Bank—Regulation—Qualified thrift lender test.” ASB met the QTL test at all times during 2017; however, the failure of ASB to satisfy the QTL test in the future could result in a need for HEI to divest ASB. 
HEI is also affected by provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to corporate governance and executive compensation, including provisions requiring shareholder “say on pay” and “say on pay frequency” votes, mandating additional disclosures concerning executive compensation and compensation consultants and advisors and further restricting proxy voting by brokers in the absence of instructions. See “Bank—Legislation and regulation” in HEI’s MD&A for a discussion of effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on HEI and ASB.
Restrictions on dividends and other distributions.  HEI is a legal entity separate and distinct from its various subsidiaries. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, HEI’s principal sources of funds are dividends or other distributions from its operating subsidiaries, borrowings and sales of equity. The rights of HEI and, consequently, its creditors and shareholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of its subsidiaries are subject to the prior claims of the creditors and preferred shareholders of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of HEI in its capacity as a creditor are recognized as primary.
The abilities of certain of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI are subject to contractual and regulatory restrictions. Under the PUC Agreement, in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the electric utility subsidiaries falls below 35% of the total capitalization of the electric utilities (including the current maturities of long-term debt, but excluding short-term borrowings), the electric utility subsidiaries would, absent PUC approval, be restricted in their payment of cash dividends to 80% of the earnings available for the payment of dividends in the current fiscal year and preceding five years, less the amount of dividends paid during that period. The PUC Agreement also provides that the foregoing dividend restriction shall not be construed as relinquishing any right the PUC may have to review the dividend policies of the electric utility subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017, the consolidated common stock equity of HEI’s electric utility subsidiaries was 57% of their total capitalization (as calculated for purposes of the PUC Agreement). As of December 31, 2017, Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries had common stock equity of $1.8 billion of which approximately $755 million was not available for transfer to HEI without regulatory approval.
The ability of ASB to make capital distributions to HEI and other affiliates is restricted under federal law. Subject to a limited exception for stock redemptions that do not result in any decrease in ASB’s capital and would improve ASB’s financial condition, ASB is prohibited from declaring any dividends, making any other capital distributions, or paying a management fee to a controlling person if, following the distribution or payment, ASB would be deemed to be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. See “Bank—Regulation—Prompt corrective action.” All dividends are subject to 
2

review by the OCC and FRB and receipt of a letter from the FRB communicating the agencies’ non-objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to ASB Hawaii and HEI. Also see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
HEI and its subsidiaries are also subject to debt covenants, preferred stock resolutions and the terms of guarantees that could limit their respective abilities to pay dividends. The Company does not expect that the regulatory and contractual restrictions applicable to HEI and/or its subsidiaries will significantly affect the operations of HEI or its ability to pay dividends on its common stock.
Environmental regulation.  HEI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal and state statutes and governmental regulations pertaining to water quality, air quality and other environmental factors. See the “Environmental regulation” discussions in the “Electric utility” and “Bank” sections below.
Securities ratings.  See the Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch), Moody’s Investors Service’s (Moody’s) and Standard & Poor’s (S&P) ratings of HEI’s and Hawaiian Electric’s securities and discussion under “Liquidity and capital resources” (both “HEI Consolidated” and “Electric utility”) in HEI’s MD&A. These ratings reflect only the view, at the time the ratings are issued, of the applicable rating agency from whom an explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained. There is no assurance that any such credit rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agency if, in such rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Any such lowering, suspension or withdrawal of any rating may have an adverse effect on the market price or marketability of HEI’s and/or Hawaiian Electric’s securities, which could increase the cost of capital of HEI and Hawaiian Electric, and could affect costs, including interest charges, under HEI's and/or Hawaiian Electric's debt securities and credit facilities. Neither HEI nor Hawaiian Electric management can predict future rating agency actions or their effects on the future cost of capital of HEI or Hawaiian Electric.
Revenue bonds have been issued by the Department of Budget and Finance of the State of Hawaii for the benefit of Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries, but the source of their repayment are the unsecured obligations of Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries under loan agreements and notes issued to the Department, including Hawaiian Electric’s guarantees of its subsidiaries’ obligations. The payment of principal and interest due on revenue bonds currently outstanding and issued prior to 2009 are insured, but the ratings of these insurers have been withdrawn—see “Electric Utility—Liquidity and capital resources” in HEI’s MD&A.
Employees.  The Company had full-time employees as follows:
December 31 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013 
HEI | 41 | 41 | 39 | 44 | 43 
Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries | 2,724 | 2,662 | 2,727 | 2,759 | 2,764

 | 3,880 | 3,796 | 3,918 | 3,965 | 3,966

The employees of HEI and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, other than the electric utilities, are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1260 represents roughly half of the Utilities' workforce covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on October 31, 2018.
Properties.  HEI leases office space from nonaffiliated lessors in downtown Honolulu under leases that expire in December 2022. See the discussions under “Electric Utility” and “Bank” below for a description of properties they own and lease.
Hamakua Energy, LLC owns a total of approximately 93 acres located on the Hamakua coast on the island of Hawaii. Its power plant is situated on approximately 59 acres and the remaining 34 acres includes surrounding parcels of which 30 acres are located on the ocean front.
Electric utility
Hawaiian Electric and subsidiaries and service areas.  Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric (Utilities) are regulated operating electric public utilities engaged in the production, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity on the islands of Oahu; Hawaii; and Maui, Lanai and Molokai, respectively. Hawaiian Electric acquired Maui Electric in 1968 and Hawaii Electric Light in 1970. In 2017, the electric utilities’ revenues and net income amounted to approximately 88% and 73% respectively, of HEI’s consolidated revenues and net income, compared to approximately 88% and 58% (impacted by a merger termination fee and other impacts at HEI corporate) in 2016 and approximately 90% and 85% in 2015, respectively.

The islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Lanai and Molokai have a combined population estimated at 1.4 million, or approximately 95% of the total population of the State of Hawaii, and comprise a service area of 5,815 square miles. The principal communities served include Honolulu (on Oahu), Hilo and Kona (on Hawaii) and Wailuku and Kahului (on Maui). The service areas also include numerous suburban communities, resorts, U.S. Armed Forces installations and agricultural operations. The state has granted Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric nonexclusive franchises, which authorize the Utilities to construct, operate and maintain facilities over and under public streets and sidewalks. Each of these franchises will continue in effect for an indefinite period of time until forfeited, altered, amended or repealed.

* As of December 31.
Seasonality.  Kilowatthour (KWH) sales of the Utilities follow a seasonal pattern, but they do not experience extreme seasonal variations due to extreme weather variations experienced by some electric utilities on the U.S. mainland. KWH sales in Hawaii tend to increase in the warmer, more humid months as a result of increased demand for air conditioning.
Significant customers.  The Utilities derived approximately 11% of their operating revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015 from the sale of electricity to various federal government agencies.
Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and/or executive orders: (1) federal agencies must establish energy conservation goals for federally funded programs, (2) goals were set to reduce federal agencies’ energy consumption by 3% per year up to 30% by fiscal year 2015 relative to fiscal year 2003, and (3) renewable energy goals were established for electricity consumed by federal agencies. Executive Order 13693 signed in March 2015, updated the earlier provisions and adopted new reduction targets for years after fiscal year 2015, requiring federal buildings to achieve a 2.5% reduction in consumption annually. Hawaiian Electric continues to work with various federal agencies to implement measures that will help them achieve their energy reduction and renewable energy objectives.
State of Hawaii and U.S. Department of Energy MOU.  On September 15, 2014, the State of Hawaii and the U.S. Department of Energy executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) recognizing that Hawaii is embarking on the next phase of its clean energy future. The MOU provides the framework for a comprehensive, sustained effort to better realize its vast renewable energy potential and allow Hawaii to push forward in three main areas: the power sector, transportation and energy efficiency. This next phase is focused on stimulating deployment of clean energy infrastructure as a catalyst for economic growth, energy system innovation and test bed investments.
Energy Efficiency. The PUC issued an order on January 3, 2012 approving a framework for Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standards (EEPS) that set 2008 as the initial base year for evaluation and linearly allocated the 2030 goal to interim incremental reduction goals of 1,375 GWH by 2015 and 975 GWH by each of the years 2020, 2025 and 2030. These goals may be revised through goal evaluations scheduled every five years or as the result of recommendations by an EEPS technical working group (TWG) for consideration by the PUC. Pursuant to the PUC's EEPS framework, the PUC has contracted with a public benefits fee administrator to operate and manage energy efficiency programs, and any incentive and/or penalty mechanisms related to the achievement of the goals are at the discretion of the PUC. 
The Division of Consumer Advocacy’s 2017 Compliance Resolution Fund Report states that it appears Hawaii has met its 2016 Renewable Portfolio Standards and EEPS goals and is progressing towards its 2020 goals. The EEPS has contributed to lower sales; however, the implementation of decoupling has delinked sales and revenues. See "Decoupling" in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Electrification of Transportation. In December 2016, a coalition of eight public, private and non-profit organizations came together to form Drive Electric Hawaii and entered into a MOU that put forth a shared a vision of supporting and promoting electrification transportation. Drive Electric Hawaii seeks to promote the use of electric vehicles, cuts fossil-fuel transportation and adds more renewable energy through collaboration on education, promotion, advocacy and infrastructure.

Generating reliability and reserve margin.  Hawaiian Electric serves the island of Oahu and Hawaii Electric Light serves the island of Hawaii. Maui Electric has three separate electrical systems—one each on the islands of Maui, Molokai and Lanai. Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric have isolated electrical systems that are not currently interconnected to each other or to any other electrical grid and, thus, each maintains a higher level of reserve generation than is typically carried by interconnected mainland U.S. utilities, which are able to share reserve capacity. These higher levels of reserve margins are required to meet peak electric demands, to provide for scheduled maintenance of generating units (including the units operated by IPPs relied upon for firm capacity) and to allow for the forced outage of the largest generating unit in the system.
See “Adequacy of supply” in HEI’s MD&A under “Electric utility.”
Nonutility generation.  The Utilities have supported state and federal energy policies which encourage the development of renewable energy sources that reduce the use of fuel oil as well as the development of qualifying facilities. The Utilities' renewable energy sources and potential sources range from wind, solar, photovoltaic, geothermal, wave and hydroelectric power to energy produced by the municipal waste and other biofuels.
The rate schedules of the electric utilities contain ECACs and PPACs that allow them to recover costs of fuel and purchase power expenses. The PUC approved the PPACs for the first time for Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric in March 2011, February 2012 and May 2012, respectively.
In addition to the firm capacity PPAs described below, the electric utilities also purchase energy on an as-available basis directly from nonutility generators and through its Feed-In Tariff programs. The electric utilities also receive renewable energy from customers under its Net Energy Metering and Customer Grid Supply programs.
The PUC has allowed rate recovery for the firm capacity and purchased energy costs for the electric utilities’ approved firm capacity and as-available energy PPAs.

Hawaiian Electric firm capacity PPAs.  Hawaiian Electric currently has three major PPAs that provide a total of 456.5 MW of firm capacity, representing 27% of Hawaiian Electric’s total net generating and firm purchased capacity on the Island of Oahu as of December 31, 2017. 
In March 1988, Hawaiian Electric entered into a PPA with AES Barbers Point, Inc. (now known as AES Hawaii, Inc. (AES Hawaii)), a Hawaii-based, indirect subsidiary of The AES Corporation. The agreement with AES Hawaii, as amended (through Amendment No. 2), provides that, for a period of 30 years beginning September 1992, Hawaiian Electric will purchase 180 megawatts (MW) of firm capacity. The AES Hawaii coal-fired cogeneration plant utilizes a “clean coal” technology and is designed to sell sufficient steam to be a “Qualifying Facility” (QF) under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). See “Commitments and contingencies–Power purchase agreements–AES Hawaii, Inc.” in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an update regarding this PPA. 
In October 1988, Hawaiian Electric entered into an agreement with Kalaeloa Partners, L.P. (Kalaeloa), a limited partnership, which, through affiliates, contracted to design, build, operate and maintain a QF. The agreement with Kalaeloa, as amended, provided that Hawaiian Electric would purchase 180 MW of firm capacity for a period of 25 years beginning in May 1991 and terminating in May 2016. The Kalaeloa facility is a combined-cycle operation, consisting of two oil-fired combustion turbines burning low sulfur fuel oil (LSFO) and a steam turbine that utilizes waste heat from the combustion turbines. Following two additional amendments, effective in 2005, Kalaeloa currently supplies Hawaiian Electric with 208 MW of firm capacity. In January 2011, Hawaiian Electric initiated renegotiation of the agreement with Kalaeloa (exempt from the PUC’s Competitive Bidding Framework). The PPA, as amended, automatically extends on a month-to-month basis as long as the parties are still negotiating in good faith. Hawaiian Electric and Kalaeloa have agreed that neither party will terminate the PPA prior to October 31, 2018. This agreement complements continued negotiations between the parties and accounts for time needed for PUC approval of a negotiated resolution.
Hawaiian Electric also entered into a PPA in March 1986 and a firm capacity amendment in April 1991 with the City and County of Honolulu with respect to a refuse-fired plant (HPOWER). Under the amended PPA, the HPOWER facility supplied Hawaiian Electric with 46 MW of firm capacity. In May 2012, Hawaiian Electric entered into an amended and restated PPA with the City and County of Honolulu to purchase additional firm capacity (including the then existing 46 MW) from the expanded HPOWER facility for a term of 20 years from the commercial operation date (April 2, 2013). Under the amended and restated PPA, which the PUC approved, Hawaiian Electric purchases 68.5 MW of firm capacity.
Hawaii Electric Light firm capacity PPAs.  As of December 31, 2017, Hawaii Electric Light has two major PPAs that provide a total of for 94.6 MW of firm capacity, representing 34% of Hawaii Electric Light's total net generating and firm purchased capacity on the Island of Hawaii as of December 31, 2017. 
Hawaii Electric Light has a 35-year PPA with Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) for 30 MW of firm capacity from its geothermal steam facility, which will expire on December 31, 2027. In February 2011, Hawaii Electric Light and PGV amended the PPA for the pricing on a portion of the energy payments and entered into a new PPA for Hawaii Electric Light to acquire an additional 8 MW of firm, dispatchable capacity. The PUC approved the amendment and the new PPA in December 2011. PGV’s expansion became commercially operational in March 2012 for a total facility capacity of 34.6 MW.
In October 1997, Hawaii Electric Light entered into an agreement with Encogen, which was succeeded by Hamakua Energy Partners, L. P. (HEP). The agreement requires Hawaii Electric Light to purchase up to 60 MW (net) of firm capacity for a period of 30 years, expiring on December 31, 2030. The dual-train combined-cycle (DTCC) facility, which primarily burns naphtha (a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons), consists of two oil-fired combustion turbines and a steam turbine that utilizes waste heat from the combustion turbines. In December 2015, Hawaii Electric Light signed an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) to purchase the 60 MW generating plant from HEP, and in February 2016, filed an application with the PUC requesting approval of the APA. In May 2017, the PUC denied the application on the grounds that customer benefits were not sufficiently demonstrated to justify the purchase and in July 2017, the APA was terminated. In November 2017, Hamakua Energy, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of HEI, purchased the plant from HEP. 
In May 2012, Hawaii Electric Light signed a PPA with Hu Honua Bioenergy, LLC (Hu Honua) for 21.5 MW of renewable, dispatchable firm capacity fueled by locally grown biomass on the island of Hawaii. This PPA was approved by the PUC in December 2013. Per the terms of the PPA, the Hu Honua plant was scheduled to be in service in 2016, however, Hu Honua encountered construction delays, failed to meet its obligations under the PPA, and failed to provide adequate assurances that it could perform or had the financial means to perform. Hawaii Electric Light terminated the PPA on March 1, 2016. On November 30, 2016, Hu Honua filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii that included claims purportedly arising out of the termination of Hu Honua’s PPA. On May 26, 2017, Hawaii Electric Light and Hu Honua entered into a settlement agreement to settle claims related to the termination of the original PPA. The settlement agreement was contingent on the PUC’s approval of an amended and restated PPA between Hawaii Electric Light and Hu Honua dated May 5, 2017. The Amended and Restated PPA was approved by the PUC on July 28, 2017. On August 25, 2017, 
7

the PUC's approval was appealed by a third party. The appeal is still pending. Hu Honua is expected to be on-line by the end of 2018.
Maui Electric firm capacity PPAs.  Maui Electric has no firm power PPAs. 
Fuel oil usage and supply.  The rate schedules of the Utilities include ECACs under which electric rates (and consequently the revenues of the electric utility subsidiaries generally) are adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power. See discussion of rates and issues relating to the ECAC below under “Rates,” and “Electric utility—Certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition—Regulation of electric utility rates” and “Electric utility—Material estimates and critical accounting policies–Revenues” in HEI’s MD&A.
Hawaiian Electric’s steam generating units consume low sulfur fuel oil (LSFO) and Hawaiian Electric’s combustion turbine peaking units consume diesel, except for Hawaiian Electric's Campbell Industrial Park generating facility which operates exclusively on B99 grade biodiesel.
Hawaii Electric Light’s and Maui Electric’s steam generating units burn industrial fuel oil (IFO) and Hawaii Electric Light’s and Maui Electric’s Maui combustion turbine generating units burn diesel. Hawaii Electric Light’s and Maui Electric’s Maui, Molokai, and Lanai diesel engine generating units burn ultra-low-sulfur diesel. All of the fuel purchased for the Utilities(except for fuel purchased for Lanai) is purchased under the new fuel supply contracts with Island Energy Services, LLC (previously with Chevron Products Company), which began on January 1, 2017 and will terminate at the end of 2019.
See the fuel oil commitments information set forth in the “Fuel contracts” section in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following table sets forth the average cost of fuel oil used by Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric to generate electricity in 2017, 2016 and 2015:

 | Hawaiian Electric | Hawaii Electric Light | | Maui Electric | Consolidated
 | $/Barrel | ¢/MBtu | | $/Barrel | ¢/MBtu | $/Barrel | | ¢/MBtu | $/Barrel | ¢/MBtu
2017 | 67.96 | | 1,087.1 | | 68.02 | | 1,125.2 | | 72.29 | | 1,214.6 | 68.78 | 1,114.3
2016 | 51.30 | | 815.2 | | 53.27 | | 876.9 | | 62.21 | | 1,048.6 | 53.49 | 862.3 
2015 | 71.86 | | 1,144.8 | | 79.03 | | 1,307.3 | | 84.38 | | 1,425.7 | 74.71 | 1,206.5

The average per-unit cost of fuel oil consumed to generate electricity for Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric reflects a different volume mix of fuel types and grades as follows:

 | Hawaiian Electric | Hawaii Electric Light | | Maui Electric
 | % LSFO | | % Biodiesel/Diesel | | % IFO | % Diesel | % IFO | % Diesel
2017 | 95 | | 5 | | 43 | 57 | 23 | 77 
2016 | 97 | | 3 | | 49 | 51 | 19 | 81 
2015 | 96 | | 4 | | 43 | 57 | 16 | 84 

In December 2000, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric executed contracts of private carriage with Hawaiian Interisland Towing, Inc. for the employment of a double-hull tank barge for the shipment of industrial fuel oil (IFO) and diesel supplies from their fuel suppliers’ facilities on Oahu to storage locations on the islands of Hawaii and Maui, respectively, commencing January 1, 2002. The contracts have been extended through December 31, 2021. In July 2011, the carriage contracts were assigned to Kirby Corporation (Kirby), which provides refined petroleum and other products for marine transportation, distribution and logistics services in the U.S. domestic marine transportation industry.
Kirby never takes title to the fuel oil or diesel fuel, but does have custody and control while the fuel is in transit from Oahu. If there were an oil spill in transit, Kirby is generally contractually obligated to indemnify Hawaii Electric Light and/or Maui Electric for resulting clean-up costs, fines and damages. Kirby maintains liability insurance coverage for an amount in excess of $1 billion for oil spill related damage. State law provides a cap of $700 million on liability for releases of heavy fuel oil transported interisland by tank barge. In the event of a release, Hawaii Electric Light and/or Maui Electric may be responsible for any clean-up, damages, and/or fines that Kirby and its insurance carrier do not cover.
The prices that Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric pay for purchased energy from certain older nonutility generators are generally linked to the price of oil. The AES Hawaii energy prices vary primarily with an inflation index. The energy prices for Kalaeloa, which purchases LSFO from Par Hawaii Refining, LLC (PAR), vary primarily with the price of Asian crude oil. A portion of PGV energy prices are based on the electric utilities’ respective short-run avoided energy 
8

cost rates (which vary with their composite fuel costs), subject to minimum floor rates specified in their approved PPA. Hamakua Energy energy prices vary primarily with the cost of naphtha.
The Utilities estimate that the net energy they generate or purchase based on fossil fuel oil in 2018 will be comparable to 68% in 2017. Hawaiian Electric generally maintains an average system fuel inventory level equivalent to 47 days of forward consumption. Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric generally maintain an average system fuel inventory level equivalent to approximately one month’s supply of both MSFO and diesel. The PPAs with AES Hawaii and Hamakua Energy require that they maintain certain minimum fuel inventory levels.
Rates.  Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the PUC with respect to rates, issuance of securities, accounting and certain other matters. See “Regulation” below.
General rate increases require the prior approval of the PUC after public and contested case hearings. Rates for Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries include ECACs and PPACs. Under current law and practices, specific and separate PUC approval is not required for each rate change pursuant to automatic rate adjustment clauses previously approved by the PUC. PURPA requires the PUC to periodically review the ECACs of electric and gas utilities in the state, and such clauses, as well as the rates charged by the utilities generally, are subject to change. PUC approval is also required for all surcharges and adjustments before they are reflected in rates.
See “Electric utility–Most recent rate proceedings,” “Electric utility–Certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition–Regulation of electric utility rates” and “Electric utility–Material estimates and critical accounting policies–Revenues” in HEI’s MD&A and “Interim increases” and “Utility projects” under “Commitments and contingencies” in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Public Utilities Commission and Division of Consumer Advocacy of the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs of the State of Hawaii.  Randall Y. Iwase is the Chair of the PUC (for a term that will expire in June 2020) and was formerly a state legislator, Honolulu city council member, supervising deputy attorney general, and Chair of the Hawaii State Tax Review Commission. The other commissioners are Lorraine H. Akiba (for a term that will expire in June 2018), who previously was an attorney in private practice who earlier served as the Director of the State Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, and James Griffin (for a term that will expire in June 2022), who was previously a faculty member at the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute before serving as the PUC's Chief of Policy and Research.
The Division of Consumer Advocacy is led by its Executive Director, Dean Nishina, who most recently served as the division's Public Utilities Administrator.
Competition.  See “Electric utility–Certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition–Competition” in HEI’s MD&A.
Electric and magnetic fields.  The generation, transmission and use of electricity produces low-frequency (50Hz-60Hz) electrical and magnetic fields (EMF). While EMF has been classified as a possible human carcinogen by more than one public health organization and remains the subject of ongoing studies and evaluations, no definite causal relationship between EMF and health risks has been clearly demonstrated to date and there are no federal standards in the U.S. limiting occupational or residential exposure to 50Hz-60Hz EMF. The Utilities are continuing to monitor the ongoing research and continue to participate in utility industry funded studies on EMF and, where technically feasible and economically reasonable, continue to pursue a policy of prudent avoidance in the design and installation of new transmission and distribution facilities. Management cannot predict the impact, if any, the EMF issue may have on the Utilities in the future.
Global climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction.  The Utilities share the concerns of many regarding the potential effects of global climate changes and the human contributions to this phenomenon, including burning of fossil fuels for electricity production, transportation, manufacturing and agricultural activities, as well as deforestation. Recognizing that effectively addressing global climate changes requires commitment by the private sector, all levels of government, and the public, the Utilities are committed to taking direct action to mitigate GHG emissions from its operations. See “Electric utility risk–Global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions reduction” under “Item 1A. Risk factors.” 
Legislation.  See “Electric utility–Legislation and regulation” in HEI’s MD&A.
Commitments and contingencies.  See “Selected contractual obligations and commitments” in Hawaiian Electric’s MD&A and “Electric utility–Certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition–Other regulatory and permitting contingencies” in HEI’s MD&A, Item 1A. Risk Factors, and Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of important commitments and contingencies.
Regulation.  The PUC regulates the rates, issuance of securities, accounting and certain other aspects of the operations of Hawaiian Electric and its electric utility subsidiaries. See the previous discussion under “Rates” and the discussions under 
9

“Electric utility–Results of operations–Most recent rate proceedings” and “Electric utility–Certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition–Regulation of electric utility rates” in HEI’s MD&A.
Any adverse decision or policy made or adopted by the PUC, or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision, could have a material adverse effect on consolidated Hawaiian Electric’s and the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
On September 15, 2014, the State of Hawaii and the U.S. Department of Energy executed a MOU recognizing that Hawaii is embarking on the next phase of its clean energy future. See "State of Hawaii and U.S. Department of Energy MOU" above.
In 2015, Hawaii’s RPS law was amended to require electric utilities to meet an RPS of 15%, 30%, 40%, 70% and 100% by December 31, 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2045 respectively. Energy savings resulting from energy efficiency programs do not count toward the RPS since 2014 (only electrical generation using renewable energy as a source counts).
Certain transactions between HEI’s electric public utility subsidiaries (Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric) and HEI and affiliated interests (as defined by statute) are subject to regulation by the PUC. All contracts of $300,000 or more in a calendar year for management, supervisory, construction, engineering, accounting, legal, financial and similar services and for the sale, lease or transfer of property between a public utility and affiliated interests must be filed with the PUC to be effective, and the PUC may issue cease and desist orders if such contracts are not filed. All such “affiliated contracts” for capital expenditures (except for real property) must be accompanied by comparative price quotations from two nonaffiliates, unless the quotations cannot be obtained without substantial expense. Moreover, all transfers of $300,000 or more of real property between a public utility and affiliated interests require the prior approval of the PUC and proof that the transfer is in the best interest of the public utility and its customers. If the PUC, in its discretion, determines that an affiliated contract is unreasonable or otherwise contrary to the public interest, the utility must either revise the contract or risk disallowance of payments under the contract for rate-making purposes. In rate-making proceedings, a utility must also prove the reasonableness of payments made to affiliated interests under any affiliated contract of $300,000 or more by clear and convincing evidence.
In December 1996, the PUC issued an order in a docket that had been opened to review the relationship between HEI and Hawaiian Electric and the effects of that relationship on the operations of Hawaiian Electric. The order adopted the report of the consultant the PUC had retained and ordered Hawaiian Electric to continue to provide the PUC with periodic status reports on its compliance with the PUC Agreement (pursuant to which HEI became the holding company of Hawaiian Electric). Hawaiian Electric files such status reports annually. In the order, the PUC also required the Utilities to present a comprehensive analysis of the impact that the holding company structure and investments in nonutility subsidiaries have on a case-by-case basis on the cost of capital to each utility in future rate cases and remove any such effects from the cost of capital. The Utilities have made presentations in their subsequent rate cases to support their positions that there was no evidence that would modify the PUC’s finding that Hawaiian Electric’s access to capital did not suffer as a result of HEI’s involvement in nonutility activities and that HEI’s diversification did not permanently raise or lower the cost of capital incorporated into the rates paid by Hawaiian Electric’s utility customers.
The Utilities are not subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act, except under Sections 210 through 212 (added by Title II of PURPA and amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992), which permit the FERC to order electric utilities to interconnect with qualifying cogenerators and small power producers, and to wheel power to other electric utilities. Title I of PURPA, which relates to retail regulatory policies for electric utilities, and Title VII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which addresses transmission access, also apply to the Utilities. The Utilities are also required to file various operational reports with the FERC.
Because they are located in the State of Hawaii, Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries are exempt by statute from limitations set forth in the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 on the use of petroleum as a primary energy source.
See also “HEI–Regulation” above.
Environmental regulation.  Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, like other utilities, are subject to periodic inspections by federal, state and, in some cases, local environmental regulatory agencies, including agencies responsible for the regulation of water quality, air quality, hazardous and other waste and hazardous materials. These inspections may result in the identification of items needing corrective or other action. Except as otherwise disclosed in this report (see “Certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition–Environmental matters” for HEI Consolidated, the Electric utility and the Bank sections in HEI’s MD&A and Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference), the Company believes that each subsidiary has appropriately responded to environmental conditions requiring action and that, as a result of such actions, such environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company or Hawaiian Electric.
10

Water quality controls.  The generating stations, substations and other utility facilities operate under federal and state water quality regulations and permits, including but not limited to the Clean Water Act National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (governing point source discharges, including wastewater and storm water discharges) and the Safe Drinking Water Act Underground Injection Control (regulating disposal of wastewater into the subsurface). On February 1, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that under certain circumstances, discharges from underground injection control wells may require National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits. The Utilities are evaluating the impact of this decision on their facilities.
Oil pollution controls.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) establishes programs that governing actual or threatened oil releases and imposing strict liability on responsible parties for clean-up costs and damages to natural resources and property. The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations under OPA require certain facilities that use or store oil to prepare and implement Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plans in order to prevent releases of oil to navigable waters of the U.S. Certain facilities are also required to prepare and implement Facility Response Plans (FRPs) to ensure prompt and proper response to releases of oil. The utility facilities that are subject to SPCC Plan and FRP requirements have prepared and implemented SPCC Plans and FRPs.
Air quality controls.  The Clean Air Act (CAA) establishes permitting programs to reduce air pollution. The CAA amendments of 1990, established the federal Title V Operating Permit Program (in Hawaii known as the Covered Source Permit program) to ensure compliance with all applicable federal and state air pollution control requirements. The 1977 CAA Amendments established the New Source Review (NSR) permitting program which affect new or modified generating units by requiring a permit to construct under the CAA and the controls necessary to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). 
Title V operating permits have been issued for all of the Utilities’ affected generating units.
Hazardous waste and toxic substances controls.  The operations of the electric utility are subject to EPA regulations that implement provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, also known as Superfund), the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).
RCRA underground storage tank (UST) regulations require all facilities that use USTs for storing petroleum products to comply with established leak detection, spill prevention, standards for tank design and retrofits, financial assurance, operator training, and tank decommissioning and closure requirements. All of the Utilities’ USTs currently meet the applicable requirements.
The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act under SARA Title III requires the Utilities to report potentially hazardous chemicals present in their facilities in order to provide the public with information so that emergency procedures can be established to protect the public in the event of hazardous chemical releases. Since January 1, 1998, the steam electric industry category has been subject to Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reporting requirements.
The TSCA regulations specify procedures for the handling and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a compound found in some transformer and capacitor dielectric fluids. The TSCA regulations also apply to responses to releases of PCBs to the environment. The Utilities have instituted procedures to monitor compliance with these regulations and have implemented a program to identify and replace PCB transformers and capacitors in their systems. In April 2010, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rule Making announcing its intent to reassess PCB regulations. The EPA has ceased activity on the PCB reassessment.
Hawaii’s Environmental Response Law (ERL), as amended, governs releases of hazardous substances, including oil, to the environment in areas within the state’s jurisdiction. Responsible parties under the ERL are jointly, severally, and strictly liable for a release of a hazardous substance. Responsible parties include owners or operators of a facility where a hazardous substance is located and any person who at the time of disposal of the hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substance was disposed.
The Utilities periodically discover leaking oil-containing equipment such as USTs, piping, and transformers. Each subsidiary reports releases from such equipment when and as required by applicable law and addresses the releases in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
Research and development.  The Utilities expensed approximately $3.8 million, $4.2 million and $3.3 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for research and development (R&D). In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the electric utilities’ contributions to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) accounted for approximately 58%, 52% and 67% of R&D expenses, respectively. The Utilities continue to collaborate with EPRI, Elemental Excelerator, other utilities, national testing labs, leading edge companies and various stakeholders to identify and evaluate what new technologies and solutions are being developed, tested, and 
11

implemented elsewhere and can be applied to integrate more renewable distributed energy resources onto the utility grid, modernizing grid infrastructure, and helping the State achieve a 100% clean energy future. The Utilities utilize an expanded reference of R&D to highlight the demonstration of technologies. Included in the R&D expenses were amounts related to evaluating, testing, and demonstrating new and emerging technologies, energy storage, demand response, environmental compliance, power quality, electric and hybrid plug in vehicles and other renewables (e.g., integration of distributed energy resources onto the utility grid, grid modernization, solar resource evaluation, advanced inverter testing, and modeling of high PV penetration circuits).

Properties. Hawaiian Electric owns four generating plants on the island of Oahu at Waiau, Kahe, Campbell Industrial Park (CIP) and Honolulu. Hawaiian Electric currently operates three of the four generation plants; the fourth, in downtown Honolulu, was deactivated in 2014. These three plants have an aggregate net generating capability of 1,214 MW as of December 31, 2017. The City and County of Honolulu is seeking to condemn a portion of the Honolulu plant site for its rail project. The four plants are situated on Hawaiian Electric-owned land having a combined area of 542 acres and three parcels of land totaling 5.7 acres under leases expiring between December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2021, with options to extend to June 30, 2026. Additionally, Hawaiian Electric has negotiated two leases: 1) a 35 year lease, effective September 1, 2016 with an option to extend an additional 10 years with the Department of the Army to install, operate, and maintain a 50 MW power generation plant on 8.13 acres, and 2) a 37 year lease, effective July 1, 2017 with the Secretary of the Navy to install, operate and maintain a 28 MW (dc) renewable generation site on 102 acres. In addition, Hawaiian Electric owns a total of 132 acres of land on which substations, transformer vaults, distribution baseyards and the Kalaeloa cogeneration facility are located.
Hawaiian Electric owns buildings and approximately 11.6 acres of land located in Honolulu which house its operating and engineering departments. It also leases an office building and certain office spaces in Honolulu, and a warehousing center in Kapolei. The lease for the office building expires in November 2021, with an option to extend through November 2024. Leases for certain office and warehouse spaces expire on various dates from March 31, 2018 through July 31, 2025, some with options to extend to various dates through December 31, 2034.
Hawaiian Electric's Barbers Point Tank Farm (BPTF) has three storage tanks with an aggregate of 1 million barrels of storage for low sulfur fuel oil (LSFO). The BPTF is located in Campbell Industrial Park, on the same property as the CIP Generating Station, and is the central fuel storage facility where LSFO purchased by Hawaiian Electric is received and stored. From the BPTF, LSFO is transported via Hawaiian Electric owned underground pipelines to the Kahe and Waiau Power Plants. Hawaiian Electric also has fuel storage facilities at each of its plant sites with a nominal aggregate capacity of 770,000 barrels for LSFO storage, 44,000 barrels for diesel storage and 88,000 barrels for biodiesel storage. Hawaiian Electric also owns a fuel storage facility at Iwilei that was used to provide fuel to the Honolulu Power Plant. The Honolulu Power Plant was deactivated on January 31, 2014 and any future fuel supplies will be delivered directly to the plant by truck. The removal of the Iwilei fuel storage facility's tanks and pumping infrastructure was completed in 2017, and the facility is being reconfigured for other purposes.
Hawaii Electric Light owns and operates four generating plants on the island of Hawaii in Hilo, Waimea, Keahole and Puna, along with distributed generators at substation sites. These plants have an aggregate net generating capability of 182 MW as of December 31, 2017 (excluding several small run-of-river hydro units). Hawaii Electric Light's Shipman plant in Hilo was deactivated in 2014 and retired in 2015. The plants (including a baseyard on the same parcel as the Hilo plant) are situated on Hawaii Electric Light-owned land having a combined area of approximately 44 acres. The distributed generators are located within Hawaii Electric Light-owned substation sites having a combined area of approximately 4 acres. Hawaii Electric Light also owns fuel storage facilities at these sites with a usable storage capacity of 48,000 barrels of medium sulfur fuel oil (MSFO) and 81,802 barrels of diesel. There are an additional 19,200 barrels of diesel and 22,770 barrels of MSFO storage capacity for Hawaii Electric Light-owned fuel off-site at Island Energy Services, LLC (Island Energy)-owned terminalling facilities (previously Chevron-owned). Hawaii Electric Light pays a storage fee to Island Energy and has no other interest in the property, tanks or other infrastructure situated on their property. Hawaii Electric Light also owns 6 acres of land in Kona, which is used for a baseyard, and one acre of land in Hilo, which houses its accounting, customer services and administrative offices. Hawaii Electric Light also leases 3.7 acres of land for its baseyard in Hilo under a lease expiring in 2030. In addition, Hawaii Electric Light owns a total of approximately 100 acres of land, and leases a total of approximately 8.5 acres of land, on which hydro facilities, substations and switching stations, microwave facilities and transmission lines are located. The deeds to the sites located in Hilo contain certain restrictions, but the restrictions do not materially interfere with the use of the sites for public utility purposes.
On 37.7 acres of its land, Maui Electric: (1) owns and operates two generating plants on the island of Maui, at Kahului and Maalaea, with an aggregate net generating capability of 246 MW as of December 31, 2017, (2) has offices (administrative, 
12

engineering and distribution departments) in Kahului and (3) owns fuel oil storage facilities with a total maximum usable capacity of 81,272 barrels of MSFO and 94,586 barrels of diesel. There are an additional 56,358 barrels of diesel oil storage capacity off-site at Aloha Petroleum, Ltd. (Aloha Petroleum)-owned terminalling facilities, for which Maui Electric pays storage fees. Maui Electric also owns two, 1 MW stand-by diesel generators and a 6,000 gallon fuel storage tank in Hana and 65.7 acres of undeveloped land at Waena.
Maui Electric also owns and operates smaller distribution systems, generation systems (with an aggregate net capability of 22 MW as of December 31, 2017) and fuel storage facilities on the islands of Lanai and Molokai, primarily on its own land.
Other properties.  The Utilities own overhead transmission and distribution lines, underground cables, poles (some jointly) and metal high voltage towers. Electric lines are located over or under public and nonpublic properties. Lines are added when needed to serve increased loads and/or for reliability reasons. In some design districts on Oahu, lines must be placed underground. Under Hawaii law, the PUC generally must determine whether new 46 kilovolt (kV), 69 kV or 138 kV lines can be constructed overhead or must be placed underground.
See “Hawaiian Electric and subsidiaries and service areas” above for a discussion of the nonexclusive franchises of Hawaiian Electric and subsidiaries. Most of the leases, easements and licenses for Hawaiian Electric’s, Hawaii Electric Light’s and Maui Electric’s lines have been recorded.
See “Generation statistics” above and “Limited insurance” in HEI’s MD&A for a further discussion of some of the electric utility properties.
Bank
General.  ASB was granted a federal savings bank charter in January 1987. Prior to that time, ASB had operated since 1925 as the Hawaii division of American Savings & Loan Association of Salt Lake City, Utah. As of December 31, 2017, ASB was one of the largest financial institutions in the State of Hawaii based on total assets of $6.8 billion and deposits of $5.9 billion. In 2017, ASB’s revenues and net income amounted to approximately 12% and 41% of HEI’s consolidated revenues and net income, respectively, compared to approximately 12% and 23% (impacted by the merger termination fee and other impacts at HEI corporate) in 2016 and approximately 10% and 34% in 2015, respectively.
At the time of HEI’s acquisition of ASB in 1988, HEI agreed with the OTS’ predecessor regulatory agency that ASB’s regulatory capital would be maintained at a level of at least 6% of ASB’s total liabilities, or at such greater amount as may be required from time to time by regulation. Under the agreement, HEI’s obligation to contribute additional capital to ensure that ASB would have the capital level required by the OTS was limited to a maximum aggregate amount of approximately $65.1 million. As of December 31, 2017, as a result of certain HEI contributions of capital to ASB, HEI’s maximum obligation under the agreement to contribute additional capital has been reduced to approximately $28.3 million. ASB is subject to OCC regulations on dividends and other distributions and ASB must receive a letter from the FRB communicating the OCC's and FRB's non-objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to declare and pay to ASB Hawaii and HEI.
The following table sets forth selected data for ASB (average balances calculated using the average daily balances):

The decrease in the loans receivable balance in 2017 was primarily due to decreases in the commercial, commercial real estate, and commercial construction loan portfolios, partly offset by growth in the residential 1-4 family, home equity lines of credit (HELOC), and consumer loan portfolios. The decrease in the commercial loan portfolio was primarily due to the strategic reductions in the portfolio, including a $75 million reduction in ASB's nationally syndicated loan portfolio. The decrease in the commercial real estate loan portfolio was primarily due to paydown of a large commercial real estate credit. The growth in the residential 1-4 family, HELOC and consumer loan portfolios were consistent with ASB's loan growth strategy.
The increase in the loans receivable balance in 2016 was primarily due to growth in the commercial real estate, consumer, commercial construction and HELOC loan portfolios as a result of demand for these loan types, partly offset by a decrease in the commercial and residential 1-4 family loan portfolios. The growth in the commercial real estate, consumer, commercial construction and HELOC loan portfolios was consistent with ASB's loan growth strategy. The decrease in the commercial loan portfolio was due to the strategic reduction of ASB's nationally syndicated loan portfolio by $93 million. The decrease in the residential loan portfolio was due to ASB's decision to sell a portion of its loan production with low interest rates to control its interest rate risk.
The increase in the loans receivable balance in 2015 was primarily due to growth in commercial real estate, HELOC and residential 1-4 family loan portfolios, partly offset by a decrease in the commercial loan portfolio. The growth in the commercial real estate, HELOC and residential loan portfolios was driven by demand for this loan type and was consistent with ASB's loan growth strategy.
The increase in the loans receivable balance in 2014 was primarily due to growth in commercial real estate, HELOC, commercial construction and residential 1-4 family loan portfolios. The growth in the commercial real estate and commercial construction loan portfolios were driven by demand for these loan types as the Hawaii economy continues to improve. The growth in the HELOC and residential loan portfolios were consistent with ASB’s mix target and loan growth strategy.

Origination, purchase and sale of loans.  Generally, residential and commercial real estate loans originated by ASB are collateralized by real estate located in Hawaii. For additional information, including information concerning the geographic distribution of ASB’s mortgage-related securities portfolio and the geographic concentration of credit risk, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The demand for loans is primarily dependent on the Hawaii real estate market, business conditions, interest rates and loan refinancing activity.
Residential mortgage lending.  ASB originates fixed rate and adjustable rate loans secured by single family residential property, including investor-owned properties, with maturities of up to 30 years. ASB’s general policy is to require private mortgage insurance when the loan-to-value ratio of the property exceeds 80% of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price at origination. For non-owner-occupied residential properties, the loan-to-value ratio may not exceed 80% of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price at origination.
Construction and development lending.  ASB provides fixed rate loans for the construction of one-to-four unit residential and commercial properties. Construction loan projects are typically short term in nature. Construction and development financing generally involves a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Accordingly, construction and development loans are generally priced higher than loans collateralized by completed structures. ASB’s underwriting, monitoring and disbursement practices with respect to construction and development financing are designed to ensure sufficient funds are available to complete construction projects. See “Loan portfolio risk elements” and “Multifamily residential and commercial real estate lending” below.
Multifamily residential and commercial real estate lending.  ASB provides permanent financing and construction and development financing collateralized by multifamily residential properties (including apartment buildings) and collateralized by commercial and industrial properties (including office buildings, shopping centers and warehouses) for its own portfolio as well as for participation with other lenders. Commercial real estate lending typically involves long lead times to originate and fund. As a result, production results can vary significantly from period to period.
Consumer lending.  ASB offers a variety of secured and unsecured consumer loans. Loans collateralized by deposits are limited to 90% of the available account balance. ASB offers home equity lines of credit, clean energy loans, secured and unsecured VISA cards (through a third party issuer), checking account overdraft protection and other general purpose consumer loans.
Commercial lending.  ASB provides both secured and unsecured commercial loans to business entities. This lending activity is designed to diversify ASB’s asset structure, shorten maturities, improve rate sensitivity of the loan portfolio and attract commercial checking deposits. ASB offers commercial loans with terms up to ten years.
Loan origination fee and servicing income.  In addition to interest earned on residential mortgage loans, ASB receives income from servicing loans, for late payments and from other related services. Servicing fees are received on loans originated and subsequently sold by ASB where ASB acts as collection agent on behalf of third-party purchasers.
16

ASB charges the borrower at loan settlement a loan origination fee. See “Loans receivable” in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Loan portfolio risk elements.  When a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan and does not cure the delinquency promptly, the loan is classified as delinquent. If delinquencies are not cured promptly, ASB normally commences a collection action, including foreclosure proceedings in the case of real estate secured loans. In a foreclosure action, the property collateralizing the delinquent debt is sold at a public auction in which ASB may participate as a bidder to protect its interest. If ASB is the successful bidder, the property is classified as real estate owned until it is sold. As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, ASB had $0.1 million, $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of real estate acquired in settlement of loans.
In addition to delinquent loans, other significant lending risk elements include: (1) loans which accrue interest and are 90 days or more past due as to principal or interest, (2) loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis (nonaccrual loans), and (3) loans on which various concessions are made with respect to interest rate, maturity, or other terms due to the inability of the borrower to service the obligation under the original terms of the agreement (troubled debt restructured loans). ASB loans that were 90 days or more past due on which interest was being accrued as of December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were immaterial or nil. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to nonaccrual and troubled debt restructured loans:

In 2017, nonaccrual loans increased slightly by $0.3 million primarily due to higher nonaccrual residential 1-4 family, HELOC and consumer loans of $1.4 million, $1.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Nonaccrual commercial loans decreased by $3.6 million. ASB evaluates a restructured loan transaction to determine if the borrower is in financial difficulty and if the restructured terms are considered concessions—typically terms that are out of market, beyond normal or reasonable standards, or otherwise not available to a non-troubled borrower in the normal marketplace. A loan classified as TDR must meet both criteria of financial difficulty and concession. Accruing TDR loans decreased by $16.8 million in 2017 primarily due to decreases of $12.4 million, $3.5 million, and $2.3 million of commercial, residential 1-4 family, and residential land loans, respectively, classified as TDRs.
17

In 2016, nonaccrual loans decreased $22.7 million primarily due to upgrades of specific commercial and commercial real estate loans, payoff of a troubled commercial loan and a segment of residential mortgages transferred to held-for-sale. Nonaccrual commercial and residential loans decreased by $13.5 million and $9.4 million, respectively. Accruing TDR loans increased $15.4 million in 2016 primarily due to increases of $13.0 million and $2.5 million of commercial and HELOC loans, respectively, classified as TDR. The increase in commercial loans classified as TDR was primarily due to two commercial credits being classified as TDR.
In 2015, nonaccrual loans increased $9.1 million primarily due to higher nonaccrual commercial loans of $10.1 million. TDR loans decreased $1.9 million in 2015 primarily due to decreases of $2.4 million and $1.9 million of residential land and commercial loans, respectively, classified as TDR. HELOC loans classified as TDR increased by $2.0 million.
In 2014, nonaccrual loans decreased $11.6 million primarily due to the payoff of commercial loans that were on nonaccrual status and repayments in the residential land portfolio. TDR loans increased $5.1 million in 2014 primarily due to increases of $3.8 million and $1.3 million of residential 1-4 and commercial loans, respectively, classified as TDR.
Impact of nonperforming loans on interest income.  The following table presents the gross interest income for both nonaccrual and restructured loans that would have been recognized if such loans had been current in accordance with their original contractual terms, and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for only part of the period. The table also presents the interest income related to these loans that was actually recognized for the period.

Total allowance for loan losses | $ | 45,618 | | | | | | | | $ | 40,116 | | | | 

In 2017, ASB's allowance for loan losses decreased by $1.9 million primarily due to lower loan loss reserves required for the commercial, commercial construction, and commercial real estate loan portfolios as a result of a decrease in the portfolio balances and improving credit trends, partly offset by additional loan loss reserves for the consumer and HELOC loan portfolios. Total delinquencies of $23.6 million at December 31, 2017 was a slight increase of $0.5 million compared to total delinquencies of $23.1 million at December 31, 2016 primarily due to increases in delinquent commercial and consumer loans, offset by decreases in delinquent residential 1-4 family and commercial real estate loans. The ratio of delinquent loans to total loans increased slightly from 0.49% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2016 to 0.51% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2017. Net charge-offs for 2017 were $12.8 million, an increase of $1.5 million compared to $11.3 million for 2016 primarily due to an increase in consumer loan portfolio charge-offs as a result of ASB's strategic expansion of its unsecured consumer loan product offering with risk-based pricing. ASB's provision for loan losses was $10.9 million, a decrease of $5.9 million compared to the provision for loan losses of $16.8 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the release of reserves for commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios due to lower outstanding balances and improved credit quality, partly offset by an increase in loss reserves for the consumer loan portfolio.
20

In 2016, ASB's allowance for loan losses increased by $5.5 million primarily due to growth in the commercial real estate and consumer loan portfolios and increases in reserves for the commercial real estate and unsecured consumer loan portfolios. Total delinquencies of $23.1 million at December 31, 2016 was $3.0 million lower than total delinquencies of $26.1 million at December 31, 2015 primarily due to the movement of $6 million of residential loans to held-for-sale. The ratio of delinquent loans to total loans decreased from 0.57% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2015 to 0.49% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs for 2016 were $11.3 million, an increase of $9.4 million compared to $1.9 million for 2015 primarily due to charge-offs of specific commercial loans and an increase in consumer loan charge-offs as a result of the strategic expansion of ASB's unsecured consumer loan product offering with risk-based pricing. ASB's provision for loan losses was $16.8 million for 2016, an increase of $10.5 million compared to the provision for loan losses of $6.3 million for 2015. The increase in provision for loan losses was driven by growth in the commercial real estate and consumer loan portfolios as well as specific reserves for a few commercial loans.
In 2015, ASB's allowance for loan losses increased by $4.4 million primarily due to growth in the commercial real estate loan portfolio ($159 million or 29.8% growth in outstanding balances) and increases in reserves for commercial loans. Overall loan quality remained strong as total delinquencies of $26.1 million at December 31, 2015 was a slight increase of $0.6 million compared to total delinquencies of $25.5 million at December 31, 2014 primarily due to an increase in delinquent consumer loans. The ratio of delinquent loans to total loans decreased slightly from 0.58% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2014 to 0.57% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2015. Net charge-offs for 2015 were $1.9 million, an increase of $1.3 million compared to $0.6 million for 2014 primarily due to an increase in consumer loan charge-offs as result of the strategic expansion of ASB's unsecured consumer loan product offering with risk-based pricing. ASB's provision for loan losses was $6.3 million for 2015, an increase of $0.2 million compared to the provision for loan losses of $6.1 million for 2014.
In 2014, ASB’s allowance for loan losses increased by $5.5 million primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio ($282 million or 6.8% growth in outstanding balances) and increases in the loss rates of loan portfolios with higher risk such as commercial real estate and unsecured personal loans. Overall loan quality continued to improve as total delinquencies of $25.5 million at December 31, 2014 was a decrease of $8.3 million compared to total delinquencies of $33.8 million at December 31, 2013 due to a decrease in delinquent commercial, commercial real estate and residential land loans. The ratio of delinquent loans to total loans decreased from 0.81% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2013 to 0.58% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2014. Net charge-offs for 2014 were $0.6 million, a decrease of $2.8 million compared to $3.4 million for 2013 primarily due to a decrease in commercial, HELOC and residential land loan charge-offs as a result of the strong economic growth in Hawaii and partially due to the sale of the credit card portfolio in 2013. ASB’s provision for loan losses was $6.1 million for 2014, an increase of $4.6 million compared to provision for loan losses of $1.5 million for 2013 primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio.
See "Bank—Material estimates and critical accounting policies—Allowance for loan losses" in HEI's MD&A for a discussion of allowance for loan losses.
Investment activities.  Currently, ASB’s investment portfolio consists of U.S. Treasury and federal agency obligations, mortgage-related securities, stock of the FHLB of Des Moines and a mortgage revenue bond. ASB owns mortgage-related securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). The weighted-average yield on investments during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was 2.18%, 1.99% and 2.06%, respectively. ASB did not maintain a portfolio of securities held for trading during 2017, 2016 and 2015.
As of December 31, 2017, ASB had $44.5 million of investment securities that were purchased and classified as held-to-maturity. There were no investment securities classified as held-to-maturity as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The investment securities were classified as held-to-maturity to enhance the bank's capital management in a rising rate environment. ASB considers the held-to-maturity classification of these investment securities to be appropriate as the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity.
As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, ASB’s stock in FHLB amounted to $10 million, $11 million and $11 million, respectively. The amount that ASB is required to invest in FHLB stock is determined by FHLB requirements. With the merger of the FHLB of Seattle and the FHLB of Des Moines in the second quarter of 2015, all of ASB's excess stock was repurchased. The amount of stock repurchased in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was nil, nil and $59 million, respectively. See “Stock in FHLB” in HEI’s MD&A. Also, see “Regulation–Federal Home Loan Bank System” below.
ASB does not have any exposure to securities backed by subprime mortgages. See “Investment securities” in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of other-than-temporarily impaired securities.

Deposits and other sources of funds.
General.  Deposits traditionally have been the principal source of ASB’s funds for use in lending, meeting liquidity requirements and making investments. ASB also derives funds from the receipt of interest and principal on outstanding loans receivable and mortgage-related securities, borrowings from the FHLB of Des Moines, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other sources. ASB borrows on a short-term basis to compensate for seasonal or other reductions in deposit flows. ASB also may borrow on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending or investment activities. Advances from the FHLB and securities sold under agreements to repurchase continue to be a source of funds, but they are a higher cost source than deposits.
Deposits.  ASB’s deposits are obtained primarily from residents of Hawaii. Net deposit inflow or outflow, measured as the year-over-year difference in year-end deposits, was an inflow of $342 million in 2017, compared to an inflow of $524 million in 2016 and $402 million in 2015.

Deposit-insurance premiums and regulatory developments.  For a discussion of changes to the deposit insurance system, premiums and Financing Corporation assessments, see “Regulation–Deposit insurance coverage” below.
Other borrowings.  See “Other borrowings” in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. ASB may obtain advances from the FHLB of Des Moines provided that certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are collateralized by a blanket pledge of certain notes held by ASB and the mortgages securing them. To the extent that advances exceed the amount of mortgage loan collateral pledged to the FHLB of Des Moines, the excess must be covered by qualified marketable securities held under the control of and at the FHLB of Des Moines or at an approved third-party custodian. FHLB advances generally are available to meet seasonal and other withdrawals of deposit accounts, to expand lending and to assist in the effort to improve asset and liability management. FHLB advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs offered from time to time by the FHLB of Des Moines.
The decrease in other borrowings in 2017 was due to the payoff of a maturing FHLB advance, offset by an increase in business repurchase agreements. The decrease in other borrowings in 2016 was due to a decrease in public and business repurchase agreements and the maturity of a repurchase agreement with a broker/dealer. The increase in other borrowings in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to an increase in public repurchase agreements. The increase in other borrowings in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to an increase in repurchase agreements with the State of Hawaii. 
Competition.  See “Bank—Executive overview and strategy” and “Bank—Certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition—Competition” in HEI’s MD&A.
The banking industry in Hawaii is highly competitive. At December 31, 2017, there were 8 financial institutions insured by the FDIC headquartered in the State of Hawaii. While ASB is one of the largest financial institutions in Hawaii, based on total assets, ASB faces vigorous competition for deposits and loans from two larger banking institutions based in Hawaii and from smaller institutions that heavily promote their services in niche areas, such as providing financial services to small and medium-sized businesses, as well as national financial services organizations. Competition for loans and deposits comes primarily from other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, securities brokerage firms, money market and mutual funds and other investment alternatives. ASB faces additional competition in seeking deposit funds from various types of corporate and government borrowers, including insurance companies. Competition for origination of mortgage loans comes primarily from mortgage banking and brokerage firms, commercial banks, other savings institutions, insurance companies and real estate investment trusts.
To remain competitive and continue building core franchise value, ASB continues to develop and introduce new products and services to meet the needs of its consumer and commercial customers. Additionally, the banking industry is constantly changing and ASB is making the investment in its people and technology necessary to adapt and remain competitive. ASB competes for deposits primarily on the basis of the variety of types of savings and checking accounts it offers at competitive rates, the quality of the services it provides, the convenience of its branch locations and business hours, and convenient automated teller machines. The primary factors in ASB’s competition for mortgage and other loans are the competitive interest rates and loan origination fees it charges, the wide variety of loan programs it offers and the quality and efficiency of the services it provides to borrowers and the business community.
Regulation.  ASB, a federally chartered savings bank, and its holding companies are subject to the regulatory supervision of the OCC and FRB, respectively, and in certain respects, the FDIC. See “HEI–Regulation” above and “Bank–Certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition–Regulation” in HEI’s MD&A. In addition, ASB must comply with FRB reserve requirements.
Deposit insurance coverage.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, and regulations promulgated by the FDIC, governs insurance coverage of deposit accounts. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000. Generally, the amount of all deposits held by a depositor in the same capacity (even if held in separate accounts) is aggregated for purposes of applying the insurance limit.
23

See “Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessment” in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of FDIC deposit insurance assessment rates. Financing Corporation will continue to impose an assessment on average total assets minus average tangible equity to service the interest on Financing Corporation bond obligations. As of December 31, 2017, ASB’s annual Financing Corporation assessment was 0.52 cents per $100 of average total assets minus average tangible equity.
Federal thrift charter.  See “Bank–Certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition—Regulation—Unitary savings and loan holding company” in HEI’s MD&A, including the discussion of previously proposed legislation that would abolish the charter.
Recent legislation and issuances.  See “Bank–Legislation and regulation” in HEI’s MD&A.
Capital requirements.  The OCC has set four capital requirements for financial institutions. As of December 31, 2017, ASB was in compliance with all of the minimum capital requirements with a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.6% (compared to a 4.0% requirement), a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.0% (compared to a 4.5% requirement), a Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.0% (compared to a 6.0% requirement) and a total capital ratio of 14.2% (compared to a 8.0% requirement).
In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a financial institution must hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets (capital conservation buffer) which is phased-in through 2019. As of December 31, 2017, ASB met the applicable capital requirements, including the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer.
See “Bank-Legislation and regulation” in HEI’s MD&A for the final capital rules under the Basel III regulatory capital framework.
Affiliate transactions.  Significant restrictions apply to certain transactions between ASB and its affiliates, including HEI and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. For example, ASB is prohibited from making any loan or other extension of credit to an entity affiliated with ASB unless the affiliate is engaged exclusively in activities which the FRB has determined to be permissible for bank holding companies. There are also various other restrictions which apply to certain transactions between ASB and certain executive officers, directors and insiders of ASB. ASB is also barred from making a purchase of or any investment in securities issued by an affiliate, other than with respect to shares of a subsidiary of ASB.
Financial Derivatives and Interest Rate Risk.  ASB is subject to OCC rules relating to derivatives activities, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate lock commitments and forward commitments. See “Derivative financial instruments” in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of interest rate lock commitments and forward commitments used by ASB. Currently ASB does not use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk (IRR), but may do so in the future. Generally speaking, the OCC rules permit financial institutions to engage in transactions involving financial derivatives to the extent these transactions are otherwise authorized under applicable law and are safe and sound. The rules require ASB to have certain internal procedures for handling financial derivative transactions, including involvement of the ASB Board of Directors.
With the transfer of the regulatory jurisdiction from the OTS to the OCC, ASB has adopted terminology and IRR assessment, measurement and management practices consistent with OCC guidelines. Management believes ASB’s IRR processes are aligned with the Interagency Advisory on Interest Rate Risk Management and appropriate with earnings and capital levels, balance sheet complexity, business model and risk tolerance.
Liquidity.  OCC regulations require ASB to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. ASB’s principal sources of liquidity are customer deposits, borrowings, the maturity and repayment of portfolio loans and securities and the sale of loans into secondary market channels. ASB’s principal sources of borrowings are advances from the FHLB of Des Moines and securities sold under agreements to repurchase from broker/dealers. ASB is approved by the FHLB of Des Moines to borrow an amount of up to 35% of assets to the extent it provides qualifying collateral and holds sufficient FHLB of Des Moines stock. As of December 31, 2017, ASB’s unused FHLB of Des Moines borrowing capacity was approximately $1.8 billion. ASB utilizes growth in deposits, advances from the FHLB of Des Moines and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to fund maturing and withdrawable deposits, repay maturing borrowings, fund existing and future loans and make investments. As of December 31, 2017, ASB had loan commitments, undisbursed loan funds and unused lines and letters of credit of $1.8 billion. Management believes ASB’s current sources of funds will enable it to meet these obligations while maintaining liquidity at satisfactory levels.
Supervision. Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the FDICIA), the federal banking agencies promulgated regulations which apply to the operations of ASB and its holding companies. Such regulations address, for example, standards for safety and soundness, real estate lending, accounting and reporting, transactions with affiliates and loans to insiders.
24

Prompt corrective action.  The FDICIA establishes a statutory framework that is triggered by the capital level of a financial institution and subjects it to progressively more stringent restrictions and supervision as capital levels decline. The OCC rules implement the system of prompt corrective action. In particular, the rules define the relevant capital measures for the categories of “well capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.”
A financial institution that is “undercapitalized” or “significantly undercapitalized” is subject to additional mandatory supervisory actions and a number of discretionary actions if the OCC determines that any of the actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the association at the least possible long-term cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund. A financial institution that is “critically undercapitalized” must be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90 days, unless the OCC and the FDIC concur that other action would be more appropriate. As of December 31, 2017, ASB was “well-capitalized.”
Interest rates.  FDIC regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that are undercapitalized to offer interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions. As of December 31, 2017, ASB was “well capitalized” and thus not subject to these interest rate restrictions.
Qualified thrift lender test.  In order to satisfy the QTL test, ASB must maintain 65% of its assets in “qualified thrift investments” on a monthly average basis in 9 out of the previous 12 months. Failure to satisfy the QTL test would subject ASB to various penalties, including limitations on its activities, and would also bring into operation restrictions on the activities that may be engaged in by HEI, ASB Hawaii and their other subsidiaries, which could effectively result in the required divestiture of ASB. At all times during 2017, ASB was in compliance with the QTL test. See “HEI Consolidated–Regulation.”
Federal Home Loan Bank System.  ASB is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 11 regional FHLBs, and ASB’s regional bank is the FHLB of Des Moines. The FHLB System provides a central credit facility for member institutions. Historically, the FHLBs have served as the central liquidity facilities for savings associations and sources of long-term funds for financing housing. At such time as an advance is made to ASB or renewed, it must be collateralized by collateral from one of the following categories: (1) fully disbursed, whole first mortgages on improved residential property, or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages; (2) securities issued, insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any agency thereof; (3) FHLB deposits; and (4) other real estate-related collateral that has a readily ascertainable value and with respect to which a security interest can be perfected. The aggregate amount of outstanding advances collateralized by such other real estate-related collateral may not exceed 300% of ASB’s capital.
As mandated by the Gramm Act, the Federal Housing Finance Board (Board) regulations require each FHLB to maintain three capital ratios: (1) risk-based capital greater than or equal to the sum of its credit, market and operational risk capital requirements; (2) a minimum capital-to-assets ratio of 4%; and (3) a minimum total capital leverage ratio of 5% of total assets. At September 30, 2017, the FHLB of Des Moines was in compliance with all three of the regulatory capital requirements. ASB's required holding in the stock of the FHLB is both membership and activity-based. Membership is based on a percentage of total assets (0.12%) while the portion related to activity is based on a percentage of outstanding activity, mainly advances (4%). As of December 31, 2017, ASB was required and owned capital stock in the FHLB of Des Moines in the amount of $10 million. See “Stock in FHLB” in HEI’s MD&A section for recent developments regarding the FHLB of Des Moines.
Community Reinvestment.  The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requires financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income areas, consistent with safe and sound lending practices. The OCC will consider ASB’s CRA record in evaluating an application for a new deposit facility, including the establishment of a branch, the relocation of a branch or office, or the acquisition of an interest in another bank. ASB currently holds an “outstanding” CRA rating.
Other laws.  ASB is subject to federal and state consumer protection laws which affect deposit and lending activities, such as the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), the Truth in Savings Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and several federal and state financial privacy acts intended to protect consumers’ personal information and prevent identity theft, such as the Gramm Act and the Fair and Accurate Transactions Act. ASB is also subject to federal laws regulating certain of its lending practices, such as the Flood Disaster Protection Act, and laws requiring reports to regulators of certain customer transactions, such as the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act. ASB’s relationship with Cetera Investment Services LLC and Cetera Investment Advisers LLC is also governed by regulations adopted by the FRB under the Gramm Act, which regulate “networking” relationships under which a financial institution refers customers to a broker-dealer for securities services and employees of the financial institution are permitted to receive a nominal fee for the referrals. These laws may provide for substantial penalties in the event of noncompliance.
The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule became effective on October 3, 2015. The rule requires easier-to-use mortgage disclosure forms that clearly lay out the terms of a mortgage for a homebuyer. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
25

and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd Frank Act) mandated that the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the Bureau) establish a single disclosure scheme for use by lenders and creditors in complying with the disclosure requirements of both RESPA and TILA. The Dodd-Frank Act amended RESPA to require that the Bureau publish a single, integrated disclosure for mortgage loan transactions. The first new form - the Loan Estimate - is designed to provide disclosures that will be helpful to consumers in understanding the key features, costs, and risks of the mortgage for which they are applying. This form is provided to consumers within three business days after they submit a loan application. The second form - the Closing Disclosure - is designed to provide disclosures that will be helpful to consumers in understanding all of the costs of the transaction. This form is provided to consumers three business days before they close on the loan. The rule applies to most closed-end consumer mortgages.
ASB believes that it currently is in compliance with these laws and regulations in all material respects.
Proposed legislation.  See the discussion of proposed legislation in “Bank–Legislation and regulation” in HEI’s MD&A.
Environmental regulation.  ASB may be subject to the provisions of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), Hawaii Environmental Response Law (ERL) and regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose liability for environmental cleanup costs on certain categories of responsible parties. CERCLA and ERL exempt persons whose ownership in a facility is held primarily to protect a security interest, provided that they do not participate in the management of the facility. Although there may be some risk of liability for ASB for environmental cleanup costs in the event ASB forecloses on, and becomes the owner of, property with environmental problems, the Company believes the risk is not as great for ASB as it may be for other depository institutions that have a larger portfolio of commercial loans.
Additional information.  For additional information about ASB, see the sections under “Bank” in HEI’s MD&A, HEI’s “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” and HEI's Consolidated Financial Statements, including Note 4 thereto.
Properties.  ASB owns or leases several office buildings in downtown Honolulu, owns land and an operations center in the Mililani Technology Park on the island of Oahu and owns land on which a number of its branches are located.
The following table sets forth the number of bank branches owned and leased by ASB by island:

 | Number of branches
December 31, 2017 | Owned | Leased | | Total

Maui | 3 | | 3 | | 6 
Hawaii | 3 | | 2 | | 5 
Kauai | 2 | | 1 | | 3 
Molokai | — | | 1 | | 1

During 2017, two branches were closed on Oahu and one branch on Maui. ASB had other branches in close proximity to the closed branches and customer accounts were consolidated into those branches.
As of December 31, 2017, the net book value (NBV) of branches and office facilities was $75 million ($68 million NBV of the land and improvements for the branches and office facilities owned by ASB and $7 million represents the NBV of ASB’s leasehold improvements) compared to the NBV of branches and office facilities of $68 million ($62 million NBV of the land and improvements for the branches and office facilities owned by ASB and $6 million represents the NBV of ASB’s leasehold improvements) as of December 31, 2016. The leases expire on various dates through February 2033, but many of the leases have extension provisions.
As of December 31, 2017, ASB owned 113 automated teller machines.
Construction of New Headquarters. In the first quarter of 2017, ASB began construction of its new headquarters in downtown Honolulu. The project will cost an estimated $100 million and is expected to take twenty months to complete. The headquarters will have approximately 370,000 square feet of space on eleven floors and consolidate five separate offices into one building where approximately 600 employees will work.
