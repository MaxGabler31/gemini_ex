We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

GENERAL

Anvi Global Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 15, 2012 and established a fiscal year end of February 28. We formed the Company to commence operations in the business of selling crepes; however, we abandoned that business when control of the Company was sold by Tatiana Fumioka, on May 6, 2014. As a result, we are now controlled by Rama Mohan R. Busa, the principal shareholder and sole officer and director.

On May 24, 2018, as reported in a Form 8-K filed that same day, we entered into a Memorandum of Business Association (MOA) with Team Universal Infratech Pvt. Ltd (TUI), pursuant to which TUI, a 12-year old Indian infrastructure development company based in Hyderabad, agreed to enter into a Joint Venture (the JV) with the Registrant, to execute the projects TUI is currently holding (as mentioned below), and also which may include TUIs future projects which are in the pipeline. The Registrant and TUI have agreed and proposed to create a legally valid joint venture entity (JV), with the Registrant having majority control of the JV stock and control of all operations of the specified projects which are executed pursuant to the JV.

The basic terms of the MOA are as follows:

1.
 TUI was awarded and currently holds the contract by the Airport Authority of India, an Indian Government organization, to construct a 400 meter (approximately 440 yards) long and 120 meter (approximately 130 yards) wide apron for aircraft and related pavement, at the CCC International Airport in Lucknow, India (the First Project).

2.
 TUI was also awarded and currently holds the contract by the National Highway authority of India, an Indian Government organization to construct NH-24, a 4-lane bypass starting from km 479.500 of NH 24 and terminating at km 17.600 of MDR- 77C (bypass chainage from km 64.900/64.380 to km 79.516/79.000 total length 14.618 kilometersapproximately 9.14 miles) in the State of Uttar Pradesh, India under NHDP Phase-VII on EPC Mode.

3.
 The total cost of the proposed projects is estimated at $58.00 million, and the investment for the successful completion of the project(s) is estimated to be $12.00+ Million. 

4.
 TUI and Registrant propose to jointly execute the specified projects under a legally constituted (JV). TUI, with its expertise and experience in the field, will be responsible for operations by providing technology, technical teams, deployment of equipment and skilled manpower. The Registrant is responsible to provide the capital expenditures and operating expenses required from now on, which is estimated to be approximately $6.00 Million for successful completion of the specified projects. 

5.
 TUI has already invested its share, which is approximately $6.00+ millions, through various heads-like acquisitions of the project(s), including the open tender process by the respective government bodies, earnest money deposits, performance guarantees, bank guarantees, deployment of equipment, technical teams, preparation of camp office, etc.

6.
 The Registrants responsibility is to raise approximately $6.00 Million in two phases: $3.00 million within sixty days and the remaining $3.00 Million within 120 days from the date of this MOA. However, the period may be extended upon terms agreed to by both parties, and will then be added as addendum to the MOA.

7.
 Assuming that the Registrant secures the required funding within the above time frames, which it intends to do in a debt offering, TUI will transfer the specified projects pursuant to subcontracts with the JV, to be legally created by both parties at that time, and the Registrant will then own small majority of the JV.

8.
 Assuming that the Registrant raises the required funds within the specified time, the Registrant believes that it will realize revenues from Joint Venture to be legally created by both parties in which Registrant has majority stock and through which specified projects are executed and revenues are realized.

9.
 The MOA with TUI also includes future projects in the pipeline being awarded to TUI, for which the financial requirements are being estimated.

The Registrant is now concentrating its efforts toward raising the debt financing required to fund the specified Projects.

As a result of entering into the MOA described in this Item 1, the Registrant is executing its business plan, and is no longer a shell, as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
