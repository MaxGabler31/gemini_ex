Market Area 
 Our primary lending area encompasses a broad market that includes Northeastern Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire, with a focus on Essex County, Massachusetts, and Hillsborough and Rockingham Counties, New Hampshire, which are part of, and bedroom communities to, the technology corridor between Boston, Massachusetts and Concord, New Hampshire. In 2018, we started offering our small business merger and acquisition, re-capitalization, and shareholder/partner buyout loan product nationally. Our primary deposit-gathering area is currently concentrated in Essex County, Massachusetts, and Rockingham County and Hillsborough County, New Hampshire. 
 The greater Boston metropolitan area is the 10th largest metropolitan area in the United States. Located adjacent to major transportation corridors, the Boston metropolitan area provides a highly diversified economic base, with major employment sectors ranging from services, manufacturing and wholesale and retail trade, to finance, technology and medical care. The largest employment sectors are, however, education, healthcare and social services, accounting for 28.0% of jobs in Massachusetts as of December 31, 2018. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor, the unemployment rate for Massachusetts was 2.7% in December 2018 compared to 3.1% in December 2017, and 3.7% for the United States as a whole for December 2018. The population in Massachusetts grew 4.6% from 2011 to 2018, while the national population and the population in Essex County, Massachusetts grew 5.1% and 6.5%, respectively, over the same time period. Median household income in Massachusetts was $77,248 for 2018, compared to $61,045 and $74,525 for the nation and Essex County, respectively.
 New Hampshire also provides a highly diversified economic base, with major employment sectors ranging from services and manufacturing to finance/insurance/real estate, but the largest employment sector is education, healthcare and social services. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor, the unemployment rate for New Hampshire was 2.1% in December 2018 compared to 2.3% in December 2017. The population in New Hampshire grew 1.4% from 2011 to 2018, while the population in Hillsborough and Rockingham Counties, New Hampshire grew 0.9% and 1.9%, respectively, over the same time period. Median household income in New Hampshire was $75,742 for 2018, compared to $80,246 and $95,662 for Hillsborough and Rockingham Counties, respectively. 
 Competition 
 We face significant competition for deposits and loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the many financial institutions operating in our market area. Several large holding companies operate banks in our market area. Many of these institutions, such as TD Bank, Bank of America and Citizens Bank, are significantly larger than us and, therefore, have greater resources. Additionally, some of our competitors offer products and services that we do not offer, such as insurance services, trust services, and wealth management. We also face competition for investors’ funds from other

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 financial service companies such as brokerage firms, fintech companies, money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. Based on data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as of June 30, 2018 (the latest date for which information is available), The Provident Bank had 1.76% of the deposit market share within Essex County, Massachusetts, giving us the 14th largest market share out of 35 financial institutions with offices in that county as of that date and had 3.45% of the deposit market share within Rockingham County, New Hampshire, giving us the 8th largest market share out of 26 financial institutions with offices in that county as of that date. This data excludes deposits held by credit unions. 
 Our competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions in our market area. Our experience in recent years is that many financial institutions in our market area, especially community banks that are seeking to significantly expand their commercial loan portfolios and banks located in lower growth regions in New Hampshire and Maine, have been willing to price commercial loans aggressively in order to gain market share. 
 Lending Activities 
  Commercial Real Estate Loans.   At December 31, 2018, commercial real estate loans were $364.9 million, or 43.0%, of our total loan portfolio. This amount includes $32.0 million of multi-family residential real estate loans, which we consider a subset of commercial real estate loans, and which are described below. Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by properties used for business purposes such as office buildings, industrial facilities and retail facilities; however, we also originate loans secured by investment real estate in the form of residential rental units. At December 31, 2018, $158.3 million of our commercial real estate portfolio was secured by owner occupied commercial real estate, and $206.6 million was secured by income producing, or non-owner occupied commercial real estate. We currently target new commercial real estate loan originations to experienced, growing small- and mid-size owners and investors in our market area. The average outstanding loan in our commercial real estate portfolio was $498,000 as of December 31, 2018, although we originate commercial real estate loans with balances significantly larger than this average. At December 31, 2018, our ten largest commercial real estate loans had an average balance of $6.0 million. 
 We focus our commercial real estate lending on properties within our primary market areas, but we will originate commercial real estate loans on properties located outside this area based on an established relationship with a strong borrower. We intend to continue to grow our commercial real estate loan portfolio while maintaining prudent underwriting standards. In addition to originating these loans, we occasionally will participate in commercial real estate loans with other financial institutions. Such participations are underwritten in accordance with our policies before we will participate in such loans. 
 We originate a variety of fixed- and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans with terms and amortization periods generally up to 20 years, which may include balloon loans. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans adjust every three, five or seven years and generally are indexed to the corresponding Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing rate plus a margin. Most of our adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans adjust every five years and amortize over terms of 20 years. We generally include pre-payment penalties on commercial real estate loans we originate. Commercial real estate loan amounts do not exceed 75% to 80% of the property’s appraised value at the time the loan is originated. In addition, debt service ratios, by policy, are required to have a minimum net operating income to debt service coverage ratio ranging from of 1.10x to 1.25x based on loan type and the defined and approved term/​amortization. For commercial real estate loans in excess of $500,000, we require independent appraisals from an approved appraisers list. For such loans below $500,000, we require real estate evaluations but do not require an independent appraisal. We require commercial real estate loan borrowers with loan relationships in excess of $1.0 million to submit annual financial statements and/or rent rolls on the subject property, although we may request such information for smaller loans on a case-by-case basis. Loans below the $1.0 million threshold are reviewed annually using business and consumer credit reports, payment history, and confirmation of real estate tax payments. Commercial real estate properties may also be subject to annual inspections to support that appropriate maintenance is being performed by the owner/borrower. The loan and its borrowers and/or guarantors are subject to an annual risk certification verifying that the loan is properly risk rated based upon covenant compliance (as applicable) and other terms as provided for in the loan agreements. While this process does not prevent loans from becoming delinquent, it provides us

 with the opportunity to better identify problem loans in a timely manner and to work with the borrower prior to the loan becoming delinquent. 
 The following table provides information with respect to our commercial real estate loans by type at December 31, 2018. The table excludes multi-family residential real estate loans, discussed below.

 If we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be lengthy with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial. 
 Our largest single commercial real estate loan at December 31, 2018 totaled $7.3 million, was originated in November 2014 and is secured by non-owner occupied commercial use property. Our next largest commercial real estate loan at December 31, 2018 was for $7.2 million, was originated in December 2013 and is secured by non-owner occupied commercial use property. The third largest commercial real estate loan was for $6.7 million, was originated in September 2017 and is secured by non-owner occupied commercial use property. All of the collateral securing these loans is all located in our primary lending area. At December 31, 2018, all of these loans were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms. 
  Multi-Family Residential Real Estate Loans.   At December 31, 2018, multi-family real estate loans were $32.0 million, or 3.8% of our total loan portfolio. We do not focus on the origination of multi-family real estate lending, but we will originate these loans to well-qualified borrowers when opportunities exist that meet our underwriting standards. We currently originate new individual multi-family real estate loans to experienced, growing small- and mid-size owners and investors in our market area. Our multi-family real estate loans are generally secured by properties consisting of five to 15 rental units. The average outstanding loan size in our multi-family real estate portfolio was $438,000 as of December 31, 2018. We generally do not make multi-family real estate loans outside our primary market areas. In addition to originating these loans, we also participate in multi-family residential real estate loans with other financial institutions. Such participations are underwritten in accordance with our policies before we will participate in such loans. 
 We originate a variety of fixed-and adjustable-rate multi-family real estate loans for terms up to 30 years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans adjust every three, five or seven years and generally are indexed to the corresponding Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing rate plus a margin. Most of our adjustable-rate multi-family real estate loans adjust every five years and amortize over terms of 20 to 25 years. We also include pre-payment penalties on loans we originate. Multi-family real estate loan amounts do not exceed 80% of the property’s appraised value at the time the loan is originated. Debt service ratios, by policy, are required to have a minimum net operating income to debt service coverage ratio of 1.20x. We require multi-family real estate loan borrowers with loan relationships in excess of $1.0 million to

 submit annual financial statements and/or rent rolls on the subject property, although we may request such information for smaller loans on a case-by-case basis. Loans below the $1.0 million threshold are reviewed annually using business and consumer credit reports, payment history, and confirmation of real estate tax payments. These properties may also be subject to annual inspections to support that appropriate maintenance is being performed by the owner/borrower. 
 If we foreclose on a multi-family real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be lengthy with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial. 
 Our largest multi-family real estate loan at December 31, 2018 totaled $4.6 million, was originated in September 2016 and is secured by a multi-family property. At December 31, 2018, this loan was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms. 
  Commercial Business Loans.   We make commercial business loans primarily in our market area to a variety of small and medium sized businesses, including professional and nonprofit organizations, and, to a lesser extent, sole proprietorships. These loans are generally secured by business assets, and we may support this collateral with junior liens on real property. At December 31, 2018, commercial business loans were $361.8 million, or 42.6% of our total loan portfolio, and we intend to increase the amount of commercial business loans that we originate. As part of our relationship driven focus, we encourage our commercial business borrowers to maintain their primary deposit accounts with us, which enhances our interest rate spread and overall profitability. 
 Commercial lending products include term loans and revolving lines of credit. Commercial loans and lines of credit are made with either variable or fixed rates of interest. Variable rates and rates on Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans are based on the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. Initial rates on non-SBA fixed-rate business loans are generally based on a corresponding Federal Home Loan Bank rate, plus a margin. Commercial business loans typically have shorter maturity terms and higher interest rates than commercial real estate loans, but may involve more credit risk because of the type and nature of the collateral. We are focusing our efforts on originating such loans to experienced, growing small- to medium-sized, privately-held companies with local or regional businesses and non-profit entities that operate in our market area. 
 When making commercial loans, we consider the financial statements of the borrower, our lending history with the borrower, the debt service capabilities and global cash flows of the borrower and other guarantors, the projected cash flows of the business and the value of the collateral, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Depending on the collateral used to secure the loans, commercial loans are made in amounts of up to 80% of the value of the collateral securing the loan. All of these loans are secured by assets of the respective borrowers. 
 A portion of our commercial business loans are guaranteed by the SBA through the SBA 7(a) loan program. The SBA 7(a) loan program supports, through a U.S. Government guarantee, some portion of the traditional commercial loan underwriting that might not be fully covered absent the guarantee. A typical example would be a business acquiring another business, where the value purchased is an enterprise value (as opposed to tangible assets), which results in a collateral shortfall under traditional loan underwriting requirements. In addition, SBA 7(a) loans, through term loans, can provide a good source of permanent working capital for growing companies. The Provident Bank is a Preferred Lender under the SBA’s PLP Program, which allows expedited underwriting and approval of SBA 7(a) loans. 
 We joined the BancAlliance network in May 2011. BancAlliance has a membership of approximately 200 community banks that together participate in middle market commercial and industrial loans as a way to diversify their commercial portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, we had $14.8 million of outstanding commercial business loans that were originated through this network. All of these loans are participations in a larger facility agented by capital finance companies. We fully underwrite these loans in accordance with our policies prior to approval. At December 31, 2018, loans totaling, $917,000 were on non-accrual status. The remaining loans totaling $13.9 million were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 In 2015, we started originating merger and acquisition, re-capitalization, and shareholder/partnerbuyout loans to small- and medium-size businesses in a senior secured position; relying largely on the enterprise value of the business and ongoing cash flow to support operational and debt service requirements. The average term for these enterprise value loans is approximately seven years with material levels of equity and/or combination of seller financing behind our senior secured lending. In underwriting these loans we generally require minimum fixed charge coverage ratios of 1.20x to 1.50x, maximum senior leverage of 3.0x and maximum total leverage of 5.0x. The maximum senior loan-to-enterprise value must be 65% or lower. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of $138.8 million in senior secured cash flow loans, excluding BancAlliance loans. The largest loan was $15.0 million and is secured by all business assets. At December 31, 2018, the loan was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms. 
 In 2015, we started originating renewable energy loans primarily, in New England and New York. Our renewable energy loans primarily include loans secured by solar arrays and wind turbines. The average term and amortization for these loans can extend to 15 years or more, given the asset life, and are generally underwritten to a maximum term of two years less than the associated Power Purchase Agreement (“PPA”) supporting the repayment of each loan. Generally, the underwriting criteria includes: a report supporting the power generation capacity and ultimately the ability to generate sufficient cash flows, assignment of the associated PPA, analysis on the quality of the power off-taker, an overall business valuation, and appropriate loan covenants, which may include maximum loan-to-value and minimum debt service coverage requirements. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of $50.4 million in renewable energy loans. At December 31, 2018, $35.7 million, or 70.9%, of our renewable energy loans was secured by solar arrays, and $14.7 million, or 29.1%, were secured by wind turbines. The largest loan was $7.9 million and is secured by all business assets of the company, including the solar array and an assignment of the PPA. At December 31, 2018, the loan was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms. 
 Our largest commercial business loan at December 31, 2018 totaled $15.0 million, was originated in 2018 and is secured by all business assets. Our next largest commercial business loan totaled $9.3 million, was originated in 2018 and is secured by all business assets. The third largest commercial totaled $8.0 million, was originated in 2018 and is secured by all business assets. As of December 31, 2018, the loans were performing in accordance with the original repayment terms. 
  Construction and Land Development Loans.   At December 31, 2018, construction and land development loans were $44.6 million, or 5.3% of our total loan portfolio, consisting of $21.4 million of one- to four-family residential and condominium construction loans, $728,000 of residential land or development loans, and $22.5 million of commercial and multi-family real estate construction loans. At December 31, 2018, $24.3 million of our commercial and multi-family real estate construction loans are expected to convert to permanent loans upon completion of the construction phase. The majority of the balance of these loans is secured by properties located in our primary lending area.
 We primarily make construction loans for commercial development projects, including hotels, condominiums and single family residences, small industrial buildings, retail and office buildings and apartment buildings. Most of our construction loans are interest-only loans that provide for the payment of interest during the construction phase, which is usually up to 12 to 24 months, although some construction loans are renewed, generally for one or two additional years. At the end of the construction phase, the loan may convert to a permanent mortgage loan or the loan may be paid in full. Loans generally can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% of the appraised market value upon completion of the project. As appropriate to the underwriting, a discounted cash flow analysis is utilized. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser for construction and land development loans in excess of $500,000. We also will generally require an inspection of the property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. 
 We also originate construction and site development loans to contractors and builders to finance the construction of single-family homes and subdivisions. While we may originate these loans whether or not the collateral property underlying the loan is under contract for sale, we consider each project carefully in light of current residential real estate market conditions. We actively monitor the number of unsold homes in our construction loan portfolio and local housing markets to attempt to maintain an appropriate balance

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 between home sales and new loan originations. We generally will limit the maximum number of speculative units (units that are not pre-sold) approved for each builder to two units. We have attempted to diversify the risk associated with speculative construction lending by doing business with experienced small and mid-sized builders within our market area. 
 Residential real estate construction loans include single-family tract construction loans for the construction of entry level residential homes. The maximum loan-to-value limit applicable to these loans is generally 75% to 80% of the appraised market value upon completion of the project. Development plans are required from builders prior to making the loan. Our loan officers are required to personally visit the proposed site of the development and the sites of competing developments. We require that builders maintain adequate insurance coverage. While maturity dates for residential construction loans are largely a function of the estimated construction period of the project, and generally do not exceed one year, land development loans generally are for 18 to 24 months. Substantially all of our residential construction loans have adjustable rates of interest based on The Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a margin. Construction loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspection by our approved inspectors warrant. 
 Our largest construction and land development loan at December 31, 2018 totaled $5.8 million, was originated in 2015 and is secured by non-owner occupied commercial use property. At December 31, 2018, this loan was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms. 
  One- to Four-Family Residential Loans.   Our one- to four-family residential loan portfolio consists of mortgage loans that enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes, most of which serve as the primary residence of the owner. At December 31, 2018, one- to four-family residential real estate loans were $57.4 million, or 6.8% of our total loan portfolio, consisting of $36.2 million of fixed-rate loans and $21.2 million of adjustable-rate loans, respectively. This amount includes $20.7 million of home equity loans and lines of credit, which we consider a subset of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and which are described below. 
 We discontinued this type of lending in 2014 to focus on commercial loan originations. Accordingly, we expect our portfolio of one- to four-family residential real estate loans to decrease over time due to normal amortization and repayments. Our one- to four-family residential real estate loans generally do not have prepayment penalties. 
  Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit.   At December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance owed on home equity loans was $673,000, or 0.1% of our total loan portfolio, and the outstanding balance owed on home equity lines of credit amounted to $20.0 million, or 2.4% of our total loan portfolio. We discontinued home equity loan originations in 2014 to focus on commercial loan originations, but we continue to offer home equity lines of credit. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest with ten-year draws and terms of 15 years that are indexed to the prime rate as published by The Wall Street Journal on the last business day of the month. We offer home equity lines of credit with cumulative loan-to-value ratios generally up to 80%, when taking into account both the balance of the home equity line of credit and first mortgage loan.
  Consumer Loans.   We offer loans secured by certificate accounts and overdraft lines of credit. At December 31, 2018, consumer loans were $19.8 million, or 2.3% of total loans. The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. 
 In 2016, we entered into an agreement to purchase pools of unsecured consumer loans through the BancAlliance Lending Club Program. This program encompasses loans risk graded by Lending Club A through C with a 680 minimum credit score, out of a possible risk grade of A through G. The Lending Club retains the servicing of these loans. As of December 31, 2018, we had $19.0 million in outstanding consumer loans that were purchased through this program. 
 Loan Underwriting Risks 
  Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Loans.   Loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. In addition, many of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with

 us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Of primary concern in commercial and multi-family real estate lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income producing properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than residential real estate loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income producing properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide annual financial statements on commercial and multi-family real estate loans. In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial or multi-family real estate loan, we consider and review a global cash flow analysis of the borrower and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability and the value of the underlying property. We have generally required that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.20x. An environmental phase one report is obtained when the possibility exists that hazardous materials may have existed on the site, or the site may have been impacted by adjoining properties that handled hazardous materials. 
  Construction and Land Development Loans.   Our construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the completed project. Underwriting is focused on the borrowers’ financial strength, credit history and demonstrated ability to produce a quality product and effectively market and manage their operations. All construction loans for which the builder does not have a binding purchase agreement must be approved by senior loan officers. 
 Construction lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent residential lending because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. This type of lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. In addition, generally during the term of a construction loan, interest may be funded by the borrower or disbursed from an interest reserve set aside from the construction loan budget. These loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the appraised value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. A discounted cash flow analysis is utilized for determining the value of any construction project of five or more units. Our ability to continue to originate a significant amount of construction loans is dependent on the strength of the housing market in our market areas. 
 Land loans secured by improved lots generally involve greater risks than residential mortgage lending because land loans are more difficult to evaluate. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, in the event of default and foreclosure, we may be confronted with a property the value of which is insufficient to assure full payment. 
  Commercial Business Loans.   Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our commercial business loans are originated primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral consists of accounts receivable, inventory or equipment, the value of which may depreciate over time, may be more difficult to appraise and may be more susceptible to fluctuation in value. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Adjustable-Rate Loans.   While we anticipate that adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate loans, an increased monthly mortgage payment required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits on residential loans. 
  Consumer Loans.   Consumer loans may entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as motor vehicles. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and a small remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans. 
Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales 
 Loan originations come from a variety of sources. The primary sources of loan originations are current customers, business development by our relationship managers, walk-in traffic, our website, networking events and referrals from customers as well as our directors, trustees and corporators, business owners, investors, entrepreneurs, builders, realtors, and other professional third parties, including brokers. Loan originations are further supported by lending services offered through cross-selling and employees’ community service. 
 Historically, we generally originated loans for our portfolio. We occasionally sell participation interests in commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans to local financial institutions, primarily on the portion of loans exceeding our borrowing limits. At December 31, 2018, we were servicing $20.4 million of commercial real estate and commercial business loans where we had sold an interest to local financial institutions. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we sold loan participations of $11.8 million and $3.0 million, respectively. 
 While we generally do not purchase whole loans, we will occassionally purchase loan participations from other financial institutions or through the BancAlliance program. We will also purchase pools of unsecured consumer loans through the BancAlliance Lending Club Program, described above. As of December 31, 2018, we had $14.8 million of outstanding commercial business loans and $19.0 million of outstanding consumer loans that were originated through the BancAlliance program and BancAlliance Lending Club program, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had no loan participation purchases, and during the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased $4.2 million of loan participations.
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 
 Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by The Provident Bank’s board of directors and management. The Provident Bank’s board of directors has granted loan approval authority to certain officers up to prescribed limits, depending on the officer’s experience, the type of loan and whether the loan is secured or unsecured. All loans require the approval of a minimum of two lending officers, one of which must be a Senior Vice President or above (the exception is borrowing relationships of $25,000 and below, which can be approved by one officer with sufficient authority for that loan type, as well as, loans of any amount which are 100% cash secured). For loan relationships below $2.0 million, approval is required by designated individuals with delegated loan authority as identified within Loan Policy. Our loan policy dictates that for loan relationships of between $2.0 million and $3.0 million approval is required by two of the following members of Credit Committee: Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and/or President/Chief Lending Officer. While our loan policy dictates that loan relationships greater than $3.0 million be presented to and approved by Credit Committee; our practice has been to present loan relationships greater than $2.0 million to Credit

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Committee for review and formal approval. Loans that involve exceptions to policy, including loans in excess of our internal loans-to-one borrower limitation, must be authorized by The Provident Bank’s Risk Committee of the board of directors. Exceptions are fully disclosed to the approving authority, either an individual officer or the appropriate management or board committee prior to commitment. Exceptions are reported to the board of directors quarterly. 
Loans-to-One Borrower Limit and Loan Category Concentration 
 The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities is generally limited, by statute, to 20% of our capital, which is defined under Massachusetts law as the sum of our capital stock, surplus account and undivided profits. At December 31, 2018, our regulatory limit on loans-to-one borrower was $25.8 million. We generally establish our internal loans-to-one borrower limit as 90% of our regulatory limit. As of December 31, 2018, this amount was $23.2 million, with loans greater than this amount requiring approval by The Provident Bank’s Risk Committee of the board of directors. 
 At December 31, 2018, our largest lending relationship consisted of nine loans with a total exposure of $21.2 million, secured by non-owner occupied investment real estate. This relationship was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms at December 31, 2018. Our second largest lending relationship consisted of 16 loans with a total exposure of $21.0 million, secured by business assets. This relationship was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms at December 31, 2018. Our third largest lending relationship consisted of eight loans with a total exposure of $20.7 million, secured by all business assets. This relationship was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms at December 31, 2018. Our fourth largest lending relationship consisted of 22 loans with a total exposure of $18.9 million, secured by all business assets. This relationship was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms at December 31, 2018. Our fifth largest lending relationship consisted of nine loans with a total exposure of $17.7 million, secured by a non-owner occupied commercial use property. This relationship was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms at December 31, 2018. 
 Investment Activities 
 We have legal authority to invest in various types of investment securities and liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises, residential mortgage-backed securities and municipal government bonds, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, investment grade corporate bonds and investment grade marketable equity securities, including common stock and money market mutual funds. We also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock, which investment is based on the level of our Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. While we have the authority under applicable law to invest in derivative securities, we had no investments in derivative securities at December 31, 2018.
 At December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio had a fair value of $51.4 million, and consisted primarily of U.S. Government Agency mortgage-backed securities, and state and municipal bonds. Effective January 2018, the Company adopted ASU (Accounting Standards Update) No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10): “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” This standard required us to measure our equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. We evaluated the pronouncement and decided to divest from our equity securities portfolio in 2017 to reduce potential volatility within our earnings performance. 
 Our investment objectives are to provide and maintain liquidity, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, to provide a use of funds when demand for loans is weak and to generate a favorable return. Our board of directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of our investment policy. The Risk Committee of the board of directors and management are responsible for implementation of the investment policy and monitoring our investment performance. Our Risk Committee reviews the status of our investment portfolio quarterly. 
 Each reporting period, we evaluate all securities with a decline in fair value below the amortized cost of the investment to determine whether or not the impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired (“OTTI”). OTTI is required to be recognized if (1) we intend to sell the security; (2) it is more 

 11

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) for debt securities, the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. Marketable equity securities are evaluated for OTTI based on the severity and duration of the impairment and, if deemed to be other than temporary, the declines in fair value are reflected in earnings as realized losses. For impaired debt securities that we intend to sell, or more likely than not will be required to sell, the full amount of the depreciation is recognized as OTTI resulting in a realized loss that is a charged to earnings through a reduction in our noninterest income. For all other impaired debt securities, credit-related OTTI is recognized through earnings and non-credit related OTTI is recognized in other comprehensive income/loss, net of applicable taxes. We did not recognize any OTTI during the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017. 
Sources of Funds 
  General.   Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston advances, brokered deposits and certificates of deposit obtained from a national exchange, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, funds are derived from scheduled loan payments, investment securities maturities and sales, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 
  Deposit Accounts.   The majority of our deposits (other than certificates of deposit) are from depositors who reside in our primary market areas. However, a significant portion of our brokered certificates of deposits and QwickRate deposits, described below, are from depositors located outside our primary market areas. Deposits are attracted through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including noninterest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts), savings accounts and certificates of deposit. In addition to accounts for individuals, we also offer several commercial checking accounts designed for the businesses operating in our market area, and we encourage our commercial borrowing customers to maintain their deposit relationships with us. At December 31, 2018, our deposits totaled $768.1 million. As of that date, our certificates of deposit included $55.8 million of brokered certificates of deposit and $5.2 million of QwickRate certificates of deposit, where we gather certificates of deposit nationwide by posting rates we will pay on these deposits. At December 31, 2018, all of our QwickRate certificates of deposit were in amounts greater than $100,000.
 Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time period that funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability, and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing on a weekly basis. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates and services and to periodically offer special rates in order to attract deposits of a specific type or term, although we have not done so in recent periods. We do not price our deposit products to be among the highest rate paying institution in our market area, but instead focus on services to gather deposits. 
  Borrowings.   We primarily utilize advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston to supplement our supply of investable funds. The Federal Home Loan Bank functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for its member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our whole first mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution’s net worth or on the Federal Home Loan Bank’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2018, we had $133.0 million of available borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, including an available line of credit of $2.0 million at an interest rate that adjusts daily. On that date, we had $59.9 million in advances outstanding from the

 Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. All of our borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank are secured by investment securities and qualified collateral, including one- to four-family loans and multi-family and commercial real estate loans held in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, we also had $8.1 million in borrowings outstanding from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s borrower-in-custody program. All of our borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank borrower-in-custody program are secured by investment securities and qualified collateral, including commercial and commercial real estate loans held in our portfolio. 
Personnel 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 116 full-time and 16 part-time employees, none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe we have a good working relationship with our employees. 
Subsidiaries 
 The Provident Bank’s subsidiaries include Provident Security Corporation and 5 Market Street Security Corporation, which were established to buy, sell, and hold investments for their own account. 
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 General 
 The Provident Bank is a Massachusetts-chartered stock savings bank. The Provident Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and by the Depositors Insurance Fund for amounts in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. The Provident Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Provident Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. The Provident Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. 
 The regulation and supervision of The Provident Bank establish a framework of activities in which an institution can engage and are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and borrowers and, for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the protection of the insurance fund. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. 
 Provident Bancorp, Inc. and Provident Bancorp are required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. They are required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and are subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. Provident Bancorp, Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) made extensive changes in the regulation of depository institutions and their holding companies. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to delayed effective dates and/or still require the issuance of implementing regulations. Their impact on operations cannot yet be fully assessed. However, there is significant possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act will, at a minimum, result in increased regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense for The Provident Bank, Provident Bancorp, Inc. and Provident Bancorp. 
 Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of Provident Bancorp, Provident Bancorp, Inc. and The Provident Bank. In addition, 

 13

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Provident Bancorp, Provident Bancorp, Inc. and The Provident Bank are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve Board. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, it is impossible for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy or the effect of such changes on the business or financial condition of Provident Bancorp, Provident Bancorp, Inc. and The Provident Bank. 
 Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to The Provident Bank, Provident Bancorp, Inc. and Provident Bancorp. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on The Provident Bank, Provident Bancorp, Inc. and Provident Bancorp and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations.
 Massachusetts Banking Laws and Supervision 
 The Provident Bank, as a Massachusetts-chartered stock savings bank, is regulated and supervised by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required to regularly examine each state-chartered bank. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required to establish or close branches, to merge with another bank, to issue stock and to undertake many other activities. Any Massachusetts savings bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be sanctioned. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may suspend or remove directors or officers of a savings bank who have violated the law, conducted a bank’s business in a manner that is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors’ interests, or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks has the authority to appoint a receiver or conservator if it is determined that the bank is conducting its business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner, and under certain other circumstances. 
 The powers that Massachusetts-chartered savings banks can exercise under these laws include, but are not limited to, the following. 
  Lending Activities.   A Massachusetts-chartered savings bank may make a wide variety of mortgage loans including fixed-rate loans, adjustable-rate loans, variable-rate loans, participation loans, graduated payment loans, construction and development loans, condominium and co-operative loans, second mortgage loans and other types of loans that may be made in accordance with applicable regulations. Commercial loans may be made to corporations and other commercial enterprises with or without security. Consumer and personal loans may also be made with or without security. 
  Insurance Sales.   Massachusetts savings banks may engage in insurance sales activities if the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks has approved a plan of operation for insurance activities and the bank obtains a license from the Massachusetts Division of Insurance. A savings bank may be licensed directly or indirectly through an affiliate or a subsidiary corporation established for this purpose. Although The Provident Bank has received approval for insurance sales activities, it does not offer insurance products. 
  Investment Activities.   In general, Massachusetts-chartered savings banks may invest in preferred and common stock of any corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state provided such investments do not involve control of any corporation and do not, in the aggregate, exceed 4.0% of the bank’s deposits. Massachusetts-chartered savings banks may in addition invest an amount equal to 1.0% of their deposits in stocks of Massachusetts corporations or companies with substantial employment in the Commonwealth which have pledged to the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks that such monies will be used for further development within the Commonwealth. At the present time, The Provident Bank has the authority to invest in equity securities. However, such investment authority is constrained by federal law. See “— Federal Bank Regulation — Investment Activities” for such federal restrictions. 
  Dividends.   A Massachusetts stock bank may declare from net profits cash dividends not more frequently than quarterly and non-cash dividends at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited or paid if the bank’s capital stock is impaired. A Massachusetts savings bank with outstanding preferred stock may not, without the prior approval of the Commissioner of Banks, declare dividends to the common stock without also declaring dividends to the preferred stock. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net 

 14

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years, less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. Net profits for this purpose means the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets after deducting current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all federal and state taxes. 
  Protection of Personal Information.   Massachusetts has adopted regulatory requirements intended to protect personal information. The requirements are similar to existing federal laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, discussed below under “— Federal Bank Regulation — Privacy Regulations.” They require organizations to establish written information security programs to prevent identity theft. The Massachusetts regulation also contains technology system requirements, especially for the encryption of personal information sent over wireless or public networks or stored on portable devices. 
  Parity Approval.   A Massachusetts bank may, in accordance with Massachusetts law, exercise any power and engage in any activity that has been authorized for national banks, federal thrifts or state banks in a state other than Massachusetts, provided that the activity is permissible under applicable federal law and not specifically prohibited by Massachusetts law. Such powers and activities must be subject to the same limitations and restrictions imposed on the national bank, federal thrift or out-of-state bank that exercised the power or activity. A Massachusetts bank may exercise such powers, and engage in such activities by providing 30 days’ advanced written notice to the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. 
  Loans to One Borrower Limitations.   Massachusetts banking law grants broad lending authority. However, with certain limited exceptions, total obligations of one borrower to a bank may not exceed 20.0% of the total of the bank’s capital, which is defined under Massachusetts law as the sum of the bank’s capital stock, surplus account and undivided profits. 
  Loans to a Bank’s Insiders.   Massachusetts law provides that a Massachusetts financial institution shall comply with Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board, which generally requires that extensions of credit to insiders: 
 •

 be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and 
 ​
 •

 not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Massachusetts financial institution’s capital.
 ​
  Regulatory Enforcement Authority.   Any Massachusetts bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance, including seizure of the property and business of the bank and suspension or revocation of its charter. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the bank’s business in a manner which is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors interests or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, upon finding that a bank has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the bank concerned. Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to The Provident Bank permit private individual and class action law suits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damage and attorney’s fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes. 
  Depositors Insurance Fund.   All Massachusetts-chartered savings banks are required to be members of the Depositors Insurance Fund, a corporation that insures savings bank deposits in excess of federal deposit insurance coverage. The Depositors Insurance Fund is authorized to charge savings banks a risk-based assessment on deposit balances in excess of the amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 Massachusetts has other statutes and regulations that are similar to the federal provisions discussed below.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Federal Bank Regulation 
  Capital Requirements.   Federal regulations require Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8%, and a Tier 1 capital to average assets leverage ratio of 4%.
 For purposes of the regulatory capital requirements, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that made such an election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Provident Bancorp, Inc. has exercised the opt-out and therefore does not include AOCI in its regulatory capital determinations. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased in starting on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. At December 31, 2018, the Bank exceeded the fully phased in regulatory requirement for the capital conservation buffer.
 Legislation enacted in May 2018 requires the federal banking agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to establish for qualifying institutions with assets of less than $10 billion of assets a “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8% to 10% tangible equity/consolidated assets. Institutions with capital levels meeting or exceeding the specified requirement will be considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including all risk-based requirements. The establishment of the community bank leverage ratio is subject to notice and comment rulemaking by the federal regulators. A proposed rule issued by the federal regulators in December 2018 would specify a 9% community bank leverage ratio minimum for institutions to opt into the alternative framework.
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act required each federal banking agency to revise its risk-based capital standards for insured institutions to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest-rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and the risk of nontraditional activities, as well as to reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi-family residential loans. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, along with the other federal banking agencies, adopted a regulation providing that the agencies will take into account the exposure of a bank’s capital and economic value to

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 changes in interest rate risk in assessing a bank’s capital adequacy. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution’s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of the particular circumstances. 
  Standards for Safety and Soundness.   As required by statute, the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit system, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The agencies have also established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. 
  Investment Activities.   All state-chartered Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured banks, including savings banks, are generally limited in their investment activities to principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law, subject to certain exceptions. For example, state chartered banks may, with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market and in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The maximum permissible investment is 100% of Tier 1 Capital, as specified by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s regulations, or the maximum amount permitted by Massachusetts law, whichever is less. 
 In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is authorized to permit such a state bank to engage in state-authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if it meets all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has adopted procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. In addition, a nonmember bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a “financial subsidiary” if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes. 
  Interstate Banking and Branching.   Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, recent amendments made by the Dodd-Frank Act permit banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis to the extent that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state. 
  Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action.   Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically 

 17

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. As of December 31, 2018, The Provident Bank was a “well capitalized” institution under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations. 
 At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. An undercapitalized bank’s compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to an order by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status.
 The previously referenced proposed rulemaking to establish a “community bank leverage ratio” would adjust the referenced categories for qualifying institutions that opt into the alternative framework for regulatory capital requirements. Institutions that exceed the community bank leverage ratio would be considered to have met the capital ratio requirements to be “well capitalized” for the agencies’ prompt corrective rules.
  Transaction with Affiliates and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Regulations.   Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by federal law. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank (although subsidiaries of the bank itself, except financial subsidiaries, are generally not considered affiliates). Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation W limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, and with all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to “covered transactions” as well as to certain other transactions and requires that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from, and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate, and other similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a bank to an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the financial institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
 Sections 22(h) and (g) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to a bank’s insiders, i.e., executive officers, directors and principal shareholders. Under Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10.0% shareholder of a financial institution, and certain affiliated interests of these, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, may not exceed specified limits. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders be made on terms and conditions substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to persons who are not insiders and also 

 18

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a financial institution to insiders cannot exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. 
  Enforcement.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has extensive enforcement authority over insured state savings banks, including The Provident Bank. The enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became “critically undercapitalized.” The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non-member bank under specified circumstances, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (4) insufficient capital; or (5) the incurrence of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance. 
  Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts.   The Provident Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Deposit accounts in The Provident Bank are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations, with less risky institutions paying lower rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) for most banks with less than $10 billion of assets currently range from 11∕2 to 30 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may increase or decrease the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution’s volume of deposits. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was required to seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more were supposed to fund the increase. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation indicated in November 2018 that the 1.35% ratio was exceeded. Insured institutions of less than $10 billion of assets will receive credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to raising the serve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35% effective when the fund ratio achieves 1.38%. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund ratio of 2%. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of The Provident Bank. Future insurance assessment rates cannot be predicted. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule order or regulatory condition imposed in writing. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.
 In addition to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance 

 19

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Corporation, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.32 basis points of total assets less tangible capital. 
  Privacy Regulations.   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations generally require that The Provident Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer’s “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, The Provident Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. The Provident Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations. 
  Community Reinvestment Act.   Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, as implemented by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations, a non-member bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA does require the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in connection with its examination of a non-member bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. The Provident Bank’s latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation CRA rating was “Satisfactory.” 
 Massachusetts has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA which is also applicable to The Provident Bank. The Massachusetts version is generally similar to the CRA but utilizes a five-tiered descriptive rating system. Massachusetts law requires the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks to consider, but not be limited to, a bank’s record of performance under Massachusetts law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. The Provident Bank’s most recent rating under Massachusetts law was “Satisfactory.” 
  Consumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations.   Massachusetts savings banks are subject to a variety of federal and Massachusetts statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees for certain types of violations. 
  USA PATRIOT Act.   The Provident Bank is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gave federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act provided measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents, and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. 
Other Regulations 
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by The Provident Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

 ​
 Federal Reserve System 
 The Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain noninterest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for that portion of transaction accounts aggregating $124.2 million or less (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement is 3.0% and the amounts greater than $124.2 million require a 10.0% reserve (which may be adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board between 8.0% and 14.0%). The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. The Provident Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
Federal Home Loan Bank System 
 The Provident Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. The Provident Bank was in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2018. Based on redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. The Provident Bank reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock. As of December 31, 2018, no impairment has been recognized. 
 At its discretion, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston may declare dividends on the stock. The Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds for certain purposes including the resolution of insolvent thrifts in the late 1980s and to contributing funds for affordable housing programs. These requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the Federal Home Loan Banks pay to their 

 21

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 members and result in the Federal Home Loan Banks imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. In 2018, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston paid dividends equal to an annual yield of 5.66%. There can be no assurance that such dividends will continue in the future. 
Holding Company Regulation 
 Provident Bancorp, Inc. and Provident Bancorp are subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. Provident Bancorp, Inc. and Provident Bancorp are required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be required for Provident Bancorp, Inc. or Provident Bancorp to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. In addition to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, prior approval may also be necessary from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired before any bank acquisition can be completed. 
 A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies. 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including being “well capitalized” and “well managed,” to opt to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. 
 A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding capital distributions, including dividends, by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board’s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has issued guidance that requires consultation with the agency prior to a bank holding company’s payment of dividends of repurchase of stock under certain circumstances. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Provident Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase its stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.

 Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, depository institutions are liable to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for losses suffered or anticipated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to such an institution in danger of default. 
 The status of Provident Bancorp, Inc. and Provident Bancorp as registered bank holding companies under the BHC Act does not exempt them from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws. 
  Massachusetts Holding Company Regulation.   Under the Massachusetts banking laws, a company owning or controlling two or more banking institutions, including a savings bank, is regulated as a bank holding company. The term “company” is defined by the Massachusetts banking laws similarly to the definition of “company” under the BHC Act. Each Massachusetts bank holding company: (i) must obtain the approval of the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation before engaging in certain transactions, such as the acquisition of more than 5% of the voting stock of another banking institution; (ii) must register, and file reports, with the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks; and (iii) is subject to examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. Provident Bancorp, Inc. and Provident Bancorp are not "bank holding companies" under the Massachusetts banking laws.
Change in Control Regulations
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person, or group of persons acting in concert, may acquire control of a bank holding company such as Provident Bancorp, Inc. or Provident Bancorp unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and not disapproved the proposed acquisition. The Federal Reserve Board considers several factors in evaluating a notice, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and competitive effects. Control, as defined under the applicable regulations, means the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of the company or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the company. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting securities constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under certain circumstances, including where, as is the case with Provident Bancorp, Inc., the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control (as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act) of a bank holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Any company that acquires such control becomes a “bank company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board.
 Federal Securities Laws 
 Provident Bancorp, Inc.’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Provident Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 The registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of shares of common stock issued in the stock offering does not cover the resale of those shares. Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not affiliates of Provident Bancorp, Inc. may be resold without registration. Shares purchased by an affiliate of Provident Bancorp, Inc. are subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If Provident Bancorp, Inc. meets the current public information requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, each affiliate of Provident Bancorp, Inc. that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate’s sale to be aggregated with those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of 1% of the outstanding shares of Provident Bancorp, Inc., or the average weekly volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. In the future, Provident Bancorp, Inc. may permit affiliates to have their shares registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently 

 23

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” Provident Bancorp, Inc. qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 
 An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold shareholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation; however, Provident Bancorp, Inc. will also not be subject to additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a “smaller reporting company” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally less than $250 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. Provident Bancorp, Inc. has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a public company. 
 A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.07 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.
 TAXATION 
 Provident Bancorp, Provident Bancorp, Inc. and The Provident Bank are subject to federal and state income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. Provident Bancorp, Inc. and The Provident Bank are not part of Provident Bancorp’s consolidated tax group since Provident Bancorp owns less than 80% of the common stock of Provident Bancorp, Inc. The following discussion of federal and state taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Provident Bancorp, Provident Bancorp, Inc. or The Provident Bank. 
Federal Taxation 
  General. Provident Bancorp reports its income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting. Provident Bancorp, Inc.’s federal income tax returns have been either audited or closed under the statute of limitations through December 31, 2014. For its 2018 tax year, The Provident Bank’s maximum federal income tax rate is 21%. 
  Federal Tax Reform.   On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law H.R. 1, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”). The Act includes a number of changes in existing tax law impacting businesses including, among other things, a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, in December 2017 we were required to re-measure, through income tax expense, our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted rate at which we expect them to be recovered or settled. The re-measurement of our net deferred tax asset resulted in additional income tax expense during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 of $2.0 million.

For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1996, thrift institutions that qualified under certain definitional tests and other conditions of the Internal Revenue Code were permitted to use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve. A reserve could be established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans, generally secured by interests in real property improved or to be improved, under the percentage of taxable income method or the experience method. The reserve for non-qualifying loans was computed using the experience method. Federal legislation enacted in 1996 repealed the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and the percentage of taxable income method for tax years beginning after 1995 and required savings institutions to recapture or take into income certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves. However, those bad debt reserves accumulated prior to 1988 (“Base Year Reserves”) were not required to be recaptured unless the savings institution failed certain tests. The Provident Bank has recaptured all of its Base Year Reserves. 
State Taxation 
 Financial institutions in Massachusetts are required to file combined income tax returns beginning with the year ended December 31, 2009. The Massachusetts excise tax rate for savings banks is currently 9.0% of federal taxable income, adjusted for certain items. Taxable income includes gross income as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, plus interest from bonds, notes and evidences of indebtedness of any state, including Massachusetts, less deductions, but not the credits, allowable under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, except for those deductions relating to dividends received and income or franchise taxes imposed by a state or political subdivision. Carryforwards and carrybacks of net operating losses and capital losses are not allowed. Provident Bancorp’s state tax returns, as well as those of its subsidiaries, are not currently under audit. 
 A financial institution or business corporation is generally entitled to special tax treatment as a “security corporation” under Massachusetts law provided that: (a) its activities are limited to buying, selling, dealing in or holding securities on its own behalf and not as a broker; and (b) it has applied for, and received, classification as a “security corporation” by the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. A security corporation that is also a bank holding company under the Internal Revenue Code must pay a tax equal to 0.33% of its gross income. A security corporation that is not a bank holding company under the Internal Revenue Code must pay a tax equal to 1.32% of its gross income. The Provident Bank’s subsidiaries, Provident Security Corporation and 5 Market Street Security Corporation, which engage in securities transactions on their own behalf, are qualified as security corporations. As such, it has received security corporation classification by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue; and does not conduct any activities deemed impermissible under the governing statutes and the various regulations, directives, letter rulings and administrative pronouncements issued by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. 
 The New Hampshire Business Profits tax is assessed at the rate of 8.5%. For this purpose, gross business profits generally mean federal taxable income subject to certain modifications provided for in New Hampshire law. The New Hampshire Business Enterprise tax is assessed at 0.75% of the total amount of payroll and certain employee benefits expense, interest expense, and dividends paid to shareholders. The New Hampshire Business Enterprise tax is applied as a credit towards the New Hampshire Business Profits tax.
