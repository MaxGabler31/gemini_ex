Syndicore Asia Limited  Video Syndication and E-Commerce Company
 
Syndicore Asia Limited (SAL) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company formed under the laws of Hong Kong. SAL is an online media company that syndicates video in a cloud-based, multimedia conduit serving a growing, global community of content creators, news outlets and leading brands. SAL will be a provider of syndicated video media to news organizations in the Asia Pacific region. In addition, SAL plans to aggregate content from the Asia Pacific region and provide it to news organizations around the world.
 On December 15, 2013, SAL entered into a Distribution Agreement (the Distribution Agreement) with SendtoNews Video, Inc., a British Columbia company (STN). Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, SAL was granted an exclusive license to use, modify, edit, reproduce, distribute, feed, store, communicate, display, and transmit STNs content in the Asia Pacific Territory (the Content). STN is the content provider for various worldwide sporting events. STN would also provide on-going assistance to SAL with regard to technical, administrative, and service-orientated issues relating to the delivery, utilization, transmission, storage and maintenance of the Content.
 On January 20, 2014, SAL entered into a revised Distribution Agreement whereby STN has agreed to provide SAL transferrable rights for the use, reproduction, storage, display, and transmission of certain content subject to pre-approval in writing from STN. In addition, the revised Distribution Agreement includes changes to the revenue sharing terms, and adds a share of advertising revenue directly resulting from aggregated content by SAL within the territory.
 SAL will strive to become a leading digital content provider for the Asia Pacific region, capitalizing on an explosively growing market with local, regional and national content that was previously unavailable in the area. This is a new and exciting market, and offers exciting opportunities for expansion and growth. There is no assurance, however, that SAL will be successful in its efforts.
 On the other side of the distribution chain, we plan to create SALs own proprietary news partnerships to provide guaranteed content distribution in return for a corresponding share of advertising revenues to a news industry looking to supplement their rapidly declining traditional ad revenue with viable digital-age revenue. 
  Digital ad spending is on the rise. It is forecasted to expand from $117.60 billion USD in 2013 to $173.12 billion USD in 2017. (Go-Globe.com)
  The increase in worldwide digital ad spending is led by the Asia-Pacific region and specifically China. 
  China is estimated to reach 33% of the worlds total ad spending by 2017. (Infographic) 
  Branded video content reaches nearly half (46%) of all internet users. More than half of these people (54%) go on to click though to the brands website (Econsultancy)
  80% of internet users recall watching a video ad on a website they visited in the past 30 days; 46% took some action after viewing the ad (Online Publishers Association)
  Video promotion is over 6 times more effective than print and online (b2bmarketing.net)
  Dr. James McQuivey of Forrester Research says a minute of video is worth 1.8 million words
  90% of information transmitted to the brain is visual, and visuals are processed 60,000X faster in the brain than text (3M Corporation & Zabisco)
 Management believes that SALs customers will be willing to pay a premium CPM because:
  The ability to sponsor exclusive, highly sought-after short form video content
  Deep, creative advertising opportunities  other than rudimentary logo/banner overlays and pre-roll
  Premium positioning
  Unprecedented transparency and near real-time performance metrics to evaluate their investment
  Securing sponsorships with related enterprises
  Stronger control over distribution to help target intended audience.
  Other segments of the market are also benefiting. The high and rapidly increasing popularity of social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are expected to revolutionize the marketing strategies employed in areas such as the pharmaceuticals industry. There, in addition to marketing, an increasing number of pharma players have also begun leveraging these platforms to enhance consumer relationships and improve brand management, based on the market intelligence generated by monitoring and analyzing user-generated content. The ability to incorporate consumer feedback to develop new products is also expected to initiate a strategic shift in the operational model of pharma companies. Social media involvements are expected to increase product sales, especially those of OTC drugs, in the long term. Novartis for instance has already begun using YouTube and Facebook to enhance the sales for its OTC drugs such as Comtrex, Orofar and Bufferin. Johnson &Johnson, one of the first pharma giants to enter the social media space, has used online platforms for crisis management  when the company recalled its products (Tylenol and Benadryl tablets) it used social websites to apologize to consumers for irregularities in its manufacturing plant found during FDA inspection.

 According to eMarketer:
 Ecommerce sales in China are expected to pass $1.132 trillion in 2017, accounting for nearly half of the worldwide retail ecommerce sales.
 Chinas ecommerce sales will account for 23.1% of all retail sales in China in 2017, however, this figure is expected to increase to 40.8% by 2021.
 The popularity of shopping on a mobile phone is expected to continue with eMarketer predicting more than 75% of ecommerce sales  over $1tn - will be transacted via a mobile device.
 China is the worlds largest ecommerce market with a significant lead on other markets including the US ($450.81bn), UK ($110.07bn) and Japan ($95.33bn).
 And according to Zeniths Mobile Advertising Forecasts 2017: The country with the highest number of smartphone users will be China, with 1.3 billion users, followed by India, with 530 million users. The US will be third, with 229 million users. Chinese consumers moved more of their shopping online in 2017, sending e-retail sales past $1 trillion for the first time in the worlds leading e-commerce market.
 With the highest number of smart phone users in the world, increasing penetration amongst the population and a growing trend towards smart apps, platforms and online shopping, the China market should allow HSAL multiple avenues of expansion within its existing business model. Traditional models of E-Commerce are encompassing a larger amount of the Internet of Things and data analytics with smart technology and applications.
