ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on September 10, 2013, as Betafox Corp., for the purpose of engaging in the business of manufacturing and selling candles. On May 11 2015, our principal stockholder at that time sold six million shares of our common stock, constituting approximately 73.8% of our issued and outstanding common shares at such time, to Future Continental Limited. In October 2015, Future Continental Limited sold those shares to Mr. Lei Pei, an affiliate of Future Continental Limited, in consideration of Mr. Pei’s agreement to serve as our director and CEO. On January 8, 2018, we changed our name to Wewards, Inc. Our corporate office is located in Las Vegas, Nevada.
 
We have developed and are the owner of a web-based platform accessible by mobile apps (the “Platform”) that will enable consumers to purchase goods from merchants and earn rebates payable in the form of Bitcoin. The Platform provides an innovative Bitcoin rewards ecosystem. It is designed to transform traditional concepts of commerce into a cooperative society where both merchants and consumers are collaborating, utilizing Bitcoin to reward consumers. The ecosystem provides consumers with rewards each time they complete a challenge defined by a merchant. This is intended to make the ecommerce process beneficial to all market participants, and to help distribute commercial wealth among and between the merchants and consumers. 
 
We intend to generate revenue by licensing “white-label” versions of the Platform to third parties. However, to date, no such license agreement has been entered into, and we have not generated any revenues from the Platform.
 
On April 2, 2020, we purchased intellectual property rights (“IP”) from United Power, a Nevada corporation under common ownership with Lei Pei, our sole officer and director and majority shareholder, for cash consideration of $179,300, based on a price determined by an independent valuation.
 
The IP consists of technology and related rights associated with the game Megopoly, an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online Game). Megopoly is an MMO board game where players are able to earn fractions of Bitcoins (satoshi) through buying, selling, and managing virtual real estate properties using in-game currency (Megopoly Coins). The game is similar in some respects to Monopoly.
 
The game allows players around the world to interact with each other online. Players travel (move) through different parts of a city, earning profit by investing in properties, charging rent, acquiring bonus assets, and selling their properties to other players for in-game currency. A player is able to progress to higher levels of “cities” at any time.
 
The player’s goal in Megopoly is to earn Megopoly Coins by investing in properties and collecting rent from other players. Players can keep playing the game using their Megopoly Coins for the opportunity to earn more coins, or they can exchange those coins for Bitcoins based on real-time market exchange rates.

Megopoly is playable at any time through a web browser on a PC, tablet or smart phone, in both Chinese and English. The game has been designed for players of all skill levels. To date, we have not generated any revenue from Megopoly other than pursuant to related party agreements as described below.
 
We did not generate any revenue during our fiscal year ended May 31, 2022. During our fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, we generated revenue from licensing Megopoly and related IP to Sandbx Corp., a separate company owned by the Chief Operating Officer of United Power and FL Galaxy, related parties of the Company, as our Chief Executive Officer, Lei Pei, is also the Chief Executive Officer of United Power and FL Galaxy. Pursuant to our license agreement with Sandbx Corp., we received a $50,000 initial setup fee, and a monthly royalty payment in the amount of 10% of net revenues from the sale of in-game assets by the licensee, or $5,000, whichever was greater, resulting in total revenues of $83,454 under this license agreement during the year ended May 31, 2021. The license agreement was terminated on May 16, 2021. The Company also entered into an agreement in January of 2021 with Sandbx Corp. to further develop the Megopoly game, under which the Company paid Sandbx Corp. monthly fees of $168,500, resulting in $1,622,500 and $842,500 of related party software development costs for the years ended May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The development agreement with Sandbx Corp. was terminated with the completion of Megopoly in December of 2021. The Company is now actively seeking licensing arrangements to bring the game to market.
 
Employees
 
We currently have no full-time employees, other than our sole officer and director Mr. Lei Pei, who receives no salary.
 
Research and Development Expenditures
 
We intend to continue to make investments in research and development and product development in seeking to sustain and improve our competitive position and meet our customers’ needs.
Government Regulation
 
Because of the current regulatory uncertainties surrounding the Platform, we do not intend to operate the Platform in the United States unless and until we are satisfied that our operations will not be in violation of any statutes or regulations. At this time, we are unable to determine what governmental agencies, if any, will have jurisdiction over the Platform, or what effect, if any, those government regulations will have on the Platform. 
Currently, all of our operations consist of outsourced licensing arrangements.
 
Patents and Trademarks
 
We do not own any patents or trademarks.
