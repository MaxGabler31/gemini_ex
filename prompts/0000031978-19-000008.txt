Palo Verde
The Company owns an interest, along with six other utilities, in the three nuclear generating units and common facilities ("Common Facilities") at Palo Verde. Arizona Public Service Company ("APS") serves as operating agent for Palo Verde, and under the Arizona Nuclear Power Project Participation Agreement dated August 23, 1973, as amended ("ANPP Participation Agreement"), the Company has limited ability to influence operations and costs at Palo Verde.

• | Palo Verde Operating Licenses. Operation of each of the three Palo Verde Units requires an operating license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC"). The NRC issued full power operating licenses for Unit 1 in June 1985, Unit 2 in April 1986 and Unit 3 in November 1987 and issued renewed operating licenses for each of the three units in April 2011, which extended the licenses for Units 1, 2 and 3 to June 2045, April 2046 and November 2047, respectively.


• | Decommissioning. Pursuant to the ANPP Participation Agreement and federal law, the Company must fund its share of the estimated costs to decommission Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3, including the Common Facilities, through the term of their respective operating licenses. In 2017, the Palo Verde Participants approved the 2016 Palo Verde decommissioning study ("2016 Study"), which estimated that the Company must fund approximately $432.8 million (stated in 2016 dollars) to cover its share of decommissioning costs. At December 31, 2018, the Company's decommissioning trust fund had a balance of $276.9 million. Although the 2016 Study was based on the latest available information, there can be no assurance that decommissioning cost estimates will not increase in the future or that regulatory requirements will not change.


• | Spent Fuel and Waste Disposal. Pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987, the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is legally obligated to accept and dispose of all spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste generated by all domestic power reactors by 1998. The DOE's obligations are reflected in a contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste ("Standard Contract") with each nuclear power plant. The DOE failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998. On December 19, 2012, APS, acting on behalf of itself and the Palo Verde Participants, filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the DOE. This lawsuit sought to recover damages incurred due to the DOE’s failure to accept Palo Verde’s spent nuclear fuel for the period beginning January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2011. Pursuant to the terms of the August 18, 2014 settlement agreement, and as amended with the DOE, APS files annual claims for the period July 1 of the then-previous year to June 30 of the then-current year on behalf of itself and those utilities that share in power and energy entitlements, and bear certain allocated costs, with respect to Palo Verde based upon the ANPP Participation Agreement dated August 23, 1973. The settlement agreement, as amended, provides APS with a method for submitting claims and receiving recovery for costs incurred through December 31, 2016, which has been extended to December 31, 2019. The Company's share of costs recovered in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively are presented below (in thousands):


Costs Recovery Period | Amount Refunded | | Amount Credited to Customers through Fuel Adjustment Clauses | | Period Credited to Customers
July 2016 - June 2017 | $ | 1,413 | | | $ | 1,121 | | March 2018
July 2015 - June 2016 | 1,779 | | | 1,432 | | | March 2017
July 2014 - June 2015 | 1,884 | | | 1,581 | | | March 2016

On October 31, 2018, APS filed a $10.2 million claim for the period July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018. The Company's share of this claim is approximately $1.6 million. This claim is pending DOE review. The majority of the reimbursement received by the Company is expected to be credited to customers through the applicable fuel adjustment clauses.

• | DOE’s Construction Authorization Application for Yucca Mountain. The DOE had planned to meet its disposal obligations by designing, licensing, constructing and operating a permanent geologic repository in Yucca Mountain, Nevada. In March 2010, the DOE filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice its Yucca Mountain construction authorization application that was pending before the NRC. Several interested parties have intervened in the NRC proceeding. Additionally, a number of interested parties have filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the DOE's authority to withdraw the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application and NRC’s cessation of its review of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. The cases have been consolidated into one matter at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the

 2

District of Columbia Circuit ("D.C. Circuit"). In August 2013, the D.C. Circuit ordered the NRC to resume its review of the application with available appropriated funds.
On October 16, 2014, the NRC issued Volume 3 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. This volume addresses repository safety after permanent closure, and the issuance of Volume 3 is a key milestone in the Yucca Mountain licensing process. Volume 3 contains the NRC staff’s finding that the DOE’s repository design meets the requirements that apply after the repository is permanently closed, including but not limited to the post-closure performance objectives in the NRC’s regulations. 
On December 18, 2014, the NRC issued Volume 4 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. This volume covers administrative and programmatic requirements for the repository. It documents the NRC staff’s evaluation of whether the DOE’s research and development and performance confirmation programs, as well as other administrative controls and systems, meet applicable NRC requirements. Volume 4 contains the NRC staff’s finding that most administrative and programmatic requirements in NRC regulations are met, except for certain requirements relating to ownership of land and water rights.
Publication of Volumes 3 and 4 does not signal whether or when the NRC might authorize construction of the repository. The Company cannot predict when spent fuel shipments to the DOE will commence.

• | Waste Confidence and Continued Storage. On June 8, 2012, the D.C. Circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the NRC’s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and permanent disposal of high level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel. The petitioners challenged the NRC’s 2010 update to the agency’s Waste Confidence Decision and temporary storage rule ("Waste Confidence Decision").

The D.C. Circuit found that the agency’s 2010 Waste Confidence Decision update constituted a major federal action, which, consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"), requires either an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact from the agency’s actions. The D.C. Circuit found that the NRC’s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient, and therefore remanded the 2010 Waste Confidence Decision update for further action consistent with NEPA. 
On September 6, 2012, the NRC Commissioners issued a directive to the NRC staff to proceed directly with development of a generic environmental impact statement to support an updated Waste Confidence Decision. The NRC Commissioners also directed the NRC staff to establish a schedule to publish a final rule and environmental impact study within 24 months of September 6, 2012.
In September 2013, the NRC issued its draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement ("GEIS") to support an updated Waste Confidence Decision. On August 26, 2014, the NRC approved a final rule on the environmental effects of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel. Renamed the Continued Storage Rule, the NRC's decision adopted the findings of the GEIS regarding the environmental impacts of storing spent fuel at any reactor site after the reactor’s licensed period of operations. As a result, those generic impacts do not need to be re-analyzed in the environmental reviews for individual licenses. Although Palo Verde has not been involved in any licensing actions affected by the D.C. Circuit’s June 8, 2012 decision, the NRC lifted its suspension on final licensing actions on all nuclear power plant licenses and renewals that went into effect when the D.C. Circuit issued its June 2012 decision. The final Continued Storage Rule was subject to continuing legal challenges before the NRC and the Court of Appeals. In June 2016, the D.C. Circuit issued its final decision, rejecting all remaining legal challenges to the Continue Storage Rule. On August 8, 2016, the D.C. Circuit denied a petition for rehearing. 
Palo Verde has sufficient capacity at its on-site independent spent fuel storage installation ("ISFSI") to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period, which ends in December 2027. Additionally, Palo Verde has sufficient capacity at its on-site ISFSI to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation, which ends in November 2047. If uncertainties regarding the U.S. government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved, APS will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the ISFSI to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation. 

• | The One-Mill Fee. In 2011, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and the Nuclear Energy Institute challenged the DOE’s 2010 determination of the adequacy of the one tenth of a cent per kilowatt-hour ("kWh") fee ("one-mill fee") paid by the nation’s commercial nuclear power plant owners pursuant to their individual obligations under the Standard Contract. This fee was recovered by the Company through applicable

 3

fuel adjustment clauses. In June 2012, the D.C. Circuit held that the DOE failed to conduct a sufficient fee analysis in making the 2010 determination. The D.C. Circuit remanded the 2010 determination to the Secretary of the DOE with instructions to conduct a new fee adequacy determination within six months. In February 2013, upon completion of the DOE’s revised one-mill fee adequacy determination, the court reopened the proceedings. On November 19, 2013, the D.C. Circuit ordered the Secretary of the DOE to notify Congress of his intent to suspend collecting annual fees for nuclear waste disposal from nuclear power plant operators, as he is required to do pursuant to the NWPA and the court’s order. On January 3, 2014, the Secretary of the DOE notified Congress of his intention to suspend collection of the one-mill fee, subject to Congress’ disapproval and on May 16, 2014, the DOE notified all commercial nuclear power plant operators, effective May 16, 2014, the one-mill fee was suspended. Electricity generated at Palo Verde and sold on or after May 16, 2014 is no longer subjected to the one-mill fee.

• | NRC Oversight of the Nuclear Energy Industry in the Wake of the Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan. The NRC regulates the operation of all commercial nuclear power reactors in the U.S., including Palo Verde. The NRC periodically conducts inspections of nuclear facilities and monitors performance indicators to enable the agency to arrive at objective conclusions about a licensee's safety performance. Following the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the NRC established a task force to conduct a systematic and methodical review of NRC processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should make additional improvements to its regulatory system. On March 12, 2012, the NRC issued the first regulatory requirements based on the recommendations of the NRC's Near Term Task Force. With respect to Palo Verde, the NRC issued two orders requiring safety enhancements regarding: (1) mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at plants and (2) enhancement of spent fuel pool instrumentation.

The NRC has issued a series of interim staff guidance documents regarding implementation of these requirements. Palo Verde has met the NRC's imposed deadlines for the installation of equipment to address these requirements. Palo Verde has spent approximately $125.4 million (the Company's share is $19.8 million) on capital enhancements related to these requirements as of December 31, 2018.

• | Liability and Insurance Matters. The Palo Verde Participants have insurance for public liability resulting from nuclear energy hazards, covered by primary liability insurance provided by commercial insurance carriers and an industry-wide retrospective assessment program. If a loss at a nuclear power plant covered by the programs exceeds the accumulated funds in the primary level of protection, the Company could be assessed retrospective premium adjustments on a per incident basis up to $62.1 million, with an annual payment limitation of approximately $9.7 million. The Palo Verde Participants also maintain $2.8 billion of "all risk" nuclear property insurance. The insurance provides coverage for property damage and decontamination at Palo Verde. For covered incidents involving property damage not accompanied by a release of radioactive material, the policy's coverage limit is $2.3 billion. In addition, the Company has secured insurance against portions of any increased cost of generation or purchased power and business interruption resulting from a sudden and unforeseen outage at Palo Verde.

Fossil-Fueled Plants
The Company owns the Newman Power Station ("Newman"), which consists of three conventional steam-electric generating units and two combined cycle generating units. The station operates primarily on natural gas but the conventional steam-electric generating units can also operate on fuel oil.
The Company owns the Rio Grande Power Station ("Rio Grande"), which consists of two conventional steam-electric generating units and one aeroderivative unit that operates on natural gas. Rio Grande Unit 6 with net capacity of 42.5 MW, was initially placed in inactive reserve status in 2015, and has been activated as needed. 
The Company owns the Montana Power Station ("MPS"), which consists of four aeroderivative generating units that operate on natural gas. The units can also operate on fuel oil.
The Company owns the Copper Power Station ("Copper"), which consists of a natural gas combustion turbine used primarily to meet peak demand.
Prior to July 6, 2016, the Company owned a 7% interest in Units 4 and 5 at Four Corners Generating Station ("Four Corners"). The Company shared power entitlements and certain allocated costs of the two units with APS (the Four Corners operating agent) and the other Four Corners participants. On July 6, 2016, the Company sold its interests in Four Corners for $32.0 million to 4C Acquisition, LLC, an affiliate of APS ("APS's affiliate"), and Pinnacle West Capital Corporation ("Pinnacle West"), the parent company of APS and APS's affiliate. No significant gain or loss was recorded for this sale. APS's affiliate assumed responsibility 
 4

for all Four Corners capital expenditures made after July 6, 2016, which assumption is guaranteed by Pinnacle West. In addition, APS's affiliate will indemnify the Company against certain liabilities and costs related to the future operation of Four Corners, which indemnification is guaranteed by Pinnacle West. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note D and Note F of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussions. 
Solar Photovoltaic Facilities
The Company’s Texas Community solar facility, a 3 MW utility-scale solar plant located at MPS, and the El Paso Electric Holloman Atlas Solar Array, a 5 MW utility-scale solar plant located on HAFB, began commercial operations on May 31, 2017, and October 18, 2018, respectively. The Company also owns six other solar photovoltaic facilities with a total capacity of 0.2 MW.
Transmission and Distribution Lines and Agreements
The Company owns, or has significant ownership interests in, four 345 kilovolt ("kV") transmission lines in New Mexico and Arizona and three 500 kV lines in Arizona. These lines enable the Company to deliver its energy entitlements from its remote generation at Palo Verde to its service area (pursuant to various transmission and power exchange agreements to which the Company is a party). The Company also owns the transmission and distribution network within its New Mexico and Texas retail service area and operates these facilities under franchise agreements with various municipalities. Pursuant to standards established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, the Company operates its transmission system in a way that allows it to maintain system integrity in the event that any one of these transmission lines is out of service.
In addition to the transmission and distribution lines within our service territory, the Company's transmission network and associated substations include the following:

Line | Length (miles) | Voltage (kV) | | Company Ownership Interest
Springerville-Macho Springs-Luna-Diablo Line (1) | 310 | | 345 | | 100.0 | %
West Mesa-Arroyo Line (2) | 202 | | 345 | | 100.0 | %
Greenlee-Hidalgo-Luna-Newman Line (3) | | | | 
Greenlee-Hidalgo | 60 | | 345 | | 40.0 | %
Hidalgo-Luna | 50 | | 345 | | 57.2 | %

Environmental Matters
General. The Company is subject to extensive laws, regulations and permit requirements with respect to air and GHG emissions, water discharges, soil and water quality, waste management and disposal, natural resources and other environmental matters by federal, state, regional, tribal and local authorities. Failure to comply with such laws, regulations and requirements can result in actions by authorities or other third parties that might seek to impose on the Company administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties or other sanctions. In addition, releases of pollutants or contaminants into the environment can result in costly cleanup liabilities. These laws, regulations and requirements are subject to change through modification or reinterpretation, or the introduction of new laws and regulations, and, as a result, the Company may face additional capital and operating costs to comply. Certain key environmental issues, laws and regulations facing the Company are described further below.
In March 2017, the Company entered into a Compliance Agreement ("Compliance Agreement") with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality under the Texas Environmental, Health and Safety Audit Privilege Act to address certain water and waste compliance issues associated with the integrity of the synthetic liner of the evaporation pond at Newman. The Company has initiated a capital project to extend the life of evaporation pond and in doing so will complete its obligation of the Compliance Agreement. The Compliance Agreement remains in effect.
Air Emissions. The U.S. Clean Air Act ("CAA"), associated regulations and comparable state and local laws and regulations relating to air emissions impose, among other obligations, limitations on pollutants generated during the operations of the Company's facilities and assets, including sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxides.
National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS"). Under the CAA, the U.S Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") sets NAAQS for six criteria pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment, including particulate matter, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, ozone and sulfur dioxide. On October 1, 2015, the EPA released a final rule tightening the primary and secondary NAAQS for ground-level ozone from its 2008 standard levels of 75 parts per billion ("ppb") to 70 ppb. The EPA published the Final Rule on June 4, 2018, designating El Paso County, Texas, as "attainment/unclassifiable" under the 2015 ozone NAAQS and designating a section of southern Doña Ana County, New Mexico, as "nonattainment." In August, several petitions for review of the Final Rule were filed in the D.C. Circuit. One of these petitions, filed by the City of Sunland Park, New Mexico, specifically challenges the "attainment/unclassifiable" designation of El Paso County, Texas. The Company and other intervenors filed and were granted motions to intervene in the challenges to EPA's 2015 ozone NAAQS designations. A briefing schedule extending through July 2019 has been established for the case.
States, including New Mexico, that contain any areas designated as nonattainment are required to complete development of implementation plans in the 2020-2021 timeframe. Most nonattainment areas are expected to have until 2020 or 2023 to meet the primary (health) standard, with the exact attainment date varying based on the ozone level in the area. The Company continues to evaluate what impact these final and proposed NAAQS could have on its operations. If the Company is required to install additional equipment to control emissions at its facilities, the NAAQS, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on its operations and financial results.
Other Laws and Regulations and Risks. The Company sold its interest in Four Corners to APS's affiliate on July 6, 2016 at the expiration of the 50-year participation agreement. As of the closing date of the sale, the Company’s environmental liabilities associated with Four Corners were limited to conditions that existed at the time of the sale and further limited to the portion thereof for which the Company would have been financially responsible if Four Corners had fully ceased operation on July 6, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement ("Purchase and Sale Agreement"), neither APS's affiliate nor APS assumed the Company's pre-closing obligations under environmental laws with respect to its interest in Four Corners. The Company may be subject to certain future claims under environmental laws and regulations as a former owner of Four Corners. The extent of such claims, if any, cannot be predicted with certainty. 
Climate Change. There has been a wide-ranging policy debate, at the local, state, national and international levels, regarding the impact of GHG and possible means for their regulation. Efforts continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. In April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and "represent a progression" in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. In August 2017, the United States formally documented to the United Nations its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The earliest possible effective withdrawal date from the Paris Agreement is November 2020. At the state level, several states have already adopted measures requiring GHG emissions to be reduced within state boundaries. For example, the governor of New Mexico signed an executive order in January 2019 that supports the Paris Agreement and includes a goal of reducing statewide GHG emissions by at least 45% by 2030. The executive order also creates a Climate Change Task Force to evaluate and develop regulatory strategies to reach the 45% reduction goal. Although the Company cannot currently determine the effect of potential regulatory strategies that may be 
 6

suggested by the New Mexico Climate Change Task Force, if implemented, they could be material to the Company's business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. 
The federal government has considered, proposed and/or finalized legislation or regulations limiting GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide. In particular, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to restrict or regulate GHG emissions. In October 2015, the EPA published a rule establishing guidelines for states to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants, known as the Clean Power Plan ("CPP"). Legal challenges to the CPP are ongoing. On August 31, 2018, the EPA published a proposal to replace the CPP called the Affordable Clean Energy ("ACE") rule. The ACE rule has not yet been finalized. At this time the Company cannot determine the impact that the CPP, the ACE rule, and related proposals and legal challenges may have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
A significant portion of the Company's generation assets are nuclear or gas-fired, and as a result, the Company believes that its GHG emissions are low relative to electric power companies who rely more on coal-fired generation. Current and future legislation and regulation of GHG or any future related litigation could impose significant costs and/or operating restrictions on the Company, reduce demand for the power the Company generates, and/or require the Company to purchase rights to emit GHG, any of which could be material to the Company's business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
Climate change also has potential physical effects that could be relevant to the Company's business. Climate change could affect the Company's service area by causing higher temperatures, less winter precipitation and less spring runoff, as well as by causing more extreme weather events. Such developments could change the demand for power in the region and could also impact the price or ready availability of water supplies or affect maintenance needs and the reliability of Company equipment. The Company believes that material effects on the Company's business or results of operations may result from the physical consequences of climate change, the regulatory approach to climate change ultimately selected and implemented by governmental authorities, or both. Given the significant uncertainties regarding whether and how these issues will be regulated, as well as the timing and severity of any physical effects of climate change, the Company believes it is not possible to meaningfully quantify the costs of these potential impacts at present.
Environmental Litigation and Investigations. Since July 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, and APS have been engaged in substantive settlement negotiations in an effort to resolve certain pending matters. The allegations being addressed through settlement negotiations are that APS failed to obtain the necessary permits and install the controls necessary under the CAA to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, and that APS failed to obtain an operating permit under Title V of the CAA that reflects applicable requirements imposed by law. On June 24, 2015, the parties filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico a settlement agreement ("CAA Settlement Agreement") resolving this matter. On August 17, 2015, the U.S. District Court entered the CAA Settlement Agreement. The agreement imposes a total civil penalty payable by the co-owners of Four Corners collectively in the amount of $1.5 million, and it requires the co-owners to pay $6.7 million for environmental mitigation projects. At December 31, 2018, the Company has accrued its remaining unpaid share of approximately $0.2 million related to this matter.

Construction Program 
Utility construction expenditures reflected in the following table consist primarily of local generation, expanding and updating the transmission and distribution systems, the cost of capital improvements and replacements at Palo Verde and other generating facilities, and other property and equipment. Studies indicate that the Company will need additional power generation resources to meet increasing load requirements on its system and to replace retiring plants. After evaluation of the competitive 2017 All Source Request for Proposals for Electric Power Supply and Load Management Resources (“2017 All Source RFP”), the winning bids include the construction of a 226 MW natural gas combustion turbine generating unit at Newman in El Paso with an anticipated operational date in 2023. The costs of the new generating unit are included in the table below. The winning bids also included purchased power agreements for 200 MW of utility scale solar resources and 100 MW of battery storage, which are not included in the construction program. The selected proposals are subject to the execution of contracts following negotiations with the winning bidders, obtaining the applicable environmental and construction related permits, and obtaining necessary approvals by the Public Utility Commission of Texas ("PUCT") and the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission ("NMPRC").
The Company’s estimated cash construction costs for 2019 through 2023 are approximately $1.3 billion. Actual costs may vary from the construction program estimates shown. Such estimates are under continuous review and subject to ongoing adjustment and are updated periodically to reflect changed conditions.

Allocated fuel and purchased power costs are generally recoverable from customers in Texas and New Mexico pursuant to applicable regulations. Historical fuel costs and revenues are reconciled periodically in proceedings before the PUCT and the NMPRC. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note D of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion on Texas and New Mexico Regulatory Matters.
Nuclear Fuel
The nuclear fuel cycle for Palo Verde consists of the following stages:  the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates, the conversion of the uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride ("conversion services"), the enrichment of uranium hexafluoride ("enrichment services"), the fabrication of fuel assemblies ("fabrication services"), the utilization of the fuel assemblies in the reactors, and the storage and disposal of the spent fuel.  
Pursuant to the ANPP Participation Agreement, the Company owns an undivided interest in nuclear fuel purchased in connection with Palo Verde. The Palo Verde Participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs. The Palo Verde Participants have contracted for 100% of Palo Verde's requirements for uranium concentrates through 2025 and 15% of its requirements through 2028. The participants have contracted for 100% of Palo Verde's requirement for conversion services through 2025 and 40% of its requirements through 2028. The participants have also contracted for 100% of Palo Verde's requirement for enrichment services through 2021 and 90% of its requirement for 2022, and 80% for 2023 through 2026 and all of Palo Verde's requirement for fuel assembly fabrication services through 2027.
Nuclear Fuel Financing. The Company’s financing of nuclear fuel is accomplished through Rio Grande Resources Trust II ("RGRT"), a Texas grantor trust, which is consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. As of December 31, 2018, RGRT has $110 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2020 and 2025. On June 28, 2018, RGRT completed the sale of $65 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due August 15, 2025. The Company guarantees the payment of principal and interest on the RGRT senior notes. The proceeds from the sale of the RGRT senior notes were used by RGRT to repay amounts borrowed under the then-existing revolving credit facility and enable future nuclear fuel financing requirements of RGRT to be met with a combination of the senior notes and amounts borrowed under the Company's Revolving Credit Facility ("RCF"). 
Natural Gas
The Company manages its natural gas requirements through a combination of a long-term (greater than a year) supply contract, several medium-term (greater than a month but less than one year) supply contracts and spot or short-term (daily to a month) market purchases. The long-term supply contract provides for firm deliveries of gas at market-based index prices. Medium-term and spot agreements are either fixed priced and/or index priced depending on the market. Through March 2018, the Company’s natural gas requirements at Newman, Rio Grande and MPS were met with short-term, medium-term and long-term natural gas purchases from various suppliers; thereafter, there were only short-term and medium term natural gas purchases, and this practice is expected to continue in 2019. Interstate gas is delivered under a base firm transportation contract. The Company has expanded its firm interstate transportation contract to include MPS. The Company anticipates it will continue to purchase natural gas at spot market prices on a monthly basis for a portion of the fuel needs for Newman, Rio Grande and MPS. The Company will continue to evaluate the availability of short-term natural gas supplies versus medium and long-term supplies to maintain a reliable and economical supply for its local generating stations.
 9

Natural gas for Newman and Copper was also delivered pursuant to a long-term intrastate natural gas contract for firm transportation that became effective October 1, 2009 and continued through March 31, 2018. Beginning April 1, 2018, intrastate natural gas reservation and storage for Newman and Copper has been provided through new contracts with ONEOK WesTex Transmission, LLC and ONEOK Texas Gas Storage, LLC, respectively, that continue through March 31, 2028. It is anticipated that deliveries of intrastate natural gas to MPS may begin in the first quarter of 2019. Under this new contract, intrastate gas supply will be sourced in the same manner as interstate gas through a variety of medium and short-term purchase contracts.
Purchased Power
To supplement its own generation and operating reserve requirements, and to meet its Renewable Portfolio Standard ("RPS") requirements, the Company engages in power purchase arrangements that may vary in duration and amount based on an evaluation of the Company’s resource needs, the economics of the transactions and specific RPS requirements.
The Company has a firm 100 MW Power Purchase and Sale Agreement ("Power Purchase and Sale Agreement") with Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Energy Services LLC ("Freeport"), pursuant to which Freeport will deliver energy to the Company from the Luna Energy Facility (a natural gas-fired combined cycle generation facility located in Luna County, New Mexico) and the Company will deliver a like amount of energy at Greenlee, Arizona. The Company may purchase up to the contracted MW amount at a specified price at times when energy is not exchanged under the Power Purchase and Sale Agreement. The Power Purchase and Sale Agreement was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") and will continue through an initial term ending December 31, 2021, with subsequent rollovers until terminated. Upon mutual agreement, the Power Purchase and Sale Agreement allows the parties to increase the amount of energy that is purchased and sold thereunder. The parties have agreed to increase the amount up to 125 MW through December 2021.
The Company has entered into several power purchase agreements to help meet its RPS requirements. Specifically, the Company has a 25-year power purchase agreement with Hatch Solar Energy Center I, LLC for a 5 MW solar photovoltaic project located in southern New Mexico, which began commercial operation in July 2011. In June 2015, the Company entered into a consent agreement with Hatch Solar Energy Center I, LLC to provide for additional or replacement photovoltaic modules. The Company also entered into a 20-year contract with Solar Roadrunner, LLC, a subsidiary of Global Infrastructure Partners, (formerly known as NRG Solar Roadrunner LLC) for the purchase of all of the output of a 20 MW solar photovoltaic plant built in southern New Mexico, which began commercial operation in August 2011. In addition, the Company has 25-year power purchase agreements to purchase all of the output of two additional solar photovoltaic projects located in southern New Mexico, SunE EPE1, LLC (10 MW) and SunE EPE2, LLC (12 MW), which began commercial operation in June 2012 and May 2012, respectively. In September 2017, Longroad Solar Portfolio Holdings, LLC purchased SunE EPE1, LLC, and in October 2017, Silicon Ranch Corporation purchased SunE EPE2, LLC with the Company's consent per the terms of both power purchase agreements.
Furthermore, the Company has a 20-year power purchase agreement with Macho Springs Solar, LLC to purchase the entire generation output delivered from the 50 MW Macho Springs solar photovoltaic project located in Luna County, New Mexico which began commercial operation in May 2014. Finally, the Company has a 30-year power purchase agreement with Newman Solar LLC to purchase the total output, which is approximately 10 MW, from a solar photovoltaic generation plant on land subleased from the Company in proximity to Newman. This solar project began commercial operation in December 2014.
Other purchases of shorter duration were made during 2018 to supplement the Company's generation resources during planned and unplanned outages, for economic reasons and to supply off-system sales.
The Company recently concluded and announced its selection of resources from its 2017 All Source RFP. In addition to conventional natural gas generation, the Company will be initiating contract negotiations during 2019 for power purchase agreements from both solar and battery storage resources. Furthermore, the Company will pursue negotiations for possible additional solar and wind purchase power if there are potential energy cost savings.

Power Sales Contracts
The Company has entered into several short-term (three months or less) off-system sales contracts throughout 2018.
Franchises and Significant Customers
Franchises
The Company operates under franchise agreements with several cities in its service territory, including one with El Paso, Texas, the largest city it serves. The franchise agreement allows the Company to utilize public rights-of-way necessary to serve its customers within El Paso. Pursuant to the El Paso franchise agreement, the Company pays to the City of El Paso, on a quarterly basis, a fee equal to 5.00% of gross revenues the Company receives for the generation, transmission and distribution of electrical energy and other services within the city. The 2005 El Paso franchise agreement set the franchise fee at 3.25% of gross revenues, but that amount has since been adjusted by two amendments. The 2010 amendment added an incremental fee equal to 0.75% of gross revenues to be placed in a restricted fund to be used by the city solely for economic development and renewable energy purposes. The 2018 amendment, approved on March 20, 2018, and applicable to bills issued on or after October 1, 2018, increased the dedicated incremental fee by 1.00% of gross revenues and extended the term of the franchise agreement by 30 years. Any assignment of the franchise agreement, including a deemed assignment as a result of a change in control of the Company, requires the consent of the City of El Paso. The El Paso franchise agreement is set to expire on July 31, 2060.
The Company does not have a written franchise agreement with Las Cruces, New Mexico, the second largest city in its service territory. The Company utilizes public rights-of-way necessary to service its customers within Las Cruces under an implied franchise pursuant to state law by satisfying all obligations under the franchise agreement that expired on April 30, 2009. The Company pays the City of Las Cruces a franchise fee of 2.00% of gross revenues the Company receives from services within the City of Las Cruces.
The Company also maintains franchise agreements with other municipalities, and applicable counties, within its service territories.
Military Installations
The Company serves HAFB, White Sands and Fort Bliss. These military installations represent approximately 2.6% of the Company's annual retail revenues. In July 2014, the Company signed an agreement with Fort Bliss under which Fort Bliss takes retail electric service from the Company under the applicable Texas tariffs. The Company serves White Sands under the applicable New Mexico tariffs. In August 2016, the Company signed a contract with HAFB under which the Company provides retail electric service and limited wheeling services to HAFB under the applicable New Mexico tariffs. As stated in the contract, HAFB will purchase the full output of a Company-owned 5 MW solar facility upon its completed construction, which occurred on October 18, 2018. HAFB's other power requirements are provided under the applicable New Mexico tariffs with limited wheeling services under the contract.
