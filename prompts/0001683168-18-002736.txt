Item 1. Business.
History
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of Colorado in August 1998 under the name “Network Acquisitions, Inc.” We changed our name to Cavion Technologies, Inc. in February 1999 and subsequently to Concord Ventures, Inc. in October 2006.
 
On December 21, 2000, we filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In connection with the filing, on February 16, 2001, we sold our entire business, and all of our assets, for the benefit of our creditors. After the sale, we still had liabilities of $8.4 million and were subsequently dismissed by the Court from the Chapter 11 reorganization, effective March 13, 2001, at which time the last of our remaining directors resigned. On March 13, 2001, we had no business or other source of income, no assets, no employees or directors, outstanding liabilities of approximately $8.4 million and had terminated our duty to file reports under securities law. In February 2008, we were re-listed on the OTC Bulletin Board.
 
In April 2010, we re-domiciled in Delaware under the name CCVG, Inc. (“CCVG”). Effective December 31, 2010, CCVG completed an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization y (the “Reorganization") which provided for the merger of two of our wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result of this reorganization our name was changes to “Golden Dragon Inc.”, which became the surviving publicly quoted parent holding company.
 
On May 9, 2014, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with CannaPharmaRX, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“Canna Colorado”), and David Cutler, a former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and director of our Company. Under the Share Purchase Agreement, Canna Colorado purchased 1,421,120 shares of our common stock from Mr. Cutler and an additional 9,000,000 restricted common shares directly from us.
 
On May 15, 2014, as amended and effective January 29, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger”) pursuant to which Canna Colorado became a subsidiary of our Company. In October 2014, we changed our legal name to “CannaPharmaRx, Inc.”
 
Pursuant to the Merger, all of the shares of our common stock previously owned by Canna Colorado were cancelled. As a result of the aforesaid transactions we became an early-stage pharmaceutical company whose purpose was to advance cannabinoid research and discovery using proprietary formulation and drug delivery technology then under development. 
 
In April 2016, we ceased operations. Our then management resigned their respective positions with our Company, with the exception of Mr. Gary Herick, who remains as one of our officers and directors.

Employees
 
During 2016 and as of the date of this report we have no employees except our current management. See “Part III, Item 10, Management” below.
 
Competition
 
We are competing with other publicly held companies who are also seeking to acquire or otherwise consolidate with an existing business. We believe that the only thing that may separate us from these competitors is our interest in the cannabis industry, but there are no assurances that this provides any competitive edge. Most of our competitors have greater resources, both financial and otherwise, than the resources presently available to us.
Intellectual Property
 
We currently do not hold any patents or patent applications. We hold one registered trademark, RECRUIT Registry™. This report contains additional trademarks, service marks, or trade names of others. Our use or display of other parties’ trademarks, service marks or trade names is not intended to imply and does not imply a relationship with, or endorsement of, such parties. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention provisions. Further, we generally require confidentiality agreements from business partners and other third parties that receive our confidential information.
