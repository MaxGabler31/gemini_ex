Item 1. Description of Business 
Company Information
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming on June 3, 2015. We formed Shift Human Capital Management Inc., d/b/a/ ShiftableHR, a wholly-owned subsidiary, in December 2015. Our principal executive office is located at 1 Venture, Suite 150, Irvine, CA 92618, and our telephone number is (888) 798-9100. Our website address is www.shiftpixy.com. We do not incorporate the information on or accessible through our website into this Report, and you should not consider any information on, or that can be accessed through, our website a part of this Report.
Business
 
The Company is primarily a staffing enterprise, providing employment services solutions for businesses and workers in an environment in which shift or other part-time/temporary positions, commonly called “gigs,” are performed. 
 
The trend toward a Gig Economy has begun. A study by Ardent Partners confirms that the trend is significant, noting that nearly of the world’s total workforce is now considered ‘non-employee,’ which includes contingent/contract workers, temporary staff, gig workers, freelancers, professional services, and independent contractors.” Ardent Partners Ltd. “The State of Contingent Workforce Management 2016-2017: Adapting to a New World of Work.” October 2016. In the Gig Economy, businesses such as those in our current target market in the restaurant and hospitality industries often contract with independent contractor workers to perform less than full-time gig engagements, primarily in the form of shift work.
 
We provide our disruptive solution in the developing nextGEN economy primarily by absorbing our clients’ workers, who we may refer to as “shift workers,” “shifters,” “gig workers,” “worksite employees” and “assigned employees,” as ShiftPixy employees and make those employees available to the client to work the same jobs, as employees of ShiftPixy, thereby shouldering a substantial portion of the employment-related compliance responsibilities. This arrangement also benefits the gig workers who have now become ShiftPixy employees. We plan to allow shifters placed with one of ShiftPixy’s clients to access other shift work with other ShiftPixy clients. In addition to the benefits of working not as independent contractors but as employees, enjoying the protections of workers’ compensation coverage and employment laws as well as the calculation and remittance of applicable employment taxes among other benefits, shifters are also enabled to participate in ShiftPixy’s benefit plan offerings, including minimum essential health insurance coverage plans and a 401(k) plan.
 
The heart of ShiftPixy’s employment service solutions will be a mobile platform through which, initially, ShiftPixy employees (and ultimately all shifters) will be enabled to find available shift work at ShiftPixy client locations, solving a problem of finding available shift work for both the shifters looking for additional shift work and business clients looking to fill open shifts.

The mobile app is one of the software components of what we call the mobile platform, and together with the ShiftPixy “Command Hub” and the client portal, is being developed, tested and released in stages. We have released and are using the onboarding feature of our software, which enables us to capture all application process related data regarding our assigned employees and to introduce employees to and integrate them into the ShiftPixy Ecosystem. The mobile platform features a Pixy chatbot that leverages artificial intelligence to aid in gathering the data from workers via a series of questions. Following completion of the questions, applicable onboarding paperwork is prepopulated with the data and prepared for signature. We use the app to gather even I-9 required documentation. 
 
Our next phase of development, planned to be offered to our clients during the fourth calendar quarter of 2018, is the implementation of the scheduling component of our software, which is being designed to enable each client worksite to schedule workers and to identify shift gaps that need to be filled. We again plan to leverage artificial intelligence to maintain schedules and fulfillment, using an active methodology to engage and move people to action. We plan to engage certain of our clients to begin using this functionality before the end of the fourth calendar quarter of 2018. 
 
The next succeeding phase of development, also planned to be completed in the fourth calendar quarter of 2018, includes the implementation of our shift intermediation functionality, which is designed to enable our shift workers to receive information regarding and to accept available shift work opportunities. We currently plan to have the onboarding, scheduling and shift intermediation functionalities operable and integrated across our platform by the end of the fourth calendar quarter of 2018; however, the intermediation functionality becomes useful only to the extent that we have meaningful numbers of available workers and client shift opportunities in the same geographic region, which we expect to begin to occur at the end of the fourth calendar quarter of 2018. Our goal is to have the mobile platform serve not only to enable our shift workers to secure additional shift work and our job provider clients to fill open shifts but also to attract new clients who see the value associated with being able to fill open shifts with a ready-to-hire workforce. This software is an important component of our overall ecosystem, and we are excited about our continued development.
 
The ShiftPixy solution provides compliance-oriented benefits for our business clients. A significant problem for businesses in the Gig Economy involves compliance with employment related regulations imposed by federal, state and local governments, including requirements associated with workers’ compensation insurance, and other traditional employment compliance issues, including the employer mandate provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”). The compliance challenges are often complicated by the actions of many employers in reducing workers’ hours as a means to avoid characterizing employees as “full-time.” Congress is considering amendments to or replacement of the ACA. As of the date of this filing, the ACA has not been formally amended or repealed; however, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 effectively eliminates the individual mandate provisions of the ACA, beginning in 2019. Employers still face regulatory issues and overhead costs for which we believe our services are a cost-effective solution. Also, we believe that a possible benefit to the repeal of the ACA employer mandate provisions may be to reduce our costs associated with the provision of health insurance coverage or payment of applicable penalties and enable us to pass a portion of the savings on to our clients, because we would no longer be subject to the employer mandate costs applicable to the ShiftPixy employees secured from our clients.

As part of our development strategy, in addition to our efforts to onboard clients as a staffing company, we are also onboarding clients via a professional employer organization (“PEO”) solution as well as administrative services only solutions through our wholly-owned subsidiary ShiftableHR. Ultimately, we intend to migrate these clients to the new nextGEN ShiftPixy solution described above. 
 
We are also joining the hot topic dialogue currently going on in the nextGEN Gig Economy about companies such as Uber and others who have been targeted by plaintiff’s attorneys and government agencies for allegedly mischaracterizing employees as independent contractors. We believe that our ShiftPixy business model is a perfect solution for these companies, because we acquire employer status with regard to the workers, not classifying them as independent contractors, and accordingly embracing the compliance obligations associated with being an employer.
 
ShiftPixy’s headquarters is currently situated in Irvine, California, from which it can reach the Southern California market, and the company has a modest staff in Phoenix. ShiftPixy recently opened an office in New York City, Austin, Texas, Chicago and the Orlando area from which its local sales/services representatives will secure and service clients in those areas, and it plans to open additional physical offices in the following locales: Las Vegas and Atlanta. 
   Through these office locations, we plan to engage more actively with clients through sales, marketing, employee onboarding, training and payroll processing, in each instance as necessary and appropriate to the applicable market.
 
These markets collectively account for or allow us to cover approximately 53% of our target market in the restaurant/hospitality sectors. (U.S. Department of Labor. Bureau of Labor Statistics. May 2015. Occupational Employment and Wages.). 
 
 We define a client as any business paying us to provide employees or employee related services. We are currently focused on clients in the restaurant and hospitality industries; however, we have clients in a variety of other industries as well. All have written client service agreements. The basic client agreement is substantially similar for all clients, with minor modifications to fit each client’s specific situation, and some differences to account for whether the engagement is with ShiftPixy or its wholly owned subsidiary, Shift Human Capital Management Inc.

We believe ShiftPixy’s anticipated business and revenue growth in the nextGEN Gig Economy will result from the following factors: 
 

· | Large Potential Market. There is a large potential market for ShiftPixy’s services. Current statistics show that there are over 13 million employees working in our current target market--the restaurant and hospitality industries. (U.S. Department of Labor. Bureau of Labor Statistics. September 2016. Table B-1: Employees on nonfarm payrolls by industry sector and selected industry detail: Accommodation and Food Services Industry Subsector). Compared to the total workforce in all industries, workers in the restaurant industry have a notably higher percentage of part-time workers. (National Restaurant Association. “News & Research: Restaurant middle class job growth 4x stronger than overall economy.” 13 January 2016). Of course, ShiftPixy plans, subject to workers’ compensation insurance coverage scope limitations, to expand its service offering into other industries as well, particularly where part-time work is a significant component of the applicable labor force, including the retail and health care, especially home health care, sectors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Rapid Rise of Independent Workers. The number of independent workers, totaling approximately 40 million in 2016, is expected to increase to 40% of the private, non-farm U.S. workforce by 2021. (MBO Partners. “America’s Independents / A Rising Economic Force / 2016 State of Independence in America Report / Sixth Annual.” 2016.) 
· | Technology Affecting and Attitudes towards Employment Related Engagements. Gig-economy platforms have changed the way part-time workers can identify and connect to work opportunities, and Millennials and others have embraced such technologies as a means to secure short-term employment related engagements. 


· | New ShiftPixy Mobile App is Designed to Provide Additional Benefits to Employers and NextGen Shift Workers. Millennials represent approximately 40% of the independent workforce who are over the age of 21 and who work 15 hours or more each week. (MBO Partners. “America’s Independents / A Rising Economic Force / 2016 State of Independence in America Report / Sixth Annual.” 2016.) Mindful that most of its shifters will be Millennials who connect with the outside world primarily through a mobile device, ShiftPixy is poised to significantly expand its business through the ShiftPixy mobile app. The ShiftPixy mobile app is a proprietary application downloaded to mobile devices, allowing ShiftPixy’s shifters to access shift work opportunities at all of ShiftPixy’s clients, not just their current restaurant or hospitality provider, and with an added feature, anticipated to be available in the second half of 2018, also allowing shift employees not working at its clients to access shift work opportunities at all of its clients. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Marketing Advantages from Strategic Insurance Provider Relationships. ShiftPixy receives marketing assistance from insurance brokerage and consulting firms, who introduce ShiftPixy to their insurance clients who are not aware of and who could benefit from ShiftPixy’s service offering. 


7


· | Ultimate Development of a ShiftPixy Ecosystem. ShiftPixy’s ultimate goal is to establish the first Ecosystem for employers with a large number of part-time workers, such as restaurants and hospitality businesses, and the ever-growing number of shift workers in the new Gig Economy. In a Gig Economy, part-time/temporary positions are common, and organizations contract with independent workers for short-term engagements. The goal of the Ecosystem is to allow the job provider to be flexible but compliant and the shift worker to manage and scale opportunity and income. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | ACA’s Current Impact on Existing and Potential New Clients. ShiftPixy’s existing and potential new clients are being significantly impacted by new requirements to provide employees health care coverage under the ACA, the relevant portions of which, with respect to impacting our existing and potential future clients, became effective January 1, 2015, and are likely to be in effect for the near future. As of the date of this filing, the ACA has not been formally amended or repealed; however, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 effectively eliminates the individual mandate provisions of the ACA, beginning in 2019.


· | If a potential client in our target market of the restaurant, hospitality and maintenance service business has 50 or more full-time equivalent employees, under the ACA, as currently applicable, it must offer benefits to full-time employees, a very expensive proposition.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Determining compliance requirements for industries such as restaurant, hospitality and maintenance service business, which employ many part time workers, is very challenging. 
· | Failure to offer coverage if required under the ACA, as it is currently comprised, can result in significant fines and other penalties. 

The Challenges of Staffing: Employers have difficulty filling open positions for shift work, and shifters have difficulty in securing shift work at times and dates they are available for such shift work.
The Challenges of Compliance: Employment law compliance requirements, including those related to the ACA, present a multi-obstacle ridden employment related compliance landscape, including the need to secure applicable workers’ compensation insurance coverage, to effect employment related tax withholdings and filings, and to navigate laws related to hiring and release of employees, including discrimination (race, color, national origin, sex, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and sexual orientation), sexual harassment, sick pay and time off, hours of work, minimum wage and overtime, gender pay differentials, immigration, safety, child labor, military leave, garnishment and other wage imposition processing, family and medical leave, COBRA, and unemployment claims.

A business can secure assistance in mitigating and even eliminating these challenges by contracting with ShiftPixy.
 
The ShiftPixy Solution: ShiftPixy is developing an Ecosystem comprised of a closed proprietary operating and processing system that helps restaurant or hospitality businesses (and in the future, businesses in additional industries wherein we plan to market our services) as well as shift workers by matching available shifts with available shift workers. The ShiftPixy Ecosystem provides the following benefits:

1. | Compliance: ShiftPixy assumes a substantial portion of a business’s employment regulatory compliance issues by having all of client shifter employees become employees of ShiftPixy. As the employer of the shifters, ShiftPixy can assist its clients with the staffing of their shift employee requirements. As ShiftPixy contracts to acquire employer status in relation to the workers, the employment regulatory compliance reporting, tracking and compliance responsibility becomes that of ShiftPixy and not the ShiftPixy client. Similarly, employee vs. independent contractor classification issues, workers’ compensation and other such employee law and regulation compliance issues become the responsibility of ShiftPixy rather than of the ShiftPixy client. Thus, using the ShiftPixy solution, ShiftPixy clients benefit not only from having the time previously spent on these employment compliance issues now available to grow their business, but they also enjoy the confidence of knowing that a staff of shifters, familiar with the client’s operations, will work at the client’s facility, albeit as employees of ShiftPixy. ShiftPixy clients can now focus their energy on the success of their business with assurance that their employment regulatory compliance issues are being addressed by ShiftPixy. The costs associated with the shifters are consolidated and charged, in effect, in conjunction with the shifters’ applicable rates of pay, allowing the clients to fund the employment related costs as the services are used--thereby avoiding various lump sum employment-related cost impositions.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Cost Containment: By having access to ShiftPixy’s entire part-time workforce, a client business is enabled to scale up or down more rapidly, making it easier to contain and manage operational costs. The two largest costs for a restaurant are food and labor. (National Restaurant Association “Restaurant Operations Report 2013-2014.) ShiftPixy charges a fixed percentage on wages that allows the client business to budget and plan more effectively without the full weight associated with the threats of penalties or missteps in dealing with employment law compliance related issues. 
3. | Cost Savings: ShiftPixy is able to use economies of scale in purchasing employer related solutions such as workers’ compensation and other benefits and in general can provide a shift worker to a business at a lower cost than the business can otherwise typically staff a particular position. 

 
ShiftPixy and its subsidiary collectively serve, as of August 31, 2017, an aggregate of approximately 141 clients with an aggregate of approximately 5,074 employees, including 4,048 employees of ShiftPixy and ShiftableHR that we provide to our clients and 1,026 employees of our clients for whom we provide only payroll administration services. None of these clients represents more than 10% of our revenues for fiscal year 2017.

A client is a business paying us to provide employees or employee related services. We are currently focused on clients in the restaurant and hospitality industries; however, we have clients in a variety of other industries as well. All have written client service agreements. The basic client agreement is substantially similar for all clients, with minor modifications to fit each client’s specific situation, and some differences to account for whether the engagement is with ShiftPixy or its wholly owned subsidiary, Shift Human Capital Management Inc.
 
ShiftPixy Human Capital Management Inc., d/b/a ShiftableHR
 
We formed this subsidiary in response to the need to have workers’ compensation policies written in the names of the clients (as may be required by some states) and otherwise in response to client needs for only administrative and processing services rather than the assignment of employees, particularly temporary employees, as offered by ShiftPixy. Under this subsidiary, under circumstances wherein the client remains as the sole employer of the subject employees, we act as a payroll processor, human resources consultant, and administrator of workers’ compensation coverages and claims (providing “administrative services only”). For administrative reasons, we believe that providing these services through a separate legal entity seemed advisable and required, and thus we formed the subsidiary to provide these services. Our goal is to migrate these clients to ShiftPixy.
 
These services are also available to businesses in all industries, not just the restaurant and hospitality industries. We hope that this mechanism may become a way to onboard new clients into the ShiftPixy Ecosystem when eligible clients to whom we are providing these services recognize the value of the services provided by ShiftPixy, the parent. As of August 31, 2017, ShiftableHR had 101 clients with 3,703 worksite employees, including 1,026 employees for whom we provide only payroll administration services, and ShiftPixy had 40 clients with 1,371 worksite employees. 
 
Potential New Marketing Opportunity
 
We have seen a potential new market based upon the issue of worker misclassification in the Gig Economy. Gig Economy companies such as Uber may typically classify the people working for them as “independent contractors” rather than “employees” for jobs (gigs). The companies can pay much less for services and in regulatory requirements if their workers are classified as independent contractors. Under state and federal employment laws, workers classified as employees are much more expensive for these companies. However, increasing litigation against Uber and others has increased awareness about this issue. ShiftPixy provides a solution by absorbing workers for these types of Gig Economy companies as employees of ShiftPixy, eliminating any risk of litigation, fines and other worker misclassification problems for these types of Gig Economy companies to the extent they become ShiftPixy clients.
Competition
 
Competitors to our business model include businesses such as ShiftGig, TaskRabbit and other comparable businesses that seek to arrange short-term work assignments for both employees and independent contractors. Competitors to our Ecosystem, which encompasses on a broad scale, the assignment of a workforce to businesses on a long-term basis, include businesses such as Insperity, TriNet Group, and Wageworks, and the assignment of individual workers to businesses generally on a short-term basis include businesses such as Kelly Services, ManpowerGroup, and Barrett Business Services. 
 
We believe our service offering competes effectively based on our strategy of combining an Ecosystem of employment services with the individualized ability to link trained workers to specific shift work opportunities. 
 


10

Governmental Regulation
 
Our business operates in an environment that is affected by numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to labor and employment matters, benefit plans and income and employment taxes. Moreover, because our client engagements involve some form of co-employer relationship with regard to the employees who provide services in employment to our clients, the application of such laws to these non-traditional employer relationships can become complex. Nearly all states have adopted laws or regulations regarding the licensure, registration or certifications of organizations that engage in co-employer relationships. We become subject to such laws and regulations when we enter into co-employer relationships with regard to employees providing services in the jurisdictions where such laws and regulations apply.
 
The following summarizes what we believe are the most important legal and regulatory aspects of our business:
 
Federal Regulations
 
Employer Status
 
We sponsor certain employee benefit plan offerings as the “employer” of our shift workers under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and ERISA. The multiple definitions of “employer” under both the Code and ERISA are not clear and most are defined in part by complex multi-factor tests under common law. We believe that we qualify as an “employer” of our shift workers under both the Code and ERISA, as well as various state regulations, but this status could be subject to challenge by various regulators. For additional information on employer status and its impact on our business and results of operations, refer to Item 1A of this Form 10-K/A, under the heading, “If ShiftPixy is not recognized as an employer of worksite employees under federal and state regulations, or we are deemed to be an insurance agent or third-party administrator, we and our clients could be adversely impacted.”
Affordable Care Act and Health Care Reform
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) was signed into law in March 2010. The ACA implemented substantial health care reforms with staggered effective dates continuing through 2020, and many provisions in the Act require the issuance of additional guidance from applicable federal government agencies and the states. There could be significant changes to the ACA and health care in general, including the potential modification, amendment or repeal of the ACA. For additional information on the ACA and its impact on our business and results of operations, refer to Item 1A of this Form 10-K/A, under the heading, “Failure to comply with, or changes in, laws and regulations applicable to our business, particularly potential changes to the ACA, could have a materially adverse effect on our marketing plan as well as our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.” As of the date of this filing, the ACA has not been formally amended or repealed; however, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 effectively eliminates the individual mandate provisions of the ACA, beginning in 2019 

11

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 
Maintaining the security of information regarding our employees is important to us as we sponsor employee benefit plans and may have access to personal health information of our employees. The manner in which we manage protected health information (PHI) is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH Act). HIPAA contains substantial restrictions and health data privacy, security and breach notification requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of PHI. Further, under the HITECH Act there are steep penalties and fines for HIPAA violations. Our health plans are covered entities under HIPAA, and we are therefore required to comply with HIPAA’s portability, privacy, and security requirements. For additional information regarding the information we collect, how we maintain the confidentiality of our clients’ and employees’ confidential information and the potential impact to our business if we fail to protect the confidentiality of such data, refer to Item 1A of this Form 10-K/A, under the heading, “We host, collect, use, transmit and store personal and business information, and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.”
Certified Professional Employer Organization (PEO)
 
With passage of the Small Business Efficiency Act in 2014, the U.S. Congress clarified the employer status of professional employer organizations that voluntarily become certified under this law for federal tax purposes under the Code. The IRS has started accepting applications for certification under the Code, and we are considering applying for certification of our subsidiary, ShiftableHR.
State Regulations
 
Nearly all states have adopted provisions for licensing, registration, certification or other formal recognition of co-employers. Such laws vary from state to state but generally provide for monitoring or ensuring the fiscal responsibility of the professional employer organization, and in some cases codify and clarify the co-employment relationship for unemployment, workers’ compensation and other purposes under state laws. The scope of the laws and regulations of states is such that it encompasses the activities of ShiftPixy, Inc., as well as its subsidiary, ShiftableHR. In addition, many state laws require guarantees by ShiftPixy, Inc. of the activities of its subsidiary, ShiftableHR, and in some states we may seek licensure, registration or certification, as applicable, of ShiftPixy, Inc., with its subsidiary, ShiftableHR, because the financials for both organizations are consolidated. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements in the states wherein we are conducting business. 
 
We must also comply with state unemployment tax requirements where our clients are located. State unemployment taxes are based on taxable wages and tax rates assigned by each state. The tax rates vary by state and are determined, in part, based on our prior years’ compensation and unemployment claims experience in each state. Certain rates are also determined, in part, by each client’s own compensation and unemployment claims experience. In addition, states have the ability under law to increase unemployment tax rates, including retroactively, to cover deficiencies in the unemployment tax funds.

Intellectual Property
 
ShiftPixy has registered a trademark in its name, and a copyright in its “Pixy” image. In addition, the company has submitted a patent application in connection with certain features of its mobile application. ShiftPixy has other intellectual property and related rights as well, particularly in connection with our software. We believe that our intellectual property is of considerable importance to our business.
Employees
 
As of August 31, 2017, we employed 41 people on a full-time basis in our corporate offices, and we served approximately 5,074 active, paid worksite employees.

 Significant Developments in 2018 
 
 New Sales Offices 
 
 ShiftPixy recently opened offices in New York City, Austin, Texas, Orlando and Chicago from which its local sales/service representatives will secure and service clients in those areas, and it plans to open additional physical offices in the following locales: Las Vegas and Atlanta. 
 Software Development 
 
 The heart of ShiftPixy’s employment service solutions is a technology platform, including a mobile app, through which ShiftPixy employees (and in the future, shift workers not currently in our Ecosystem) will be enabled to find available shift work at ShiftPixy client locations, solving a problem of finding available shift work for both the shifters looking for additional shift work and business clients looking to fill open shifts. 
 
 The mobile app is one of the software components of what we call the mobile platform, and together with the ShiftPixy “Command Hub” and the client portal, is being developed, tested and released in stages. We have released and are using the onboarding feature of our software, which enables us to capture all application process related data regarding our assigned employees and to introduce employees to and integrate them into the ShiftPixy Ecosystem. Our new employees no longer have to fill out the burdensome pile of required new employee paperwork. By leveraging artificial intelligence capabilities, new hires are guided by a conversation with a “Pixy” chatbot that asks the necessary questions and generates the required employment documents in a highly personal and engaging way. 
 
 Following completion of the questions, applicable onboarding paperwork is prepopulated with the data and prepared for the employee’s signature to be affixed digitally via the app as well. We use the app to gather even I-9 required documentation . 
 
 Our next phase of development, planned to be completed in the beginning of the fourth calendar quarter of 2018, is the implementation of the scheduling component of our software, which is being designed to enable each client worksite to schedule workers and to identify shift gaps that need to be filled. We again plan to leverage artificial intelligence to maintain schedules and fulfillment, using an active methodology to engage and move people to action. We plan to engage certain of our clients to begin using this functionality before the end of the fourth calendar quarter of 2018. 
 
 The next succeeding phase of development, also planned to be completed in the fourth calendar quarter of 2018, includes the implementation of our shift intermediation functionality, which is designed to enable our shift workers to receive information regarding and to accept available shift work opportunities. We currently plan to have the onboarding, scheduling and shift intermediation functionalities operable and integrated across our platform during the fourth calendar quarter of 2018; however, the intermediation functionality becomes useful only to the extent that we have meaningful numbers of available workers and client shift opportunities in the same geographic region, which we expect to begin to occur at the end of the fourth calendar quarter of 2018. Our goal is to have the mobile platform serve not only to enable our shift workers to secure additional shift work and our job provider clients to fill open shifts but also to attract new clients who see the value associated with being able to fill open shifts with a ready-to-hire workforce. This software is an important component of our overall ecosystem, and we are excited about our continued development. 
 
 We also plan to begin using the “delivery features” of our mobile platform during the third calendar quarter of 2018. Our technology and approach to human capital management allows the company a unique window into the daily demands of “Quick Service Restaurants” (“QSR”) operators and the ability to extend our technology and engagement to enable this unique self-delivery proposition. ShiftPixy’s new driver management layer for operators in the ShiftPixy ecosystem will now allow clients to use their own team members to deliver a brand intended customer experience. ShiftPixy has taken the compliance, management and insurance issues related to the support of a delivery option and created a turnkey self-delivery opportunity. This would allow our clients to enjoy the income growth from delivery and preserve their customer experience and their brand. The first phase of this component of our platform will be driver onboarding, which we plan to use by the third calendar quarter of 2018. Following completion of this phase, we plan to add features that enhance the capability of our mobile application to track and manage the delivery process. The enhanced features will “micro metering” of essential commercial insurance coverages required by our operator clients-namely workers’ compensation and auto coverages on a delivery-by-delivery basis.
