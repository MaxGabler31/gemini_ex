Business Overview
 
The Company had previously intended to market, package, and distribute, Hemp-CBD based products. Our mission was to Create High End, Unique Content and aggregate all relevant CBD content in the Nutraceutical and Pharmaceutical markets. In 2022, after the effects of Covid, the Company decided to change direction and acquire companies in the green energy sector
 
On June 23, 2022, the Company executed a Letter of Intent with the shareholders of Progressus Clean Technologies, Inc. (“Progressus”), whereby the Company shall acquire substantially all of the issued and outstanding shares of Progressus, a private company incorporated in Delaware.
 
Progressus is a venture stage green technology company focused on the development of novel hydrogen generation and separation technologies. Progressus owns the rights to exclusive intellectual property that can enable the extraction of dilute amounts of hydrogen at high purity from a variety of different gas streams – often called “syngas”. Utilizing its unique cell design, fabrication, and membrane technology, oxygen free electrolysis is possible at industry leading efficiencies with an improved safety profile.
 
Green power and green hydrogen often wasted and/or curtailed because it is produced at off-peak periods, too dilute, or in such small quantities that it can’t be extracted and used in a meaningful way. As such, it is often burned or deemed a contaminant. Governments, natural gas utilities, large industrials and the public are all calling for technological innovation and Progressus has a solution. Progressus has partnered with industry leading experts that have allowed accelerated technology development that is capable of addressing these problems.
 
Progressus, which is the Latin word for advancement, is very appropriate because the company has the goal to transform the way the world thinks about green energy. For homes, businesses, and industry alike, Progressus technology can assist with meeting the green energy demands of the future.
