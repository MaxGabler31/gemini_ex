Item 1. Business
General
 Spirit of Texas Bancshares, Inc. (the “Company” or “Spirit”) is a Texas corporation and a registered bank holding company located in the Houston metropolitan area with headquarters in Conroe, Texas. We offer a broad range of commercial and retail banking services through our wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Spirit of Texas Bank SSB (the “Bank” and together with the Company, “we,” “our” or “us”). We operate through 23 full-service branches located primarily in the Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2018, we had total assets of $1.47 billion, loans held for investment of $1.09 billion, total deposits of $1.18 billion and total stockholders’ equity of $198.8 million.
 We are a business-focused bank that delivers relationship-driven financial services to small and medium-sized businesses and individuals in our market areas. Our philosophy is to target commercial customers whose businesses generate between $3 to $30 million of annual revenue. Our product offerings consist of a wide range of commercial products, including term loans and operating lines of credit to commercial and industrial companies; commercial real estate loans; construction and development loans; SBA loans; commercial deposit accounts; and treasury management services. In addition, our retail offerings include consumer loans, 1-4 single family residential real estate loans and retail deposit products.
 Since our inception in 2008, we have implemented a growth strategy that includes organic loan and deposit generation through the establishment of de novo branches, as well as strategic acquisitions that have either strengthened our presence in existing markets or expanded our operations into new markets with attractive business prospects.
 We operate in one reportable segment of business, community banking, which includes Spirit of Texas Bank SSB, our sole banking subsidiary. 
 Acquisition Activities
 On November 14, 2018, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of July 19, 2018, by and between the Company and Comanche National Corporation, a Texas corporation (“Comanche”), Comanche merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”).  Immediately after the Merger, Comanche National Corporation of Delaware, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Comanche, merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation, and The Comanche National Bank merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank continuing as the surviving bank (collectively, the “Comanche acquisition”).
Definitive Agreement with Beeville
 On November 27, 2018, the Company and First Beeville Financial Corporation, a Texas corporation (“Beeville”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Beeville Reorganization Agreement”), providing for the acquisition by Spirit of Beeville through the merger of Beeville with and into Spirit, with Spirit surviving the merger (the “Beeville acquisition”). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Beeville Reorganization Agreement, which has been approved by the Board of Directors of each of Spirit and Beeville, Beeville shareholders will have the right to receive, in the aggregate (i) $32,375,000 in cash and (ii) 1,579,268 shares of Spirit common stock (each subject to adjustment as described in the Beeville Reorganization Agreement) (collectively, the “Merger Consideration”). Based on the closing price of $19.81 for Spirit common stock on November 26, 2018, the transaction would have an aggregate value of $63.7 million.
 The Beeville Reorganization Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Beeville, including, among others, if the Beeville acquisition is not consummated on or before May 26, 2019 (subject to extension as described in the Beeville Reorganization Agreement) or if the requisite approval of Beeville’s shareholders is not obtained. In addition, Beeville may be required to pay a termination fee of $2,500,000 in the event of a termination of the Beeville Reorganization Agreement under certain circumstances.

Market Area
 We began operations in November 2008 with the acquisition of First Bank of Snook, a community bank with two branches, one in the Bryan/College Station metropolitan area and one in Snook, Texas. Immediately following this initial acquisition, we opened a business banking office with an established commercial lending team and SBA team. We quickly expanded into the Central Houston and North Houston markets through de novo branching and branch acquisitions. Early in our development, we identified the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area as a strategic opportunity for expansion and an area with strong growth potential based on attractive demographics and market characteristics. In 2012, we expanded into Dallas with a team of bankers with whom our management team had previously worked, by establishing two loan production offices, or LPOs. We further expanded our presence in the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area in 2013 through (i) a whole-bank acquisition and, (ii) the conversion of our LPOs into two full-service branches. At the end of 2013, we acquired a bank in The Woodlands, which is located in North Houston, in a FDIC-assisted transaction. In 2016, we acquired an additional branch in a strategic location in The Woodlands. Most recently, on November 14, 2018, we acquired Comanche National Corporation and its subsidiary, The Comanche National Bank (together “Comanche”) expanding our presence in the North Central Texas region. 
 Today, we have 23 full-service branches located in four Texas markets—the Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth and Bryan/College Station metropolitan areas and North Central Texas. We believe our exposure to these dynamic and complementary markets provides us with economic diversification and the opportunity for expansion across Texas.
 Market Share
 Our top three market areas include the Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land MSA, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington MSA and College Station-Bryan MSA. As of June 30, 2018, our deposit market share in each of these respective markets was 0.22%, 0.06% and 4.00%. Overall, in the State of Texas, we rank 48th in total deposits according to SNL Financial.
Competition
 The banking business is highly competitive, and our profitability will depend principally upon our ability to compete with other banks and non-bank financial institutions located in each of our banking center locations for lending opportunities, deposit funds, bankers and acquisition candidates. Our banking competitors in our target markets include various community banks and national and regional banks. There were over 450 FDIC-insured depository institutions that operate in the State of Texas as of December 31, 2018. 
 We are subject to vigorous competition in all aspects of our business from banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, finance companies, credit unions and other providers of financial services, such as money market mutual funds, brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, asset-based non-bank lenders, insurance companies and certain other non-financial entities, including retail stores which may maintain their own credit programs and certain governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing than we can. Many of the banks and other financial institutions with which we compete have significantly greater financial resources, marketing capability and name recognition than us and operate on a local, statewide, regional or nationwide basis.
 Our strategy to compete effectively in our markets is to emphasize our identity as a community-oriented bank in contrast to larger, national and regional banks. As a community bank, we can respond to loan requests quickly and flexibly through decisions made locally. Our marketing strategy is relationship and referral-based. We rely heavily on our bankers and the efforts of our officers and directors for building and strengthening those relationships. Additionally, our bankers, directors and officers are actively involved in our primary markets and are a strong source of introductions and referrals.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 289 employees of which 279 were full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a union. Management believes that our relationship with employees is good.

Lending Activities
 Lending Limits. Our lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by state and federal law. In general, we are subject to a legal limit on loans to a single borrower equal to 25% of the Bank’s tier 1 capital. This limit increases or decreases as the Bank’s capital increases or decreases. As of December 31, 2018, our legal lending limit was $35.0 million and our largest relationship was $9.6 million. In order to ensure compliance with legal lending limits and in accordance with our strong risk management culture, we maintain internal lending limits that are significantly less than the legal lending limits. We are able to sell participations in our larger loans to other financial institutions, which allows us to manage the risk involved in these loans and to meet the lending needs of our customers requiring extensions of credit in excess of these limits.
 Credit Department. The Bank maintains a large credit department under the direction of the Bank’s Chief Credit Officer. The credit department prepares and provides in-depth credit administration reporting to the Bank’s Asset Quality Committee on a quarterly basis to aid the committee in monitoring and adjusting the Bank’s loan focus as it grows. In addition, the credit department provides analytical and underwriting services in support of the loan officers developing their respective loan portfolios. The credit department also serves as a training ground for the Bank’s newest credit analysts who will be used to support our most senior loan officers as they are further trained to be our future lending officers.
 Loan Review. The Bank has developed an internal loan review system called the Relationship Review Process. Generally, all loan relationships greater than $500 thousand are reviewed by the loan officer at least annually. The loan officer will prepare a Relationship Review Memo that updates the credit file with new financials, review of the collateral status, and provide any meaningful commentary that documents changes in the borrower’s overall condition. For loan relationships greater than $2 million, the Relationship Review Process is done semi-annually. Upon completion of the Relationship Review Memo, the loan officer must present the memo to the Chief or Deputy Chief Credit Officer for final review, appropriate grade change, if needed, and then approval to place in the credit file for future reference. We believe this process gives the Chief Credit Officer and executive management strong insight into the underlying performance of the Bank’s loan portfolio allowing for accurate and proper real-time grading of the loan portfolio.
 Additionally, we employ an external third party loan review team to review up to 70% of the Bank’s entire loan portfolio on an annual basis. This review will include all large loan relationships, insider loans, all criticized loans and the Bank’s allowance for loan and lease losses calculations.
 Nonperforming Loans. We stringently monitor loans that are classified as nonperforming. Nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more, and loans renegotiated or restructured because of a borrower’s financial difficulties. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status if any of the following events occur: (a) the classification of a loan as nonaccrual internally or by regulatory examiners; (b) delinquency on principal for 90 days or more unless we are in the process of collection; (c) a balance remains after repossession of collateral; (d) notification of bankruptcy; or (e) we determine that nonaccrual status is appropriate.
 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses (“allowance”) is maintained at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb all probable losses on loans then present in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is affected by: (1) loan charge-offs, which decrease the allowance; (2) recoveries on loans previously charged-off, which increase the allowance; and (3) the provision of possible loan losses charged to income, which increases the allowance. In determining the provision for possible loan losses, we monitor fluctuations in the allowance resulting from actual charge-offs and recoveries, and we periodically review the size and composition of the loan portfolio in light of current and anticipated economic conditions in an effort to evaluate portfolio risks. The amount of the provision is based on our judgment of those risks. 
Investments
 We maintain a portfolio of investments, primarily in obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States and other taxable securities, to provide liquidity and an additional source of income, to manage interest rate risk, to meet pledging requirements and to meet regulatory capital requirements.
 7


We invest in U.S. Treasury bills and notes, as well as in securities of federally-sponsored agencies, such as Federal Home Loan Bank bonds. We may invest in federal funds, negotiable certificates of deposit, banker’s acceptances, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and municipal or other tax-free bonds. No investment in any of those instruments will exceed any applicable limitation imposed by law or regulation. Our asset/liability/investment committee reviews the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis in order to ensure that the investments conform to our internal policy set by our board.
 Sources of Funds
 General. Deposits traditionally have been our primary source of funds for our investment and lending activities. Our primary outside borrowing source is the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas (“FHLB” or “FHLB of Dallas”). Our additional sources of funds are scheduled loan payments, maturing investments, loan repayments, retained earnings, income on other earning assets and the proceeds of loan sales.
 Core Deposits. Our core deposits include checking accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, a variety of certificates of deposit and IRA accounts. To attract core deposits, we employ an aggressive marketing plan in our primary service areas and feature a broad product line and competitive offerings. The primary sources of core deposits are residents and businesses located in the markets we serve. We obtain these core deposits through personal solicitation by our lenders, officers and directors, direct mail solicitations and advertisements in the local media.
 Borrowings. To supplement our core deposits, we maintain borrowings consisting of advances from the FHLB of Dallas, a holding company line of credit with a third party lender and trust preferred securities. At December 31, 2018, FHLB advances totaled $77.6 million, or 6.1% of total liabilities. At December 31, 2018, we had additional capacity to borrow from the FHLB of $292.3 million. We had $20.0 million available to be drawn on the line of credit with the third party lender as of December 31, 2018. We also acquired trust preferred securities through the Comanche acquisition. At December 31, 2018, the balance outstanding of the trust preferred securities was $2.8 million. 
Other Banking Services
 We offer banking products and services that we believe are attractively priced and easily understood by our customers. In addition to traditional bank accounts such as checking, savings, money markets, and CDs, we offer a full range of ancillary banking services, including a full suite of treasury management services, consumer and commercial online banking services, mobile applications, safe deposit boxes, wire transfer services, debit cards and ATM access. Merchant services (credit card processing) and co-branded credit card services are offered through a correspondent bank relationship. We do not exercise trust powers.
REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
 The following is a general summary of the material aspects of certain statutes and regulations applicable to our Company and the Bank. These summary descriptions are not complete, and you should refer to the full text of the statutes, regulations, and corresponding guidance for more information. These statutes and regulations are subject to change, and additional statutes, regulations, and corresponding guidance may be adopted. We are unable to predict these future changes or the effects, if any, that these changes could have on our business, revenues, and financial results.
General
 We are extensively regulated under United States federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the TDSML, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the CFPB. Furthermore, tax laws administered by the IRS, and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), securities laws administered by the SEC and state securities authorities and AML laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or Treasury, also impact our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and rules are significant to our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty.

Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of banks, their holding companies and their affiliates. These laws are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers and the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) rather than for shareholders. Federal and state laws, and the related regulations of the bank regulatory agencies, affect, among other things, the scope of business, the kinds and amounts of investments banks may make, reserve requirements, capital levels relative to operations, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and acquire, dealings with insiders and affiliates and the payment of dividends. 
 This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that, while not publicly available, can affect the conduct and growth of their businesses.  These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management’s ability and performance, earnings, liquidity and various other factors. These regulatory agencies have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. 
 The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to the Company and the Bank. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.
 Holding Company Regulation
 As a regulated bank holding company, we are subject to various laws and regulations that affect our business. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, limit transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the transactions and business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividends that we can pay and require us to be a source of strength for the Bank. The Bank is also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including but not limited to requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, lending limits, limitations on branching activities, limitations on the types of investments that may be made, activities that may be engaged in, and types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank. Also, the Bank and certain of its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with extensions of credit, leases or sales of property, or furnishing products or services.
Permitted Activities
 Under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), a bank holding company that is not a financial holding company, as discussed below, is generally permitted to engage in, or acquire direct or indirect control of more than five percent of any class of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and that is engaged in, the following activities (in each case, subject to certain conditions and restrictions and prior approval of the Federal Reserve unless otherwise exempt): banking or managing or controlling banks; furnishing services to or performing services for our subsidiaries; and any activity that the Federal Reserve determines by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking, including:

• | factoring accounts receivable;
--+-------------------------------


• | making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating a nonbank depository institution, such as a savings association;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performing trust company functions;
--+------------------------------------


• | conducting financial and investment advisory activities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | conducting discount securities brokerage activities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing specified management consulting and counseling activities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

• | performing selected data processing services and support services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performing selected insurance underwriting activities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | providing certain community development activities (such as making investments in projects designed primarily to promote community welfare); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | issuing and selling money orders and similar consumer-type payment instruments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While the Federal Reserve has found these activities in the past acceptable for other bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve may not allow us to conduct any or all of these activities, which are reviewed by the Federal Reserve on a case by case basis upon application or notice by a bank holding company.
 The Federal Reserve has the authority to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company’s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries. Under the BHC Act, as amended by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, a bank holding company may also file an election with the Federal Reserve to become a financial holding company and engage in an expanded list of financial activities in addition to those described above, subject to certain eligibility requirements, including the requirement that the bank holding company be both “well capitalized” and “well managed”, as defined in the BHC Act and implementing regulations. Our company has not made an election to become a financial holding company.
 Acquisitions, Activities and Change in Control 
 The BHC Act generally requires the prior approval by the Federal Reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or a bank holding company’s acquisition of more than 5% of a class of voting securities of any additional bank or bank holding company or to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any additional bank or bank holding company. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the Federal Reserve considers, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position and managerial resources of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system, the applicant’s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”) and the effectiveness of all organizations involved in the merger or acquisition in combating money laundering activities. In addition, failure to implement or maintain adequate compliance programs could cause bank regulators not to approve an acquisition where regulatory approval is required or to prohibit an acquisition even if approval is not required.
 Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHC Act and the Dodd-Frank Act), the Federal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its insured depository institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state depository institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. Furthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to complete interstate mergers or acquisitions. For a discussion of the capital requirements, see “Regulatory Capital Requirements” below. 
 Federal law also prohibits any person or company from acquiring “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. “Control” is conclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, but may arise under certain circumstances between 5.00% and 24.99% ownership.

Bank Holding Company Obligations to Bank Subsidiaries
 Under current law and Federal Reserve policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its depository institution subsidiaries and to maintain resources adequate to support such subsidiaries, which could require us to commit resources to support the Bank in situations where additional investments in a bank may not otherwise be warranted. These situations include guaranteeing the compliance of an “undercapitalized” bank with its obligations under a capital restoration plan, as described further under “Bank Regulation—Capitalization Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action” below. As a result of these obligations, a bank holding company may be required to contribute additional capital to its subsidiaries including in the form of capital notes or other instruments that qualify as capital under regulatory rules. Any such loan from a holding company to a subsidiary bank is likely to be unsecured and subordinated to the bank’s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the bank.
Restrictions on Bank Holding Company Dividends
 The Federal Reserve’s policy regarding dividends is that a bank holding company should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and should not declare or pay a cash dividend which would impose undue pressure on the capital of any bank subsidiary or would be funded only through borrowing or other arrangements that might adversely affect a bank holding company’s financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if:

• | its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Should an insured depository institution controlled by a bank holding company be “significantly undercapitalized” under the applicable federal bank capital ratios, or if the bank subsidiary is “undercapitalized” and has failed to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or has materially failed to implement such a plan, federal banking regulators (in the case of the Bank, the FDIC) may choose to require prior Federal Reserve approval for any capital distribution by the bank holding company. Further, the capital conservation buffer may place additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends. For more information, see “Bank Regulation—Capitalization Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action” below.
 Generally, a Texas corporation may not make distributions to its shareholders if (i) after giving effect to the dividend, the corporation would be insolvent, or (ii) the amount of the dividend exceeds the surplus of the corporation. Dividends may be declared and paid in a corporation’s own treasury shares that have been reacquired by the corporation’s own authorized but unissued shares out of the surplus of the corporation upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. In addition, since our legal entity is separate and distinct from the Bank and does not conduct stand-alone operations, our ability to pay dividends depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us, which is also subject to regulatory restrictions as described below in “Bank Regulation—Bank Dividends.”
 Capital Regulations
 The federal banking agencies have adopted risk-based capital adequacy guidelines for banks and bank holding companies. These risk-based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets, and to achieve greater consistency in evaluating the capital adequacy of major banks throughout the world.
 11


In July 2013, federal banking regulators issued final rules, or the Basel III Capital Rules, establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules implement the Basel Committee’s December 2010 framework for strengthening international capital standards and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective on January 1, 2015 and became fully phased-in as of January 1, 2019.  In addition to establishing new minimum capital requirements, the Basel III Capital Rules implement a capital conservation buffer on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements that must be met in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives. This buffer must consist solely of tier 1 common equity, but the buffer applies to all three risk-based ratios (CET 1 Capital, tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer was phased in incrementally over time, becoming fully effective on January 1, 2019, and consists of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.  
 Accordingly, the Basel III Capital Rules require the following minimum capital requirements:
  
• | a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 Capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%, plus the capital conservation buffer, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a leverage ratio of 4%.
--+------------------------

 Management believes that our company and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the United States Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective.
 Under the Basel III Capital Rules, tier 1 capital is defined to include two components: common equity tier 1 capital and additional tier 1 capital. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (“CET1 Capital”) consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in tier 1 capital, such as non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock.
 The Basel III Capital Rules require certain deductions from or adjustments to capital. Deductions from CET1 Capital will be required for goodwill (net of associated deferred tax liabilities); intangible assets such as non-mortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships (net of associated deferred tax liabilities); deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards (net of any related valuations allowances and net of deferred tax liabilities); any gain on sale in connection with a securitization exposure; any defined benefit pension fund net asset (net of any associated deferred tax liabilities) held by a bank holding company (this provision does not apply to a bank or savings association); the aggregate amount of outstanding equity investments (including retained earnings) in financial subsidiaries; and identified losses. Other deductions are necessary from different levels of capital. The Basel III Capital Rules also increased the risk weight for certain assets, meaning that more capital must be held against such assets. For example, commercial real estate loans that do not meet certain underwriting requirements must be risk-weighted at 150%.
 Additionally, the Basel III Capital Rules provide for the deduction of three categories of assets: (i) deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that cannot be realized through net operating loss carrybacks (net of related valuation allowances and of deferred tax liabilities), (ii) mortgage servicing assets (net of associated deferred tax liabilities) and (iii) investments in more than 10% of the issued and outstanding common stock of unconsolidated financial institutions (net of associated deferred tax liabilities). The amount in each category that exceeds 10% of CET1 Capital must be deducted from CET1 Capital. The remaining, non-deducted amounts are then aggregated, and the amount by which this total amount exceeds 15% of CET1 Capital must be deducted from CET1 Capital. Amounts of minority investments in consolidated subsidiaries that exceed certain limits and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions may also have to be deducted from the category of capital to which such instruments belong.
 12


Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) is presumptively included in CET1 Capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital. The Basel III Capital Rules provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI and we determined to opt out.
 
On November 21, 2018, federal regulators released a proposed rulemaking that would, if enacted, provide certain banks and their holding companies with the option to elect out of complying with the Basel III Capital Rules. Under the proposal, a qualifying community banking organization would be eligible to elect the community bank leverage ratio framework if it has a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) greater than 9% at the time of election. 
 A qualifying community banking organization, or QCBO, is defined as a bank, a savings association, a bank holding company or a savings and loan holding company with:
  
• | total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | total off-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives other than credit derivatives and unconditionally cancelable commitments) of 25% or less of total consolidated assets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MSAs of 25% or less of CBLR tangible equity; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | temporary difference DTAs of 25% or less of CBLR tangible equity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 A QCBO may elect out of complying with the Basel III Capital Rules if, at the time of the election, the QCBO has a CBLR above 9%.  The numerator of the CBLR is referred to as “CBLR tangible equity” and is calculated as the QCBO’s total capital as reported in compliance with Call Report and FR Y-9C instructions, or Reporting Instructions (prior to including non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries) less:
  
• | Accumulated other comprehensive income (referred to in the industry as AOCI);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Intangible assets, calculated in accordance with Reporting Instructions, other than mortgage servicing assets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards net of any related valuations allowances.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The denominator of the CBLR is the QCBO’s average assets, calculated in accordance with Reporting Instructions and less intangible assets and deferred tax assets deducted from CBLR tangible equity.
 As of December 31, 2018, the Bank qualified to elect the community bank leverage ratio CBLR framework because it had a CBLR of greater than 9%.  The Company will continue to monitor this rulemaking.  If and when the rulemaking goes into effect, the Company and the Bank will consider whether it would be possible and advantageous at that time to elect to comply with the community bank leverage ratio CBLR framework.
 Tie in Arrangements 
 Federal law prohibits bank holding companies and any subsidiary banks from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit. For example, the Bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish any services, or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that (i) the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit, property or services from or to the Bank other than a loan, discount, deposit or trust services, (ii) the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit, property or service from or to the Company or the Bank, or (iii) the customer must not obtain some other credit, property or services from competitors, except reasonable requirements to assure soundness of credit extended.

Executive Compensation and Corporate Governance
 In 2010, the federal banking agencies issued guidance to regulated banks and holding companies intended to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at financial organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance is based on three “key principles” calling for incentive compensation plans to: appropriately balance risks and rewards; be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and be backed up by strong corporate governance. Further, in 2016 the federal banking regulators re-proposed rules that would prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss, and include certain prescribed standards for governance and risk management for incentive compensation for institutions, such as us, that have over $1 billion in consolidated assets.
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to include, at least once every three years, a separate non-binding “say-on-pay” vote in their proxy statement by which shareholders may vote on the compensation of the public company’s named executive officers. To allow shareholders to express their preferences on the frequency of the “say-on-pay” vote — whether it should occur every year, every other year, or every third year — the Dodd-Frank Act also requires public companies to conduct a separate shareholder vote on the future frequency of the “say-on-pay” vote. The vote on the frequency of “say-on-pay,” frequently referred to as “say-on-frequency,” must be held every six years. In addition, if such public companies are involved in a merger, acquisition, or consolidation, or if they propose to sell or dispose of all or substantially all of their assets, shareholders have a right to an advisory vote on any golden parachute arrangements in connection with such transaction (frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” vote). As an emerging growth company, we are not required to obtain “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency” or “say-on-golden-parachute” votes from our shareholders for so long as we remain an emerging growth company. Other provisions of the act may impact our corporate governance. For instance, the act requires the SEC to adopt rules prohibiting the listing of any equity security of a company that does not have an independent compensation committee; and requiring all exchange-traded companies to adopt clawback policies for incentive compensation paid to executive officers in the event of accounting restatements based on material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements.
 Bank Regulation
 The Bank is a state savings bank that is chartered by and headquartered in the State of Texas. The Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the TDSML and the FDIC. The TDSML supervises and regulates all areas of the Bank’s operations including, without limitation, the making of loans, the issuance of securities, the conduct of the Bank’s corporate affairs, the satisfaction of capital adequacy requirements, the payment of dividends, and the establishment or closing of banking offices. The FDIC is the Bank’s primary federal regulatory agency, which periodically examines the Bank’s operations and financial condition and compliance with federal consumer protection laws. In addition, the Bank’s deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the FDIC has certain enforcement powers over the Bank.
 As a state savings bank in Texas, the Bank is empowered by statute, subject to the limitations contained in those statutes, to take and pay interest on savings and time deposits, to accept demand deposits, to make loans on residential and other real estate, to make consumer and commercial loans, to invest, with certain limitations, in equity securities and in debt obligations of banks and corporations and to provide various other banking services for the benefit of the Bank’s clients. Various state consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank, including state usury laws and consumer credit laws.
 The Texas Finance Code further provides that, subject to the limitations established by rule of the Texas Finance Commission, a Texas savings bank may make any loan or investment or engage in any activity permitted under state law for a bank or savings and loan association or under federal law for a federal savings and loan association, savings bank or national bank if such institution’s principal office is located in Texas. This provision is commonly referred to as the “Expansion of Powers” provision of the Texas Finance Code applicable to state savings banks.
 Under federal law, a Texas state savings bank is a state bank. The FDICIA provides that no state bank or subsidiary thereof may engage as a principal in any activity not permitted for national banks, unless the institution complies with applicable capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity poses no significant risk to the DIF.
 14


Texas state-chartered savings banks are required to maintain at least 50 percent of their portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments as defined by 12 U.S.C. § 1467a(m)(4)(C) and other assets determined by the commissioner of the TDSML under rules adopted by the Finance Commission, to be substantially equivalent to qualified thrift investments or which further residential lending or community development.
 Capital Adequacy
 See “Holding Company Regulation—Capital Regulations” above.
 Capitalization Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action
 Federal law and regulations establish a capital-based regulatory framework designed to promote early intervention for troubled banks and require the FDIC to choose the least expensive resolution of bank failures. The capital-based regulatory framework contains five categories of regulatory capital requirements, including “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.” To qualify as a “well capitalized” institution for these purposes, a bank must have a leverage ratio of no less than 5%, a tier 1 capital ratio of no less than 8%, a CETI capital ratio of no less than 6.5% and a total risk-based capital ratio of no less than 10%, and a bank must not be under any order or directive from the appropriate regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level. Generally, a financial institution must be “well capitalized” before the Federal Reserve will approve an application by a bank holding company to acquire a bank or merge with a bank holding company. The FDIC applies the same requirement in approving bank merger applications.
 Immediately upon becoming undercapitalized, a depository institution becomes subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or FDIA, which: (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets; and (v) require prior approval of certain expansion proposals. Bank holding companies controlling financial institutions can be called upon to boost the institutions’ capital and to partially guarantee the institutions’ performance under their capital restoration plans. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions are necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the deposit insurance fund, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: (i) requiring the institution to raise additional capital; (ii) restricting transactions with affiliates; (iii) requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; (iv) requiring the institution to change and improve its management; (iv) prohibiting the acceptance of deposits from correspondent banks; (v) requiring prior Federal Reserve approval for any capital distribution by a bank holding company controlling the institution; and (vi) any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions.
 As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had sufficient capital to qualify as “well capitalized” under the requirements contained in the applicable regulations, policies and directives pertaining to capital adequacy, and it is unaware of any material violation or alleged material violation of these regulations, policies or directives. Rapid growth, poor loan portfolio performance, or poor earnings performance, or a combination of these factors, could change the Bank’s capital position in a relatively short period of time, making additional capital infusions necessary.
 It should be noted that the minimum ratios referred to above in this section are merely guidelines, and the Bank’s regulators possess the discretionary authority to require higher capital ratios.
 Bank Dividends
 The FDIC prohibits any distribution that would result in the Bank being “undercapitalized” (<4% leverage, <4.5% CET1 Risk-Based, <6% Tier 1 Risk-Based, or <8% Total Risk-Based). Unless the approval of the FDIC is obtained, the Bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during the calendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the sum of the Bank’s net income during the current calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two calendar years. Under Texas law, the Bank is permitted to declare and pay a dividend on capital stock only out of current or retained income.
 15


Insurance of Accounts and Other Assessments
 The Bank pays deposit insurance assessments to the DIF, which is determined through a risk-based assessment system. The Bank’s deposit accounts are currently insured by the DIF, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. 
 The Bank pays assessments to the FDIC for such deposit insurance. Under the current assessment system, the FDIC assigns an institution to a risk category based on the institution’s most recent supervisory and capital evaluations, which are designed to measure risk. For deposit insurance assessment purposes, an insured depository institution is placed in one of four risk categories each quarter. An institution’s assessment is determined by multiplying its assessment rate by its assessment base. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate a bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, agreement or condition imposed by the FDIC.
 In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, a federal government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. FICO assessments are set quarterly and the assessment rate was .140 (annual) basis points for the first quarter of 2019. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017 through 2019.
 Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act altered the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.  The FDIC had until September 3, 2020 to meet the 1.35% reserve ratio target, but it announced in November 2018 that the DIF had reached 1.36%, exceeding the 1.35% reserve ratio target.
 The Bank is also required to pay quarterly assessments to the TDSML to support the activities and operations of the agency.
 Audit Reports  
 For insured institutions with total assets of $1.0 billion or more, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, management’s certifications signed by our and the Bank’s chief executive officer and chief accounting or financial officer concerning management’s responsibility for the financial statements, and an attestation by the auditors regarding the Bank’s internal controls must be submitted. For institutions with total assets of more than $3.0 billion, independent auditors may be required to review quarterly financial statements. FDICIA requires that the Bank have an independent audit committee, consisting of outside directors only, or that we have an audit committee that is entirely independent. The committees of such institutions must include members with experience in banking or financial management, must have access to outside counsel and must not include representatives of large customers. The Company’s audit committee consists entirely of independent directors.
 Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates
 The Bank is subject to sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (“FRA”), and the Federal Reserve’s Regulation W, as made applicable to state nonmember banks by Section 18(j) of the FDIA. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such bank. Accordingly, transactions between the Bank, on the one hand, and our Company or any affiliates, on the other hand, will be subject to a number of restrictions. Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA impose restrictions and limitations on the Bank from engaging in certain types of transactions between the Bank, on the one hand, and our Company or any affiliates, on the other hand, including making extensions of credit to, or the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit on behalf of, our Company or other affiliates, the purchase of, or investment in, stock or other securities thereof, the taking of such securities as collateral for loans, and the purchase of assets of our Company or other non-bank affiliates. Such restrictions and limitations prevent our company or other affiliates from borrowing from the Bank unless the loans are secured by marketable obligations of designated amounts. Furthermore, such “covered transactions” are limited, individually, to ten percent (10%) of the Bank’s capital and surplus and in the aggregate to twenty percent (20%) of the Bank’s capital and surplus.
 16


All such transactions must be on terms that are no less favorable to the Bank than those that would be available from nonaffiliated third parties. Federal Reserve policies also forbid the payment by bank subsidiaries of management fees which are unreasonable in amount or exceed the fair market value of the services rendered or, if no market exists, actual costs plus a reasonable profit.
 Financial Subsidiaries
 Under the GLBA, subject to certain conditions imposed by their respective banking regulators, national and state-chartered banks are permitted to form “financial subsidiaries” that may conduct financial activities or activities incidental thereto, thereby permitting bank subsidiaries to engage in certain activities that previously were impermissible. The GLBA imposes several safeguards and restrictions on financial subsidiaries, including that the parent bank’s equity investment in the financial subsidiary be deducted from the bank’s assets and tangible equity for purposes of calculating the bank’s capital adequacy. In addition, the GLBA imposed new restrictions on transactions between a bank and its financial subsidiaries similar to restrictions applicable to transactions between banks and non-bank affiliates. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank did not have any financial subsidiaries.
Loans to Insiders
 Loans to executive officers, directors or to any person who directly or indirectly, or acting through or in concert with one or more persons, owns, controls or has the power to vote more than 10% of any class of voting securities of a bank, which the Bank refers to as “10% Shareholders,” or to any political or campaign committee the funds or services of which will benefit those executive officers, directors, or 10% Shareholders or which is controlled by those executive officers, directors or 10% Shareholders, are subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA and their corresponding regulations, which is referred to as Regulation O. Among other things, these loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those prevailing on transactions made to unaffiliated individuals and certain extensions of credit to those persons must first be approved in advance by a disinterested majority of the entire board of directors. Regulation O prohibits loans to any of those individuals where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15% of an institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral, or when the aggregate amount on all of the extensions of credit outstanding to all of these persons would exceed the Bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Section 22(g) identifies limited circumstances in which the Bank is permitted to extend credit to executive officers. Furthermore, the Bank must periodically report all loans made to directors and other insiders to the bank regulators. 
Branching
 The Dodd-Frank Act permits insured state banks to engage in interstate branching if the laws of the state where the new banking office is to be established would permit the establishment of the banking office if it were chartered by a bank in such state.  Under current Texas law, our Bank can establish a branch in Texas or in any other state. All branch applications of the Bank require prior approval of the TDSML and the FDIC.  Finally, the Company may also establish banking offices in other states by merging with banks or by purchasing banking offices of other banks in other states, subject to certain restrictions.
Liquidity Requirements
 Historically, regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III liquidity framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. The federal banking agencies adopted final Liquidity Coverage Ratio rules in September 2014 and proposed Net Stable Funding Ratio rules in May 2016. These rules introduced two liquidity related metrics: (i) Liquidity Coverage Ratio is intended to require financial institutions to maintain sufficient high-quality liquid resources to survive an acute stress scenario that lasts for one month; and (ii) Net Stable Funding Ratio is intended to require financial institutions to maintain a minimum amount of stable sources relative to the liquidity profiles of the institution’s assets and contingent liquidity needs over a one-year period.
 While the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the proposed Net Stable Funding Ratio rules apply only to the largest banking organizations in the country, certain elements may filter down and become applicable to or expected of all insured depository institutions and bank holding companies.
 17


Reserve Requirements
 In accordance with regulations of the Federal Reserve, all banking organizations are required to maintain average daily reserves at mandated ratios against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and Super NOW checking accounts). In addition, reserves must be maintained on certain non-personal time deposits. These reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in an account at a Federal Reserve Bank.
Brokered Deposits
 The FDIA restricts the use of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized. Under the applicable regulations, (1) a well-capitalized insured depository institution may solicit and accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit without restriction, (2) an adequately capitalized insured depository institution may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the FDIC, and (3) an undercapitalized insured depository institution may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit. The FDIC may, on a case-by-case basis and upon application by an adequately capitalized insured depository institution, waive the restriction on brokered deposits upon a finding that the acceptance of brokered deposits does not constitute an unsafe or unsound practice with respect to such institution. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was eligible to accept brokered deposits without a waiver from the FDIC.
Lending Limit
 Because of the availability of the savings bank expansion of powers language in the Texas Finance Code, savings banks have flexibility in the calculation of their applicable lending limit. The lending limit applicable to state banks in Texas is broader than the limit applicable to national banks. The Texas Finance Code adopts the lending limit applicable to federal savings associations under the Home Owners’ Loan Act for state savings banks, however, Texas savings bank are permitted under the expansion of power authority to adopt the legal lending limit applicable to national banks or state banks. Generally (subject to certain exceptions) the lending limit for loans to one person for national banks and federal savings associations is 15% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus if the loan is fully secured by readily marketable collateral. The lending limit for state banks in Texas is generally 25% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus plus an additional 15% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus if the loan is fully secured by readily marketable collateral. The adoption of the lending limit for national banks or state banks must incorporate the limitations applicable to the standard adopted.
 The Bank has adopted the lending limit applicable to state banks or 25% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus plus an additional 15% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus if the loan is fully secured by readily marketable collateral.
 Commercial Real Estate Lending Guidance
 The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (1) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (2) total reported loans secured by commercial real estate loans represent 300% or more of total capital and the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. Commercial real estate loans are land development and construction loans (including 1 to 4 family residential and commercial construction loans) and other land and development, commercial real estate loans secured by multifamily property, and certain nonfarm nonresidential property (excluding loans secured by owner-occupied properties) and certain loans to real estate investment trusts and unsecured loans to developers.
 18


Examination and Examination Fees
 The FDIC periodically examines and evaluates state savings banks that are not member banks of the Federal Reserve System. Based on such an examination, the Bank, among other things, may be required to revalue its assets and establish specific reserves to compensate for the difference between the Bank’s assessment and that of the FDIC. The TDSML also conducts examinations of state savings banks and generally conducts joint examinations with the FDIC. The TDSML charges assessments and fees which recover the costs of examining state savings banks, processing applications and other filings and covering direct and indirect expenses in regulating state savings banks. The federal banking agencies also have the authority to assess additional supervision fees.
 Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC
 Under federal law, financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering (“AML”) programs that include established internal policies, procedures and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and customer identification in their dealings with non-U.S. financial institutions and non-U.S. customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions, and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institution’s compliance with such obligations in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) is responsible for helping to ensure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. The regulatory authorities have imposed “cease and desist” orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations.
 Additionally, the USA PATRIOT Act requires each financial institution to develop a customer identification program, or CIP, as part of its AML program.  The key components of the CIP are identification, verification, government list comparison, notice and record retention.  The purpose of the CIP is to enable the financial institution to determine the true identity and anticipated account activity of each customer.  To make this determination, among other things, the financial institution must collect certain information from customers at the time they enter into the customer relationship with the financial institution.  This information must be verified within a reasonable time through documentary and non-documentary methods.  Furthermore, all customers must be screened against any CIP-related government lists of known or suspected terrorists.  Financial institutions are also required to comply with various reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  The Federal Reserve and the FDIC consider an applicant’s effectiveness in combating money laundering, among other factors, in connection with an application to approve a bank merger or acquisition of control of a bank or bank holding company.
 Likewise, OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others.  OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If we or the Bank find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we or the Bank must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.
 Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate AML and OFAC programs, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.
 Privacy and Data Security
 Under the GLBA, federal banking regulators adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The GLBA also directed federal regulators, including the FDIC, to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. The Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying clients in the event of a security breach.

• | Truth in Lending Act;
--+----------------------


• | Truth in Savings Act;
--+----------------------


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act;

--+------------

 Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous, and in addition, to those listed above. These federal, state and local laws regulate the manner in which financial institutions deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, or conducting other types of transactions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by state and local attorneys general and civil or criminal liability. The creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB by the Dodd-Frank Act has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer financial protection laws.
 Community Reinvestment Act
 The CRA and its corresponding regulations is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. The federal bank agencies examine and assign each bank a public CRA rating. The CRA then requires the federal banking agencies to take into account the federally-insured bank’s record in meeting the needs of its communities when considering an application by a bank to establish or relocate a branch or the bank or its holding company to conduct certain mergers or acquisitions. In the case of a bank holding company, the CRA performance record of all banks involved in the merger or acquisition are reviewed in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or to merge with any other financial holding company. An unsatisfactory record can substantially delay, block or impose conditions on the transaction. The Bank received a satisfactory rating on its most recent CRA assessment.
New Banking Reform Legislation
 The EGRRCPA directs the federal banking agencies to develop a specified CBLR (i.e., the ratio of a bank’s equity capital to its consolidated assets) of not less than 8% and not more than 10%. Banks and bank holding companies with less than $10 billion in total assets that maintain capital in excess of this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements. Federal banking agencies may consider a company’s risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the CBLR.
 20


Other key provisions of the EGRRCPA as it relates to community banks and bank holding companies include, but are not limited to: (i) designating mortgages held in portfolio as “qualified mortgages” for banks with less than $10 billion in assets, subject to certain documentation and product limitations; (ii) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets (and total trading assets and trading liabilities of 5% or less of total assets) from Volcker Rule requirements relating to proprietary trading; (iii) simplifying capital calculations for banks with less than $10 billion in assets by requiring federal banking agencies to establish a community bank leverage ratio of tangible equity to average consolidated assets of not less than 8% or more than 10%, and provide that banks that maintain tangible equity in excess of such ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with risk-based capital and leverage requirements; (iv) assisting smaller banks with obtaining stable funding by providing an exception for reciprocal deposits from FDIC restrictions on acceptance of brokered deposits; (v) raising the eligibility for use of short-form Call Reports from $1 billion to $5 billion in assets; (vi) clarifying definitions pertaining to HVCRE, which require higher capital allocations, so that only loans with increased risk are subject to higher risk weightings; and (vii) changing the eligibility for use of the small bank holding company policy statement from institutions with under $1 billion in assets to institutions with under $3 billion in assets.
 At this time, it is difficult to anticipate the continued impact this expansive legislation will have on the Company, its customers and the financial industry generally. To the extent the Dodd-Frank Act remains in place or is not further amended, it is likely to continue to increase the Company’s cost of doing business, limit the Bank’s permissible activities, and affect the competitive balance within the industry and market.
 Future Legislative Developments
 Various legislative acts are from time to time introduced in the U.S. Congress and the Texas Legislature. This legislation may change banking statutes and the environment in which we operate in substantial and unpredictable ways. With the change in U. S. Presidential administration, numerous regulations have been identified for potential revision, including laws and regulations associated with the Dodd-Frank Act and EGRRCPA. We cannot determine the ultimate effect that potential legislation, if enacted, or implementing regulations and interpretations with respect thereto, would have on our financial condition or results of operations.
