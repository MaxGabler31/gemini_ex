ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Chardan NexTech Acquisition 2 Corp. (“CNTQ,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 23, 2020. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity from our formation through December 31, 2021 relates to the Company’s formation and its initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”), which is described below, and subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, its search for a target company for a business combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial business combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest income from the marketable securities held in the trust account.
Initial Public Offering
On August 10, 2021, the registration statement (File No. 333-254010) relating to the Initial Public Offering of the Company, was declared effective by the SEC, and the Company subsequently filed, on August 11, 2021, a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-258699) pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) to cover the registration of additional units relating to the Initial Public Offering of the Company, which was effective immediately upon filing (collectively, the “Registration Statement”). On August 13, 2021, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 11,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value, and three-quarters of one redeemable warrant, with each whole public warrant entitling its holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $110,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,650,000 additional units to cover over-allotments, if any.
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with Warrant Holdings of 4,361,456 private warrants to purchase 4,361,456 shares of common stock, each at a price of $0.93 per private warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $4,052,000.
On August 13, 2021, a total of $111,650,000 of the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement were deposited in the trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders.
On August 16, 2021, the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering exercised their over-allotment option in full to purchase 1,650,000 additional units, at a price of $10.00 per unit. The closing of the issuance and sale of the units sold pursuant to the over-allotment option occurred on August 18, 2021. Simultaneously with the closing of the over-allotment option, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 266,402 private warrants, at a price of $0.93 per private warrant, to Warrant Holdings. Such private warrants were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
On of August 18, 2021, a total of $16,747,500, comprised of the proceeds of the sale of the units and the private warrants in connection with the full exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option, was added to the Company’s trust account, bringing the balance of the trust account to $128,397,500.

Background and Competitive Advantages
Having founded the third-ever publicly listed special purpose acquisition company in 2004, Chardan recognized early on that the traditional initial public offering process was broken. An initial public offering is a time and resource intensive process that lacks deal and price certainty. We believe that Chardan has an unmatched track record as a SPAC underwriter, sponsor (or co-sponsor) and business combination advisor, which we intend to leverage as SPACs continue to become more mainstream. Over the past year, we believe private company executives’ and stakeholders’ mindsets have fundamentally shifted as SPACs have provided a more effective and efficient path to access public markets and by extension, greater access to capital providers. In 2021, over 90 technology companies closed mergers with and went public via a special purpose acquisition vehicle, for an aggregate deal value greater than $200 billion. We believe private companies are realizing that they can be rewarded for providing greater transparency into their growth plans and can potentially capture further upside via the SPAC structure. The opportunity for disruptive technology companies to continue to take advantage of the public markets is clearly evident. Over $27 billion of venture capital funding was invested across over 750 deals into private technology companies in 2021. We aim to capitalize on the number of disruptive technology companies that are still private and capable of achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns in the public markets through our decades of SPAC experience.
Our Management Team
Our management team is led by co-founders Kerry Propper, Jonas Grossman and Alex Weil, each of whom have extensive investment and execution experience. Together with our management team, the Sponsor, and our board of directors, we are confident that the combined experience makes us uniquely situated to identify, source, negotiate and execute an initial business combination with a disruptive technology company.
Our management team is supported by Chardan’s team of investment banking professionals, which possesses extensive collective experience in corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, equity and debt capital markets, strategic consulting and operations.
Chardan has an extensive track record in the SPAC market as an underwriter, sponsor, and advisor. Since 2004, Chardan has underwritten over 100 SPAC initial public offerings. Chardan has also been an advisor on over 25 SPAC business combination transactions, helping to close over $9 billion of deals. Chardan-advised SPACs have targeted a wide range of industries, including life sciences, healthcare services, technology hardware and software, FinTech, insurance, financial services, education, media and entertainment, industrials, materials, consumer staple, energy, hospitality, leisure, travel and dining sectors. Chardan has advised SPACs targeting both global and regional markets as well as those with more defined areas of focus in emerging and other geographic markets, including in North America. No SPAC that has either been sponsored or co-sponsored by Chardan, or for which Chardan has served as the lead underwriter, has liquidated to-date. In addition to its active advisory and underwriting business, Chardan’s principals have sponsored or co-sponsored 15 SPACs, eight of which have closed business combinations, three of which have announced business combinations, three of which are seeking a target, and one that is publicly filed.
Mr. Propper, our co-founder and chairman of our board of directors, was co-founder of Chardan and served as its chief executive officer and head of its investment bank from 2003 to 2015. He is a pioneer in the SPAC marketplace and has been an executive for seven SPACs, in addition to serving as a director or advisor to five SPACs. Since 2015, Mr. Propper has served as the chairman of Chardan’s board of directors and the co-founder and managing partner of ATW Partners, a growth-focused investment firm. Mr. Propper also sits on the board of 340 Basics, Credit Sesame, and PierianDx among other boards.
Mr. Grossman, our co-founder, Director, Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer, leads Chardan’s capital markets team which as executed more than 400 transactions since inception. Mr. Grossman has nearly two decades of SPAC expertise. He has provided underwriting and business combination advisory services to more than 100 SPACs in a variety of industries. Mr. Grossman has been a member of the board of eight SPACs, of which on four he also has served as chief executive officer.

Mr. Weil, Chief Financial Officer and Director, has spent over two decades on Wall Street providing strategic advisory services to global companies, senior executives, boards of directors, and investors. He has advised on billions of dollars of transactions ranging from corporate divestitures and spin offs, innovative technology company acquisitions to larger, more complex mergers and acquisitions. Mr. Weil has participated or led a variety of transactions, and his extensive fintech and mergers and acquisitions expertise will help put us in a strong position to originate and structure profitable investments.
We have also assembled a group of independent directors who have a broad range of investment banking, management, leadership, operational and industry experience. Over the course of their careers, our directors have developed a broad international network of contacts and corporate relationships in the disruptive technology industry, and they have gained extensive experience with acquisitions, divestitures and corporate strategy and implementation. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.
Certain of our executive officers and directors also served as executive officers and directors of Chardan Healthcare Acquisition Corp., or Chardan Health SPAC 1, a blank check company that consummated its initial public offering in December 2018 and consummated its initial business combination with BiomX Ltd. (NYSE: PHGE) in October 2019.
Certain of our executive officers and directors also serve as executive officers and directors of Chardan Healthcare Acquisition 2 Corp., or Chardan Health SPAC 2, a blank check company that consummated its initial public offering in April 2020 and consummated its initial business combination with Renovacor, Inc. (NYSE: RCOR) in September 2021.
Certain of our executive officers and directors also serve as executive officers and directors of Ventoux CCM Acquisition Corp. (“Ventoux CCM”), a SPAC that consummated its initial public offering in December 2020 and entered into an agreement and plan of merger with E La Carte, Inc., d/b/a Presto, Inc., a Delaware corporation, in November 2021.
Our executive officer and director Jonas Grossman also serves as a director of CleanTech Acquisition Corp. (“CleanTech”), a SPAC that consummated its initial public offering in July 2021 and entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Nauticus Robotics, Inc., a Texas corporation, in December 2021.
Our executive officer and director Jonas Grossman also serves as a director of Monterey Bio Acquisition Corporation (“Monterey Bio”), a SPAC that has publicly filed its registration statement on Form S-1.
Certain of our executive officers and directors also serve as executive officers and directors of Chardan NexTech Acquisition Corp. (“Chardan NexTech 1”), a SPAC that has publicly filed its registration statement on Form S-1.
From time to time, Chardan acts as an underwriter for the initial public offering of SPACs and in addition to cash fees, Chardan receives equity in the form of private placement securities. Some of those SPACs may be competitive with our company as they look for targets in the same industries and geographies.

With respect to the foregoing descriptions, the past performance of Chardan and its affiliates and our management team is not a guarantee either (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. Messrs. Propper, Grossman and Weil have had management and/or board experience with blank check companies, and Messrs. Thomson and Boyle have agreed to serve as directors of Chardan NexTech 1. None of our other officers or directors, the Sponsor, nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees, or affiliates, have had management experience with blank check companies or special purpose acquisition corporations in the past. You should not rely on their respective historical records or performance of Chardan, its affiliates, or our management team as indicative of our future performance. Our officers and directors may have conflicts of interest with other entities to which they owe fiduciary or contractual obligations with respect to initial business combination opportunities, including for our officers with respect to Ventoux CCM, CleanTech, Monterey Bio, and Chardan NexTech 1 collectively which we refer to as the Affiliated SPACs. In order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise from multiple affiliations, our officers who are also officers of any of the Affiliated SPACs will be required to present all suitable target businesses to the Affiliated SPACs prior to presenting them to us, unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such individual solely in his capacity as an officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent such individual is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.
Business Strategy
Our management team’s objective is to generate attractive returns and create long-term value for our stockholders by applying a disciplined approach of identifying attractive business combination targets that we believe will benefit from becoming a publicly listed company and from the addition of strategic growth capital, management expertise and strategic insight. Our strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company in an industry that complements the experience and expertise of our management team, board of directors and advisors.
Our evaluation process leverages our co-founders’ and board’s network of industry, private equity Sponsor, and lending community relationships, as well as relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, restructuring advisors, attorneys and accountants, which we believe will provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. We are deploying a pro-active, thematic sourcing strategy and are focusing on companies where we believe the combination of our operating experience, relationships, capital and capital markets expertise can be catalysts to transform a target company and can help accelerate the target’s growth and performance.
Certain members of our management team, board and advisors have experience in:

· | all key activities of SPACs, Sponsoring, underwriting and mergers and acquisitions advisory;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

· | operating companies, setting and changing strategies, and identifying, monitoring and recruiting world-class talent;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

· | developing and growing companies, both organically and through acquisitions and strategic transactions and expanding the product range and geographic footprint of a number of target businesses;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

· | sourcing, structuring, acquiring and selling businesses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------

​

· | accessing the capital markets, including financing businesses and helping companies transition to public ownership;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

· | fostering relationships with sellers, capital providers and target management teams; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

· | executing transactions in multiple geographies and under varying economic and financial market conditions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Members of our management team and board, as well as our advisers continue to communicate with their network of relationships to articulate our initial business combination criteria, including the parameters of our search for a target business, to support the disciplined process of pursuing and reviewing promising leads.

Investment Criteria
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating candidates for our initial business combination. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating business combination opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that we believe:

· | has a strong competitive industry position with demonstrated competitive advantages to maintain barriers to entry;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

· | has a historic record of above average growth and strong free cash flow characteristics with high returns on capital;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

· | has a strong, experienced management team which would benefit from our management’s network or expertise, such as additional management expertise, capital structure optimization, acquisition advice or operational changes to drive improved financial performance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

· | is positioned for continued organic growth and may grow through bolt-on acquisitions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

· | is a fundamentally sound company with a proven track record;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

​

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

· | can benefit from being a publicly traded company, are prepared to be a publicly traded company and can utilize access to broader capital markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Acquisition Strategy
Rigorous and comprehensive due diligence on prospective business targets is particularly important for disruptive technology companies, which we are targeting. In the process of identifying a potential business target, we have been conducting and expect to continue to conduct, as applicable, an extensive due diligence review process which may encompass, as appropriate and among other things, meetings with incumbent management teams and stakeholders, business plan reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial, operational, legal and other information made available to us about the target and its industry. We also utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience.
Our officers and directors are not prohibited from becoming either a director or officer of any other SPAC with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the Exchange Act.
Initial business combination
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we may obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking or accounting firm as to the fair market value of a target business. We have also agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of the Sponsor. In addition, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.

We may, at our option, pursue a business combination opportunity jointly with Chardan or one or more entities affiliated with Chardan, which we refer to as an “Affiliated Joint Acquisition.” We do not expect that we would pursue any such opportunity with an Affiliated SPAC. Any such parties would co-invest only if (i) permitted by applicable regulatory and other legal limitations; (ii) we and Chardan considered a transaction to be mutually beneficial to us as well as the affiliated entity; and (iii) other business reasons exist to do so, such as the strategic merits of including such co-investors, the need for additional capital beyond the amount held in our trust account to fund the initial business combination and/or the desire to obtain committed capital for closing the initial business combination. An Affiliated Joint Acquisition may be effected through a co-investment with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the initial business combination by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities. We refer to this potential future issuance, or a similar issuance to other specified purchasers, as a “specified future issuance” throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any such Affiliated Joint Acquisition or specified future issuance would be in addition to, and would not include, the forward purchase securities issued pursuant to the forward purchase contract. The amount and other terms and conditions of any such specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. We are not obligated to make any specified future issuance and may determine not to do so. This is not an offer for any specified future issuance.
We have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate, to conduct any research or take any measures, directly or indirectly, to locate or contact a target business. Additionally, we may contact the prospective target businesses that the Affiliated SPACs have considered, but are no longer pursuing, if we become aware that the valuations, operations, profits or prospects of such target business, or the benefits of any potential transaction with such target business, would be attractive to our Company. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons, including an Affiliated Joint Acquisition as described above. However, we will only complete our initial business combination only if the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction.
If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% test, provided that in the event that the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

10



Effecting a business combination
General
We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and sale of the private warrants, our shares of common stock, new debt, proceeds from the sale of additional securities, or a combination of these, as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
If our initial business combination is paid for using shares of our common stock or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or the Nasdaq, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.

11



Sources of Target Businesses
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity groups, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources also may introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our final prospectus, filed with the SEC on August 12, 2021 and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, also may bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, other than Chardan pursuant to that certain business combination marketing agreement, dated as of August 10, 2021 (the “BCMA”), a copy of which is referenced as Exhibit 1.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may engage other firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. Although some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the acquired business following our initial business combination, if any, the presence or absence of any such arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with Chardan or its’ affiliates or the Sponsor, officers or directors, including an Affiliated Joint Acquisition. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with the Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an initial business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties to one or more other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entities, including Ventoux CCM, CleanTech, Monterey Bio and Chardan NexTech 1 Our officers and directors also may become aware of business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they owe certain fiduciary, contractual or other duties. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for one or more entities to which he or she has fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties, including Ventoux CCM, CleanTech, Monterey Bio and Chardan NexTech 1 he or she will honor these obligations and duties to present such business combination opportunity to such entities first, and only present it to us if such entities reject the opportunity and he or she determines to present the opportunity to us. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless (i) such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company, (ii) such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue and (iii) the director or officer is permitted to refer the opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.

12



We may, at our option, pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition. We do not expect that we would pursue any such opportunity with an Affiliated SPAC. Any such parties would co-invest only if (i) permitted by applicable regulatory and other legal limitations; (ii) we and the Sponsor considered a transaction to be mutually beneficial to us as well as the affiliated entity; and (iii) other business reasons exist to do so, such as the strategic merits of including such co-investors, the need for additional capital beyond the amount held in our trust account to fund the initial business combination and/or the desire to obtain committed capital for closing the initial business combination. An Affiliated Joint Acquisition may be effected through a co-investment with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the initial business combination by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities. Any such Affiliated Joint Acquisition or specified future issuance would be in addition to, and would not include, the forward purchase securities issued pursuant to the forward purchase contract.
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of our initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of mergers and acquisitions transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will be unable to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. We have also agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of the Sponsor. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% fair market value test. There is no basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination.
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.

13



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. Except for the fees payable pursuant to the BCMA, we will not pay any finders or consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

· | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. The future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. Consequently, members of our management team may not become a part of the target’s management team, and the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Further, it is not certain whether one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination. Moreover, members of our management team may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. Our key personnel may not remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that such additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination
In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to redeem their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to redeem any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that the public stockholders may tender any or all of their respective public shares rather than some pro rata portion of their respective shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we so choose and we are legally permitted to do so, we have the flexibility to avoid a stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC that will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules.
We may only redeem our public shares so long as our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the initial business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination.
We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of public shares redeemed or sold to us) and may force us to seek third-party financing that may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait until August 13, 2022 (or November 13, 2022 or February 13, 2023, as applicable, if the time period is extended) to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.
Our initial stockholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to redeem any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, if we sought stockholder approval of a proposed transaction, we would need only 4,743,751, or 37.5%, of the 12,650,000 public shares sold in the Initial Public Offering (including those shares sold pursuant to the over-allotment option) to be voted in favor of an initial business combination (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our initial business combination approved.
If we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates could make purchases of our public shares in the open market or in private transactions to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial stockholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of public shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.

15



Permitted Purchases of our Securities
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or any their respective affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of public shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions.
In the event our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates determine to make any such purchases at the time of a stockholder vote relating to our initial business combination, such purchases could have the effect of influencing the vote necessary to approve such transaction. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our public shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of our initial business combination.
The purpose of any such purchases of public shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
The Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors and/or any of their respective affiliates anticipate that they may identify the public stockholders with whom the Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the public stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by public stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that the Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their respective affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling public stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their public shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether such public stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination. Such persons would select the public stockholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of public shares available, the negotiated price per public share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per public share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per public share that a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. The Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their respective affiliates will purchase public shares only if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws

16



Any purchases by the Sponsor, officers, directors and/or any of their respective affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. The Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors and any of their respective affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements.
Redemption/Tender Rights
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to redeem their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to redeem any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we hold a meeting to approve an initial business combination, a public stockholder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek redemption of his shares.
Alternatively, if we engage in a tender offer, public stockholders will be provided the opportunity to sell their respective public shares to us in such tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly, this is the minimum amount of time that we would need to provide public stockholders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company.
We may also require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their public shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their public shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the public stockholder’s option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to stockholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, public stockholders would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver their respective shares if they wish to exercise their redemption rights. Under Delaware law and our bylaws, we are required to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a public stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise redemption rights. As a result, if we require public stockholders, who wish to redeem their public shares into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account, to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, public stockholders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for redemption. Accordingly, investors may not be able to exercise their redemption rights and may be forced to retain our public shares when they otherwise would not want to. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its public shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the public shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether to pass this cost on to the redeeming public stockholder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether we require public stockholders seeking to exercise redemption rights to deliver their public shares. The need to deliver public shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise redemption rights to deliver their public shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
Any request to redeem or tender such public shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if holders of public shares delivered their certificates in connection with an election of their redemption or tender and subsequently they decide prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such redemption rights or tender, they may simply request that the transfer agent return their respective certificates (physically or electronically).

17



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may only redeem our public shares so long as our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed initial business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed initial business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all public shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any public shares, and all public shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such public stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the public shares sold in the Initial Public Offering (“Excess Shares”). Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of our commons stock, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their public shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s public shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the public shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of public stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our public stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption or tender rights would not be entitled to redeem their public shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.

Liquidation of Trust Account if No Business Combination
If we do not complete a business combination by August 13, 2022 (or applicable later date, as described below), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. If we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination by August 13, 2022, our insiders or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to two times by an additional three months each time (i.e., until November 13, 2022 for a total of 15 months or until February 13, 2023, for a total of 18 months to complete a business combination); provided that, pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement we entered into with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, dated August 10, 2021 and referenced as Exhibit 10.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the only way to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination is for our insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, to deposit into the trust account $1,265,000 ($0.10 per share) if such deadline is extended once, or an aggregate of $2,530,000 ($0.10 per share) if such deadline is extended twice, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. Public stockholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their public shares in connection with any such extension. In the event that our insiders elect to extend the time to complete a business combination and deposit the applicable amount of money into trust, the insiders would receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit, which will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. In the event that we receive notice from our insiders five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our insiders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our insiders, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, such insiders (or their affiliates or designees) may deposit the entire amount required. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors, which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted time period.
The Sponsor, our officers, and our directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, dated as of August 10, 2021 (the “Letter Agreement”), and referenced as Exhibit 10.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination by August 13, 2022 (or November 13, 2022 or February 13, 2023, as applicable, if the time period is extended). However, if the Sponsor, our officers or our directors acquired public shares during or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted time period.

19



The Sponsor, our officers, and our directors have agreed, pursuant to the Letter Agreement, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 13, 2022 (or November 13, 2022 or February 13, 2023, as applicable, if the time period is extended) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may only redeem our public shares so long as our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time.
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any redemptions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a redemption is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. It is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible after August 13, 2022 (or November 13, 2022 or February 13, 2023, as applicable, if the time period is extended), but not more than five business days thereafter, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the above procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to seeking to complete an initial business combination, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
We will seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage) and any prospective target businesses enter into valid and enforceable agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. The underwriters in the Initial Public Offering executed such a waiver agreement.

20



As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. In the event that a potential contracted party was to refuse to execute such a waiver, we will execute an agreement with that entity only if our management first determines that we would be unable to obtain, on a reasonable basis, substantially similar services or opportunities from another entity willing to execute such a waiver. Examples of instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver would be the engagement of a third-party consultant who cannot sign such an agreement due to regulatory restrictions, such as our independent public registered accounting firm, who are unable to sign due to independence requirements, or whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or a situation in which management does not believe it would be able to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. There is also no guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Our insiders have agreed that they will be jointly and severally liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below $10.15 per public share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a valid and enforceable agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Our board of directors has evaluated our insiders’ financial net worth and believes they will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that may arise. However, our insiders may not be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations, as we have not required our insiders to retain any assets to provide for their indemnification obligations, nor have we taken any further steps to ensure that they will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Moreover, our insiders will not be liable to our public stockholders and instead will only have liability to us. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than approximately $10.15 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate sum equal to the amount then held in the trust account, inclusive of any interest not previously released to us, (subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors as described below).
If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination and are forced to redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than five business days to effectuate the redemption of our public shares. Our insiders have waived their rights to participate in any redemption with respect to their shares of common stock. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, our insiders have agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. Each holder of public shares will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.
Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete our initial business combination in the required time period or if the public stockholders seek to have us redeem their respective public shares of common stock upon a business combination, which is actually completed by us. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per-share redemption or redemption amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.15.

21



If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons.
Comparison of Redemption or Purchase Prices in Connection with Our Initial Business Combination and if We Fail to Complete Our Initial Business Combination
The following table compares the redemptions and other permitted purchases of public shares that may take place in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and if we are unable to complete our initial business combination by August 13, 2022 (or November 13, 2022 or February 13, 2023, as applicable, if the time period is extended).

There is no limit to the prices that the Sponsor, our directors, our officers, our advisors or their respective affiliates may pay in these transactions. | ​ | If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by August 13, 2022 (or November 13, 2022 or February 13, 2023, as applicable, if the time period is extended), we will redeem all public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount, then on deposit in the trust account (which was initially $10.15 per public share) including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares.

Impact to remaining stockholders | ​ | The redemptions in connection with our initial business combination will reduce the book value per share for our remaining stockholders, who will bear the burden of the fee payable to Chardan pursuant to the BCMA and interest withdrawn to pay taxes (to the extent not paid from amounts accrued as interest on the funds held in the trust account). | ​ | If the permitted purchases described above are made, there would be no impact to our remaining stockholders because the purchase price would not be paid by us. | ​ | The redemption of our public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination will reduce the book value per share for the shares held by our initial stockholders, who will be our only remaining stockholders after such redemptions.

Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than our Company. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Employees
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process in which we are. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
Our units, shares of common stock, and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. You can read our SEC filings over the internet at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. The financial information included in the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials may be required to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
