Competitive Strengths
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
Organizational structure that enhances client service. We operate our business using a flat vertical structure organized by service offerings rather than a matrix structure organized by geography, which is common among our competitors. Our structure ensures that clients have access to the entire platform of services we offer and the most highly qualified professionals within those service verticals, regardless of the location of the project. Our most skilled engineers and professionals in each service sector work directly with the clients requesting those services, which facilitates relationship-based interactions between our key employees and our clients and promotes long-term client relationships. In addition, our vertical structure encourages entrepreneurialism among our professionals.
Expertise in local markets. To support our vertical service model, we maintain over 112 locations in the United States and abroad. Each of our offices is staffed with licensed or certified professionals who understand the local and regional markets in which they serve. Our local professionals focus on client engagement within their local market while benefiting from the back-office support functions of our shared services platform.
Synergy among our service verticals. We create value for our clients and our shareholders by encouraging our professionals in different service verticals to work together to pursue new work, new clients, and to expand the range of services we can provide our existing clients. Our commitment to cross-selling minimizes our use of sub-consultants to meet our clients’ needs and helps maximize organic growth.
Strong, long-term client relationships. By combining local market experience and providing our clients expert services in multiple verticals, we have developed strong relationships with our core clients. Some of our professionals have worked with key clients for decades, including government transportation agencies, public utilities and local or state municipalities. By serving as a long-term partner with our clients, we gain a deeper understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their projects.

Growth Strategies
We intend to pursue the following growth strategies as we seek to expand our market share and position ourselves as a preferred, single-source provider of professional, engineering and technical consulting services to our clients:
Seek strategic acquisitions to enhance or expand our services offerings. We seek acquisitions that allow us to expand or enhance our capabilities in existing service offerings, supplement existing service offerings with new, closely related service offerings, and expand the geographic footprint of our operations. In the analysis of new acquisitions, we pursue opportunities that provide the critical mass necessary to function as a profitable operation, that complement existing operations, and that have a strong potential for organic growth. We believe that expanding our business through strategic acquisitions will give us economies of scale in the areas of finance, human resources, marketing, administration, information technology, and legal, while also providing cross-selling opportunities among our service offerings. For information on our recent acquisitions, please refer to the “Recent Acquisitions” section included under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Continue to focus on public sector clients while building private sector client capabilities. We have historically derived the majority of our revenue from public and quasi-public sector clients. For the fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, approximately 65%, 68%, and 68%, respectively, of our gross revenues was attributable to public and quasi-public sector clients. During unsteady economic periods, we have focused on public sector business opportunities resulting from public agency outsourcing. We are also positioned to address the challenges presented by the aging infrastructure system of the U.S., 
and the need to provide solutions for transportation, energy, water, and wastewater requirements. However, we also seek to obtain additional clients in the private sector, which typically experiences greater growth during times of economic expansion, by networking, participating in certain organizations, and monitoring private project databases. We will continue to pursue private sector clients when such opportunities present themselves. We believe our ability to service the needs of both public and private sector clients gives us the flexibility to seek and obtain engagements regardless of the current economic conditions.
Strengthen and support our human capital. Our experienced employees and management team are our most valuable resources. Attracting, training, and retaining key personnel has been and will remain critical to our success. To achieve our human capital goals, we intend to remain focused on providing our personnel with entrepreneurial opportunities to expand our business within their areas of expertise. Our leaders, managers, and employees are provided an opportunity to participate in our restricted stock plans. We believe stock ownership promotes a performance-driven, long-term focus that aligns employees' interests with the interests of other NV5 shareholders. We will continue to provide our personnel with personal and professional growth opportunities, including additional training, performance-based incentives such as opportunities for stock ownership, and other competitive benefits.
Reportable Segments
Historically, the Company operations were organized into two reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), re-evaluated the structure of our internal organization as a result of the 2019 acquisition of Geospatial Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Quantum Spatial, Inc. (collectively "QSI"), which resulted in certain changes to our operating and reportable segments. Effective the beginning of fiscal year 2020, our geospatial solution practices were moved from the Company's INF reportable segment to the Company's new GEO reportable segment. To reflect management's revised perspective, the Company is now organized into the following three operating and reportable segments: 
Infrastructure includes our engineering, civil program management, utility services, and construction quality assurance, testing and inspection practices. 
Building, Technology & Sciences includes our environmental health sciences, buildings and program management, and MEP & technology engineering practices.
Geospatial Solutions includes our geospatial solution practices. 
The GEO segment has been created to provide greater visibility regarding the operational and financial performance of the Geospatial business given the recent acquisition of QSI. The GEO segment is consistent with how the Company plans and allocates resources, manages its business, and assesses its performance.

We provide testing, inspection, and consulting services with respect to diverse projects including professional sports stadiums, military facilities, cultural and performing arts centers, airports, hotels, hospitals and health care facilities, fire stations, major public and private universities, and K-12 school districts. We offer these services on an “a la carte” or integrated start-to-finish basis that is intended to guide a client through each phase of a construction project. Our testing, inspection and consulting services generally include site inspections, audits, and evaluations of materials and workmanship necessary to determine and document the quality of the constructed facility. Before a project commences, we offer our clients a variety of assessment services, including environmental, geotechnical, and structural suitability. We perform these pre-construction evaluations in order to help detect any potential problems with the proposed site that could prevent or complicate the successful completion of the project. In addition, we evaluate the onsite building conditions and recommend the best methods and materials for site preparation, excavation, and building foundations.
During development, we help our clients design a comprehensive construction plan, including a summary of planned construction activities, sequence, critical path elements, interrelationships, durations, and terminations. Construction planning services may also include developing procedures for project management, the change order process, and technical records handling methodology. We offer inspection services for each phase of a project, including excavation, foundations, structural framing, mechanical heating and air conditioning systems, electrical systems, underground utilities, and building water proofing systems. Where applicable, we employ additional methods to test materials and building quality. We maintain contact with our clients’ managers and, as issues are detected or anticipated, help them identify the most appropriate, cost-effective solutions. We periodically provide construction progress inspections and assessment reports. When a project is complete, we prepare an evaluation report of the project and certify the inspections for the client. After construction, we offer periodic building 
inspection services to ensure that the building is maintained in accordance with applicable building codes and other local ordinances to maximize the life of the project. We also offer indoor environmental quality testing during this period.
Our services include:
Construction materials testing and engineering services. We provide materials testing services related to concrete, steel, and other structural materials used in construction. We are equipped to provide these services in fabrication plants, in our laboratories, and at the project or construction site itself. Our field personnel work directly under the supervision of licensed engineers and maintain individual licenses and certifications in their respective areas of expertise. All our in-house laboratories are inspected routinely by agencies including or similar to the Cement and Concrete Reference Laboratory (“CCRL”) of the National Institute of Standards and Measures. In addition, our laboratories participate in proficiency programs conducted by the CCRL and the American Association of State Highway & Transportation Officials.
Geotechnical engineering and consulting services. We provide a wide variety of geotechnical engineering and consulting services. These services allow our clients to determine whether sites are suitable for proposed projects and to design foundation plans that are compatible with project site and use conditions. We have experienced geotechnical engineers, geologists, and earth scientists who provide these services nationwide.

In the event of damage to a structure by natural or man-made causes, our professional staff is qualified to provide forensic consulting and analysis as well as expert witness services. We provide a wide variety of forensic consulting services, including studies related to water intrusion, building code compliance, and claims involving insurance.
Civil Program Management
Civil program management provides for transportation and water construction projects, including construction management. Our services consist of providing a wide variety of governmental outsourcing services and consulting services that assist organizations with compliance related to technical government regulations and industry standards. We offer a broad array of technical outsourcing services, including traffic studies. Our program management services are not at-risk services; they are performed under a unit price fee arrangement, which is not outcome-based.
Program management also includes project administration, including bid and award assessment, monitoring services for active projects, scheduling assistance, drawing review, permit, approval and review processing, contractor, designer and agency coordination, cost control management, progress payment management, change order administration, compliance inspections, constructability review, as needed, and evaluation of cost reduction methods.
The trend towards increased privatization of U.S. Federal, state, and local governmental services presents an opportunity for our program management vertical. Faced with increased budgetary constraints and economic challenges, many governmental agencies now seek to outsource various services, including professional guidance for their building departments. For building departments specifically, we typically provide a turnkey solution in exchange for a percentage of the building permit fees collected or a minimum monthly retainer. The governmental agency retains any overage without any overhead costs associated with the fee charged. Outsourcing provides a positive source of revenue for us, while simultaneously increasing the efficiency and quality of service to the public. The governmental agency also gains flexible control of service levels without the challenges of government bureaucracy. Although we plan to grow our program management services organically through the numerous contacts and client relationships we have with U.S. Federal, state and local governments, tribal nations, and educational institutions, we are also actively targeting acquisition opportunities that provide program management services.

Audiovisual – Security and Surveillance – IT – Data Center. We provide needs assessments, infrastructure design, systems design, construction monitoring, and acceptance testing.
Environmental Services
The environmental services we offer include occupational health, safety, and environmental consulting and testing as well as environmental transactional services. More specifically, our experts investigate and analyze environmental conditions both outside and inside a building, and recommend corrective measures and procedures needed to comply with workplace occupational health and safety programs. Our occupational health and safety services include workplace safety audits, ergonomics studies, emergency preparedness plans and response services, and workplace monitoring in regulated industries. We also specialize in the provision of radiation exposure and protection services, as well as nuclear safety and industrial hygiene analyses. We have actively expanded NV5's nationwide capabilities in recent years to support our clients' environmental and sustainability initiatives, including sustainable infrastructure, clean energy, energy efficiency, environmental compliance, and water and natural resource management. 
Additional environmental services include hydrogeological modeling and environmental programs that assist our public agencies and private industry clients in compliance with U.S. Federal, state, and local requirements for groundwater resource assessments, water resource planning, monitoring and environmental management of wastewater facilities, solid waste landfill investigations, permitting and compliance, storm water pollution, environmental impact statement support, agricultural waste management and permitting, and wetland evaluations.
Geospatial Solutions
Our geospatial solutions include a full spectrum of geospatial data analytic capabilities that leverage leading-edge remote sensing technology and proprietary solutions. More specifically, our proprietary and analytic solutions include autonomous solutions, subscription software, automated enrichment, proprietary algorithms, and cloud-based data engagement. We provide remote sensing and data analytics to enable asset management, reliability and maintainability of assets, safety, and predictive modeling. To take advantage of this growth market, during fiscal year 2019 we acquired QSI, a provider of geospatial solutions for government and commercial applications and in fiscal 2021 we acquired Geodynamics expanding our deep-water geospatial capabilities. Geodynamics sonar-based geospatial capabilities, coupled with our existing nearshore and shallow-water riverine geospatial offerings, expands our marine solutions strategy and provides us with a competitive advantage for multi-solution, hydrographic survey projects.
Our geospatial services assist utilities in vegetation management of assets (i.e., overhead power transmission and distribution lines). This entails providing data used by utilities to monitor and control vegetation growth potential close to their assets for regulatory compliance requirements which enhance visibility and long-term stability. The trend towards use of remote sensing and analytics by utilities is rapidly replacing 'boots on the ground' inspection with more reliable and accurate monitoring. 
In addition, our geospatial mapping services includes topobathymetric nearshore analytics in analyzing nearshore underwater terrain (too shallow for sonar and not visible with topographic LiDAR). This service provides government agencies with data used in coastal management, floodplain analysis, environmental ecology, and hydrological resource management. We believe that climate change, extreme weather incidents, and water conservation efforts combine to make the data and services we provide invaluable to agencies that utilize these data sets produced by our geospatial mapping services. The addition of Geodynamics gives us an established presence in the oceanic geospatial sector to support projects related to offshore wind power, sea level rise, shoreline mapping, underwater habitat modeling, and nautical charting.
Strategic Acquisitions
We maintain a full-time merger and acquisitions (“M&A”) initiative with executive personnel specifically dedicated to the identification of acquisition targets, exploration of acquisition opportunities, negotiation of terms, and oversight of the acquisition and post-acquisition integration process. Our M&A team has established extensive relationships throughout the industry and continues to maintain an established pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities.
We primarily seek acquisitions that allow us to expand or enhance our capabilities in our existing service offerings, to supplement our existing service offerings with new, closely related service offerings, or expand our service area geographically. We pursue opportunities that provide the platform to function as a profitable stand-alone operation and are profitable with strong potential for organic growth. Acquisition targets must have an experienced management team that is compatible with our culture and thoroughly committed to our strategic direction. We believe we add value to the operations of our acquisitions by providing superior corporate marketing and sales support, cash management, financial controls, information technology, risk management and human resources support through a performance optimization process. Our performance optimization process, which was developed by our executives through their extensive experience acquiring and integrating companies, entails a review of both back office and operational functions to, among other things, identify how to improve:
•Inefficiencies related to the delivery of our services to customers,
•Performance of a new acquisition through the integration of personnel into our organization,
•Risk management of a new acquisition,
•Integration of technology and shared services platforms, and
•Cross-selling opportunities to create synergies within our service offerings.
For more information on our recent acquisitions, refer to the “Recent Acquisitions” section included under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 6, Business Acquisitions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Key Clients and Projects
We currently serve approximately 11,115 clients. Our ten largest clients accounted for approximately 28% of our gross revenues during the year ended January 1, 2022. No individual client represented more than 10% of our gross revenues during the years 2021, 2020 or 2019. Although we serve a highly diverse client base, during the years 2021, 2020, and 2019 
approximately 65%, 68% and 68%, respectively, of our gross revenues was attributable to public and quasi-public sector clients.
Public sector clients include:
•U.S. Federal, state, and local government departments, agencies, systems, and authorities
•Transportation agencies

Of our private sector clients, our largest clients are construction engineering firms and institutional property owners.
Although we anticipate public and quasi-public sector clients will represent the majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future, we intend to continue expanding our service offerings to private sector clients. Historically, public and quasi-public sector clients have demonstrated greater resilience during periods of economic downturns, while private sector clients have offered higher gross profit margin opportunities during periods of economic expansion.
Marketing and Sales
We strive to position ourselves as a preferred, single-source provider of professional and technical consulting and certification services to our clients. We obtain client engagements primarily through business development efforts, cross-selling our services to existing clients, and maintaining client relationships, as well as referrals from existing and former clients.
Our business development efforts emphasize lead generation, industry group networking, and corporate visibility. Most of our business development efforts are led by members of our engineering and other professional teams who are also responsible for managing projects. Our business development efforts are further supported by our shared services marketing group, which consists of a seasoned marketing team and marketing support personnel located at our corporate headquarters and operating units.
As our service offerings continue expanding, we anticipate increasing our cross-selling opportunities. Currently, we are often able to offer our testing, inspection and consulting services to clients in conjunction with our infrastructure, engineering, and support services. Another significant area of cross-selling has been our ability to leverage our electrical and gas design services throughout our national geographic network of offices by introducing our services to new utility service organizations.
We have observed a trend in the engineering and consulting industry which has shifted client relationships away from project-specific engagements and toward long-term, multi-project relationships. This shift requires that service providers commit considerable resources toward maintaining client relationships, including dedicating both technical and marketing resources tailored to the specific client’s needs. We are committed to maintaining our client relationships by remaining responsive to our clients’ needs and continuing to offer a broad range of quality service offerings and value-added solutions.
Human Capital Resources
Our experienced employees and management team are our most valuable resources and we are committed to attracting, motivating, and retaining top professionals to service our clients. As of January 1, 2022, we had 3,428 employees, including 3,139 full-time employees, which includes 814 licensed engineers and other professionals. To date, we have been able to locate and engage highly qualified employees as needed and do not currently expect our growth efforts to be constrained by a lack of qualified personnel. We consider our employee relations to be good. 
Our success is directly related to the satisfaction, growth, and development of our employees. We strive to offer a work environment where employee unique characteristics and opinions are valued and one that provides our employees the 
opportunities to use and augment their professional skills. To achieve our human capital goals, we intend to remain focused on providing our personnel with entrepreneurial opportunities to expand our business within their areas of expertise and continue to provide our personnel with personal and professional growth. In addition to salaries, we also provide a 401(k)-retirement plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings accounts, paid time off, and various services and tools to support our employees' health and wellness. Our leaders, managers, and employers are provided an opportunity to participate in our restricted stock plans. We emphasize a number of measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, including, among others, employee safety and wellness, talent acquisition and retention, employee engagement, development, and training, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity. 
We believe in supporting our employees’ health and well-being. Our goal is to assist employees in making informed decisions about their health by providing the tools and resources necessary to succeed in a healthier lifestyle. Our wellness program incorporates wellness activities, such as an annual physical, additional fitness activities, coaching and wellness challenges to support those lifestyle goals. The program is rewards based and employees are offered specific incentives for participation. 
COVID-19 and Employee Safety and Wellness. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the safety and well-being of our employees and their families has been a top priority as we continue to serve our customers. Our global pandemic efforts include leveraging the advice and recommendations of infectious disease experts and organizations to establish appropriate safety standards and secure appropriate levels of personal protective equipment for our workforce. Based upon this advice and recommendations, we have adopted and implemented the NV5 COVID-19 Exposure Risk Response Policy ("NV5 COVID Response Plan") to outline the Company's policies and procedures designed to mitigate the potential for transmission of COVID-19 and prevent exposure to illness from certain other infectious disease. Among other things, the NV5 COVID Response Plan memorializes employee, manager, and company responsibilities related to house-keeping and sanitization, hygiene and respiratory etiquette, use of personal protective equipment, employee and visitor screening procedures, leave policies and accommodations, remote working opportunities and infrastructure, and protocols for not reporting to work and/or when to return to work upon potential and/or confirmed COVID-19 exposure or infection. 
Employee Engagement, Development, and Training. We provide all employees with the opportunity to share their opinions and feedback on our culture which helps enhance the employee experience, promote employee retention, drive change, and leverage the overall success of our organization. We provide all employees a wide range of professional development experiences, both formal and informal, at all stages in their careers. 
Diversity and Inclusion and Ethical Business Practices. We are committed to fostering work environments that value and promote diversity and inclusion, including NV5's Diversity and Inclusion Program which focuses on initiatives to increase the diversity of our workforce and promote an environment of trust where employees feel safe to express their opinions and perspectives without fear of repercussion. This commitment includes providing equal access to, and participation in, equal employment opportunities, programs, and services without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, stereotypes or assumptions based thereon. We pride ourselves in the development and fair treatment of our global workforce, including generous healthcare and benefit programs for our employees, equal employment hiring practices and policies, anti-harassment, workforce safety, and anti-retaliation policies. We welcome and celebrate our teams’ differences, experiences, and beliefs, and we are investing in a more engaged, diverse, and inclusive workforce.
NV5 fosters a strong corporate culture that promotes high standards of ethics and compliance for our businesses, including policies that set forth principles to guide employee, officer, director, and vendor conduct, such as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We maintain a whistleblower policy and anonymous hotline for the confidential reporting of any suspected policy violations or unethical business conduct on the part of our businesses, employees, officers, directors, or vendors and provide training and education to our global workforce with respect to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies. 
Competition
The engineering and consulting industry is highly fragmented and characterized by many small-scale companies that focus their operations on regional markets or specialized niche activities. As a result, we compete with a large number of regional, national, and global companies. The extent of our competition varies according to the particular markets and geographic area. The level and type of competition we face is also influenced by the nature and scope of a particular project.
Providers of engineering and consulting services primarily compete based on quality of service, relevant experience, staffing capabilities, reputation, geographic presence, stability, and price. Price differentiation remains an important element in competitive tendering and is the most significant factor in bidding for public sector consultancy contracts. The importance of 
the foregoing factors varies widely based upon the nature, location, and size of the project. We believe that certain economies of scale can be realized by service providers that establish a national reputation for providing engineering and consulting services in all six of the service verticals in which we do business. Since the demand for engineering and consulting services within each service offering is viewed as only moderately correlated with the demand for services within the other service offerings, we perceive that engineering and consulting firms can benefit considerably from diversified service offerings.
The number of competitors for any procurement can vary widely, depending upon technical qualifications, the relative value of the project, geographic location, financial terms, risks associated with the work, and any restrictions placed upon competition by the client. Our ability to compete successfully will depend upon the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, the strength of our client relationships, our ability to accurately estimate costs, the quality of the work we perform, our ability to hire and train qualified personnel, and our ability to obtain insurance.
We believe our principal publicly listed and private company competitors include the following firms (in alphabetical order): AECOM Technology Corporation (NYSE: ACM), AMEC plc (LSE: AMEC), Bureau Veritas (PAR: BVI), Hill International, Inc. (NYSE: HIL), Intertek Group plc (LSE:ITRK), Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE: J), Stantec Inc. (TSE: STN), Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK), Willdan Group (NASDAQ: WLDN), Leidos (NYSE: LDOS), Dewberry, POWER Engineers, Burns & McDonnell, and TRC Companies, Inc. 
Seasonality 
Historically, our operating results in the months of November through March have generally been weaker compared to our operating results in other months primarily due to adverse weather conditions and the holiday season. As a result, our gross revenues and net income for the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year may be lower when compared to our results for the second and third quarters of our fiscal year.
Insurance and Risk Management
We maintain insurance covering professional liability and claims involving bodily injury, property and economic loss. We consider our present limits of coverage, deductibles, and reserves to be adequate. Whenever possible, we endeavor to eliminate or reduce the risk of loss on a project using quality assurance and control, risk management, workplace safety, and other similar methods.
Risk management is an integral part of our project management approach for lump-sum contracts and our project execution process. We have a risk management process group that reviews and oversees the risk profile of our operations. We also evaluate risk through internal risk analyses in which our management reviews higher-risk projects, contracts, or other business decisions that require corporate legal and risk management approval.
Regulation
We are regulated in a number of fields in which we operate. We contract with various U.S. governmental agencies and entities. When working with U.S. governmental agencies and entities, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts. These laws and regulations contain terms that, among other things:
•require certification and disclosure of all costs or pricing data in connection with various contract negotiations,
•impose procurement regulations that define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various cost-based U.S. government contracts, and
•restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.
We are also subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. 
Internationally, we are subject to various government laws and regulations (including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations), local government regulations, procurement policies and practices, and varying currency, political, and economic risks.
To help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees are sometimes required to complete tailored ethics and other compliance training relevant to their position and our operations.
