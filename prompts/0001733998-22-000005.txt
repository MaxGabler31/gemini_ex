ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
NW Holdings is a holding company headquartered in Portland, Oregon and owns NW Natural, NW Natural Water Company, LLC (NWN Water), NW Natural Renewables Holdings, LLC, a non-regulated subsidiary established to pursue non-regulated renewable natural gas activities, and other businesses and activities. NW Natural is NW Holdings’ largest subsidiary. NW Natural owns NW Natural RNG Holding Company, LLC, a holding company established to invest in the development and procurement of regulated renewable natural gas for NW Natural.
NW Natural distributes natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers in Oregon and southwest Washington. NW Natural and its predecessors have supplied gas service to the public since 1859, was incorporated in Oregon in 1910, and began doing business as NW Natural in 1997. NW Natural's natural gas distribution activities are reported in the natural gas distribution (NGD) segment. All other business activities, including certain gas storage activities, water businesses, non-regulated renewable natural gas activities and other investments and activities are aggregated and reported as "other" at their respective registrant.
NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION (NGD) SEGMENT
Both NW Holdings and NW Natural have one reportable segment, the NGD segment, which is operated by NW Natural. NGD provides natural gas service through approximately 786,000 meters in Oregon and southwest Washington. Approximately 88% of customers are located in Oregon and 12% are located in southwest Washington. 
NW Natural has been allocated an exclusive service territory by the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) and Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC), which includes the major population centers in western Oregon, including the Portland metropolitan area, most of the Willamette Valley, the Coastal area from Astoria to Coos Bay, and portions of Washington along the Columbia River. Major businesses located in NW Natural's service territory include retail, manufacturing, and high-technology industries. 
Customers
The NGD business serves residential, commercial, and industrial customers with no individual customer accounting for more than 10% of NW Natural's or NW Holdings' revenues. On an annual basis, residential and commercial customers typically account for approximately 60% of NGD volumes delivered and approximately 90% of NGD margin. Industrial and other customers largely account for the remaining volumes and margin. 
The following table presents summary meter information for the NGD segment as of December 31, 2021:

 | Number of Meters | % of Volumes | | % of Margin
Residential | 715,958 | | 38 | % | | 65 | %
Commercial | 68,961 | | 21 | % | | 24 | %
Industrial | 978 | | 41 | % | | 7 | %
Other(1) | N/A | N/A | | 4 | %
Total | 785,897 | | 100 | % | | 100 | %

(1) NGD margin is also affected by other items, including miscellaneous revenues, gains or losses from NW Natural's gas cost incentive sharing mechanism, other margin adjustments, and other regulated services. 
Generally, residential and commercial customers purchase both their natural gas commodity (gas sales) and natural gas delivery services (transportation services) from the NGD business. Industrial customers also purchase transportation services, but may buy the gas commodity either from NW Natural or directly from a third-party gas marketer or supplier. Gas commodity cost is primarily a pass-through cost to customers; therefore, profit margins are not materially affected by an industrial customer's decision to purchase gas from NW Natural or from third parties. Industrial and large commercial customers may also select between firm and interruptible service levels, with firm services generally providing higher profit margins compared to interruptible services.
To help manage gas supplies, industrial tariffs are designed to provide some certainty regarding industrial customers' volumes by requiring an annual service election, special rates or possible restrictions for changes between elections, and in some cases, a minimum or maximum volume requirement before changing options. 
Customer growth rates for natural gas utilities in the Pacific Northwest historically have been among the highest in the nation due to lower market saturation as natural gas became widely available as a residential heating source after other fuel options. We estimate natural gas was in approximately 63% of single-family residential homes in NW Natural's service territory in 2021. Customer growth in our region comes mainly from the following sources: single-family housing, both new construction and conversions; multifamily housing new construction; and commercial buildings, both new construction and conversions. Single-family new construction has consistently been our largest source of growth. Continued customer growth is closely tied to the comparative price of natural gas to electricity and fuel oil and the economic health of Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington. We believe there is potential for continued growth as natural gas is a preferred direct energy source due to its affordability, reliability, comfort, and convenience. 
Competitive Conditions
In its service areas, the NGD business has no direct competition from other natural gas distributors. However, it competes with other forms of energy in each customer class. This competition among energy suppliers is based on price, efficiency, reliability, performance, preference, market conditions, technology, federal, state, and local energy policy, and environmental impacts. 
For residential and small to mid-size commercial customers, the NGD business competes primarily with providers of electricity, fuel oil, and propane.
In the industrial and large commercial markets, the NGD business competes with all forms of energy, including competition from wholesale natural gas marketers. In addition, large industrial customers could bypass NW Natural's natural gas distribution system by installing their own direct pipeline connection to the interstate pipeline system. NW Natural has designed custom transportation service agreements with several large industrial customers to provide transportation service rates that are competitive with the customer’s costs of installing their own pipeline.
Seasonality of Business
The NGD business is seasonal in nature due to higher gas usage by residential and commercial customers during the cold winter heating months. Other categories of customers experience similar seasonality in their usage but to a lesser extent.
Regulation and Rates
The NGD business is subject to regulation by the OPUC and WUTC. These regulatory agencies authorize rates and allow recovery mechanisms to provide the opportunity to recover prudently incurred capital and operating costs from customers, while also earning a reasonable return on investment for investors. In addition, the OPUC and WUTC also regulate the system of accounts and issuance of securities by NW Natural.
NW Natural files general rate cases and rate tariff requests periodically with the OPUC and WUTC to establish approved rates, an authorized return on equity (ROE), an overall rate of return (ROR) on rate base, an authorized capital structure, and other revenue/cost deferral and recovery mechanisms. 
NW Natural is also regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Under NW Natural's Mist interstate storage certificate with FERC, NW Natural is required to file either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue study every five years to change or justify maintaining the existing rates for the interstate storage service. 
For further discussion on our most recent general rate cases, see Part II, Item 7, "Results of Operations—Regulatory Matters—Regulation and Rates."
Gas Supply
NW Natural strives to secure sufficient, reliable supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost, while maintaining price stability, managing gas purchase costs prudently and supporting our core value of environmental stewardship. This is accomplished through a comprehensive strategy focused on the following items:
•Reliability - ensuring gas resource portfolios are sufficient to satisfy customer requirements under extreme cold weather conditions;
•Diverse Supply - providing diversity of supply sources;
•Diverse Contracts - maintaining a variety of contract durations, types, and counterparties; 
•Cost Management and Recovery - employing prudent gas cost management strategies; and
•Environmental Stewardship - striving to reduce the carbon content and environmental impacts of the energy we deliver.
Reliability
The effectiveness of the natural gas distribution system ultimately rests on whether reliable service is provided to NGD customers. To ensure effectiveness, the NGD business has developed a risk-based methodology in which it uses a planning standard to serve the highest firm sales demand day in any year with 99% certainty. 
The projected maximum design day firm NGD customer sales is approximately 10 million therms. Of this total, the NGD business is currently capable of meeting about 55% of requirements with gas from storage located within or adjacent to its service territory, while the remaining supply requirements would come from gas purchases under firm gas purchase contracts and recall agreements. 
NW Natural segments transportation capacity, which is a natural gas transportation mechanism under which a shipper can leverage its firm pipeline transportation capacity by separating it into multiple segments with alternate delivery routes. The reliability of service on these alternate routes will vary depending on the constraints of the pipeline system. For those segments with acceptable reliability, segmentation provides a shipper with increased flexibility and potential cost savings compared to traditional pipeline service. The NGD business relies on segmentation of firm pipeline transportation capacity that flows from Stanfield, Oregon to various points south of Molalla, Oregon. 
We believe gas supplies would be sufficient to meet existing NGD firm customer demand in the event of maximum design day weather conditions. 
The following table shows the sources of supply projected to be used to satisfy the design day sales for the 2021-22 winter heating season:

Therms in millions | Therms | Percent
Sources of NGD supply: | | 
Firm supply purchases | 3.4 | | 34 | %
Mist underground storage (NGD only) | 3.1 | | 31 | %
Company-owned LNG storage | 1.9 | | 19 | %
Off-system storage contract | 0.5 | | 5 | %
Pipeline segmentation capacity | 0.6 | | 6 | %
Recall agreements | 0.4 | | 4 | %
Peak day citygate deliveries | 0.1 | | 1 | %
Total | 10.0 | | 100 | %

The OPUC and WUTC have Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) processes in which utilities define different growth scenarios and corresponding resource and compliance strategies in an effort to evaluate supply and demand resource and compliance requirements, consider uncertainties in the planning process and the need for flexibility to respond to changes, and establish a plan for providing reliable service at the least cost.
NW Natural generally files a full IRP biennially for Oregon and Washington with the OPUC and the WUTC, respectively, and files updates between filings. The OPUC acknowledges NW Natural's action plan, whereas the WUTC provides notice that the IRP has met the requirements of the Washington Administrative Code. OPUC acknowledgment of the IRP does not constitute ratemaking approval of any specific resource acquisition strategy or expenditure. For additional information see Part II, Item 7, "Results of Operations—Regulatory Matters."
Diversity of Supply Sources
NW Natural purchases gas supplies primarily from the Alberta and British Columbia provinces of Canada and multiple receipt points in the U.S. Rocky Mountains to protect against regional supply disruptions and to take advantage of price differentials. For 2021, 62% of gas supply came from Canada, with the balance primarily coming from the U.S. Rocky Mountain region. The extraction of shale gas has increased the availability of gas supplies throughout North America. We believe gas supplies available in the western United States and Canada are adequate to serve NGD customer requirements for the foreseeable future. NW Natural continues to evaluate the long-term supply mix based on projections of gas production and pricing in the U.S. Rocky Mountain region as well as other regions in North America.
NW Natural supplements firm gas supply purchases with gas withdrawals from gas storage facilities, including underground reservoirs and LNG storage facilities. Storage facilities are generally injected with natural gas during the off-peak months in the spring and summer, and the gas is withdrawn for use during peak demand months in the winter. 
The following table presents the storage facilities available for NGD business supply: 

 | Maximum Daily Deliverability (therms in millions) | Designed StorageCapacity (Bcf)
Gas Storage Facilities | | 
Owned Facility | | 
Mist, Oregon (Mist Facility)(1) | 3.1 | | 11.3
Mist, Oregon (North Mist Facility)(2) | 1.3 | | 4.1 
Contracted Facility | | 
Jackson Prairie, Washington(3) | 0.5 | | 1.1 
LNG Facilities | | 
Owned Facilities | | 
Newport, Oregon | 0.6 | | 1.0 
Portland, Oregon | 1.3 | | 0.6 
Total | 6.8 | | 18.1

(1) The Mist gas storage facility has a total maximum daily deliverability of 5.7 million therms and a total designed storage capacity of about 17.0 Bcf, of which 3.1 million therms of daily deliverability and 11.3 Bcf of storage capacity are reserved for NGD business customers. 
(2) The North Mist facility is contracted to exclusively serve Portland General Electric, a local electric utility, and may not be used to serve other NGD customers. See "North Mist Gas Storage Facility" below for more information.
(3) The storage facility is located near Chehalis, Washington and is contracted from Northwest Pipeline, a subsidiary of The Williams Companies.
The Mist facility serves NGD segment customers and is also used for non-NGD purposes, primarily for contracts with gas storage customers, including utilities and third-party marketers. Under regulatory agreements with the OPUC and WUTC, gas storage at Mist can be developed in advance of NGD customer needs but is subject to recall when needed to serve such customers as their demand increases. When storage capacity is recalled for NGD purposes it becomes part of the NGD segment. In 2021, the NGD business did not recall additional deliverability or associated storage capacity to serve customer needs. The North Mist facility is contracted for the exclusive use of Portland General Electric, a local electric utility, and may not be used to serve other NGD customers. See "North Mist Gas Storage Facility" below.
Diverse Contract Durations and Types
NW Natural has a diverse portfolio of short-, medium-, and long-term firm gas supply contracts and a variety of contract types including firm and interruptible supplies as well as supplemental supplies from gas storage facilities. 
The portfolio of firm gas supply contracts typically includes the following gas purchase contracts: year-round and winter-only baseload supplies; seasonal supply with an option to call on additional daily supplies during the winter heating season; and daily or monthly spot purchases.
During 2021, a total of 807 million therms were purchased under contracts with durations as follows:

Contract Duration (primary term) | Percent of Purchases
Long-term (one year or longer) | 39 | %
Short-term (more than one month, less than one year) | 24 | 
Spot (one month or less) | 37 | 
Total | 100 | %

Gas supply contracts are renewed or replaced as they expire. During 2021, there was one supplier that provided 10% of the NGD business gas supply requirements. No other individual supplier provided 10% or more of the NGD business gas supply requirements.
Gas Cost Management
The cost of gas sold to NGD customers primarily consists of the following items, which are included in annual Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) rates: gas purchases from suppliers; charges from pipeline companies to transport gas to our distribution system; gas storage costs; gas reserves contracts; and gas commodity derivative contracts.
The NGD business employs a number of strategies to mitigate the cost of gas sold to customers. The primary strategies for managing gas commodity price risk include:
•negotiating fixed prices directly with gas suppliers;
•negotiating financial derivative contracts that: (1) effectively convert floating index prices in physical gas supply contracts to fixed prices (referred to as commodity price swaps); or (2) effectively set a ceiling or floor price, or both, on floating index priced physical supply contracts (referred to as commodity price options such as calls, puts, and collars);
•buying physical gas supplies at a set price and injecting the gas into storage for price stability and to minimize pipeline capacity demand costs; and
•investing in gas reserves for longer term price stability. See Note 13 for additional information about our gas reserves.
NW Natural also contracts with an independent energy marketing company to capture opportunities regarding storage and pipeline capacity when those assets are not serving the needs of NGD business customers. Asset management activities provide opportunities for cost of gas savings for customers and incremental revenues for NW Natural through regulatory incentive-sharing mechanisms. These activities, net of the amount shared, are included in other for segment reporting purposes.
Gas Cost Recovery
Mechanisms for gas cost recovery are designed to be fair and reasonable, with an appropriate balance between the interests of customers and NW Natural. In general, natural gas distribution rates are designed to recover the costs of, but not to earn a return on, the gas commodity sold. Risks associated with gas cost recovery are minimized by resetting customer rates annually through the PGA and aligning customer and shareholder interests through the use of sharing, weather normalization, and conservation mechanisms in Oregon. See Part II, Item 7, "Results of Operations—Regulatory Matters" and "Results of Operations—Business Segments—Natural Gas Distribution Operations—Cost of Gas".
Environmental Stewardship
Part of our gas supply strategy is working to reduce the carbon content and the environmental impacts of the energy we deliver. To that end, NW Natural developed and implemented an emissions screening tool that uses Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data to calculate the relative emissions intensity of gas producer operations and prioritize purchases from lower emitting producers. Beginning in 2019, we began using this emissions intensity screening tool alongside other purchasing criteria such as price, credit worthiness and geographic diversity. The result has been a cost-neutral way to reduce carbon emissions associated with our natural gas supply.
NW Natural is focused on taking steps to lower its emissions on behalf of customers by purchasing environmental attributes that are generated by the production of renewable natural gas (RNG). Under Oregon Senate Bill 98, NW Natural can purchase or invest in RNG facilities, which generate these environmental attributes known as Renewable Thermal Certificates (RTCs). The RTCs work like renewable energy certificates, or RECs, used in electricity markets. RTCs are verified and certified by the Midwest Renewable Energy Tracking System (M-RETS). The M-RETS Renewable Thermal Tracking System issues one RTC for every dekatherm of renewable natural gas.
Transportation of Gas Supplies
NW Natural's gas distribution system is reliant on a single, bi-directional interstate transmission pipeline to bring gas supplies into the natural gas distribution system. Although dependent on a single pipeline, the pipeline’s gas flows into the Portland metropolitan market from two directions: (1) the north, which brings supplies from the British Columbia and Alberta supply basins; and (2) the east, which brings supplies from Alberta as well as the U.S. Rocky Mountain supply basins.
NW Natural incurs monthly demand charges related to firm pipeline transportation contracts. These contracts have expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2061. The largest pipeline agreements are with Northwest Pipeline. NW Natural actively works with Northwest Pipeline and others to renew contracts in advance of expiration to ensure gas transportation capacity is sufficient to meet customer needs. 
Rates for interstate pipeline transportation services are established by FERC within the U.S. and by Canadian authorities for services on Canadian pipelines.
Gas Distribution
Safety and the protection of employees, customers, and our communities at large are, and will remain, top priorities. NW Natural constructs, operates, and maintains its pipeline distribution system and storage operations with the goal of ensuring natural gas is delivered and stored safely, reliably, and efficiently. 
NW Natural has one of the most modern distribution systems in the country with no identified cast iron pipe or bare steel main. Since the 1980s, NW Natural has taken a proactive approach to replacement programs and partnered with the OPUC and WUTC on progressive regulation to further safety and reliability efforts for the distribution system. In the past, NW Natural had a cost recovery program in Oregon that encompassed programs for cast iron replacement, bare steel replacement, transmission integrity management, and distribution integrity management programs as appropriate.
Natural gas distribution businesses are likely to be subject to greater federal and state regulation in the future. Additional operating and safety regulations from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) are currently under development. In 2016, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking titled the "Safety of Gas Transmission Pipelines: MAOP Reconfirmation, Expansion of Assessment Requirements, and Other Related Amendments." In 2019, PHMSA issued the first of three portions of the rulemaking which went into effect on July 1, 2020 and includes up to a 15-year timeline for compliance. The gas gathering rule was issued in late 2021 and the leak detection rule is expected to be issued in 2022. NW Natural intends to continue to work diligently with industry associations as well as federal and state regulators to ensure the safety of the system and compliance with new laws and regulations. The costs associated with compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations are expected to be recovered in rates.
North Mist Gas Storage Facility
In May 2019, NW Natural completed an expansion of its existing gas storage facility near Mist, Oregon. The North Mist facility provides long-term, no-notice underground gas storage service and is dedicated solely to Portland General Electric (PGE) under a 30-year contract with options to extend up to an additional 50 years upon mutual agreement of the parties. PGE uses the facility to fuel its gas-fired electric power generation facilities, which backs up PGE's variable load of renewable energy on the electric grid.
North Mist includes a reservoir providing 4.1 Bcf of available storage, an additional compressor station with a contractual capacity of 120,000 dekatherms of gas per day, no-notice service that can be drawn on rapidly, and a 13-mile pipeline to connect to PGE's Port Westward gas plants in Clatskanie, Oregon.
Upon placement into service in May 2019, the facility was included in rate base under an established tariff schedule with revenues recognized consistent with the schedule. Billing rates will be updated annually to the current depreciable asset level and forecasted operating expenses.
While there are additional expansion opportunities in the Mist storage field, any expansion would be based on market demand, cost effectiveness, available financing, receipt of future permits, and other rights.
OTHER
Certain businesses and activities of NW Holdings and NW Natural are aggregated and reported as other for segment reporting purposes.
NW Natural
The following businesses and activities are aggregated and reported as other under NW Natural, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NW Holdings: 
•5.7 Bcf of the Mist gas storage facility contracted to other utilities and third-party marketers;
•natural gas asset management activities; and
•appliance retail center operations.
Mist Gas Storage
The Mist gas storage facility began operations in 1989. It is a 17.0 Bcf facility with 11.3 Bcf used to provide gas storage for the NGD business. The remaining 5.7 Bcf of the facility is contracted with other utilities and third-party marketers with these results reported in other. In 2021, NW Natural began to utilize 1 Bcf of increased storage capacity realized through reservoir expansion during more than 15 years of delta pressure operations. This change increased the working gas capacity from 16 Bcf to 17 Bcf.
The overall facility consists of seven depleted natural gas reservoirs, 22 injection and withdrawal wells, a compressor station, dehydration and control equipment, gathering lines, and other related facilities. The capacity at Mist serving other utilities and third-party marketers provides multi-cycle gas storage services to customers in the interstate and intrastate markets. The interstate storage services are offered under a limited jurisdiction blanket certificate issued by FERC. Under NW Natural's interstate storage certificate with FERC, NW Natural is required to file either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue study every five years to change or justify maintaining the existing rates for the interstate storage service. Intrastate firm storage services in Oregon are offered under an OPUC-approved rate schedule as an optional service to certain eligible customers. Gas storage revenues from the 5.7 Bcf are derived primarily from firm service customers who provide energy-related services, including natural gas distribution, electric generation, and energy marketing. The Mist facility benefits from limited competition as there are few storage facilities in the Pacific Northwest region. Therefore, NW Natural is able to acquire high-value, multi-year contracts.
Asset Management Activities
NW Natural contracts with an independent energy marketing company to provide asset management services, primarily through the use of natural gas commodity exchange agreements and natural gas pipeline capacity release transactions. The results of these activities are included in other, except for the asset management revenues allocated to NGD business customers pursuant to regulatory agreements, which are reported in the NGD segment. 
NW Holdings
These include the following businesses and activities aggregated under NW Holdings:
•NW Natural Water Company, LLC (NWN Water) and its water and wastewater utility operations;
•NW Natural Renewables Holdings, LLC and its non-regulated renewable natural gas activities;
•a minority interest in the Kelso-Beaver Pipeline held by our wholly-owned subsidiary NNG Financial Corporation (NNG Financial); and 
•holding company and corporate activities, including business development activities, as well as adjustments made in consolidation. 
Water Utilities
NWN Water serves a total of approximately 80,000 people through approximately 33,000 water and wastewater connections in the Pacific Northwest and Texas. NWN Water has additional signed acquisition agreements for water and wastewater utilities in the Pacific Northwest, Texas and Arizona, which pending transactions are subject to state utility commission approvals, and other closing conditions, and are expected to close during 2022. Once closed, NWN Water expects to serve approximately 145,000 customers through an aggregate total of approximately 60,000 water and wastewater connections in the Pacific Northwest, Texas and Arizona, with a cumulative investment in the water and wastewater sectors of approximately $215 million. NW Holdings continues to pursue additional acquisitions in a disciplined manner.
The water and wastewater utilities primarily serve residential and commercial customers. Water distribution operations are seasonal in nature with peak demand during warmer summer months, while wastewater is less seasonally affected. Entities generally operate in exclusive service territories with no direct competitors. Water distribution customer rates are regulated by state utility commissions while the wastewater businesses we own consist of some state regulated systems and some systems that are not rate regulated by utility commissions.
NW Natural Renewables
NW Natural Renewables is a newly formed subsidiary of NW Natural Holdings established to pursue non-regulated renewable natural gas activities. NW Natural Renewables is focused on providing cost-effective solutions to decarbonize a variety of sectors utilizing existing waste streams and renewable energy resources. 
NW Natural Renewables' first project is with a subsidiary of EDL, a global producer of sustainable distributed energy. In September 2021, a subsidiary of NW Natural Renewables and a subsidiary of EDL executed agreements, whereby the subsidiary of NW Natural Renewables committed $50 million toward the development of two production facilities that are designed to convert landfill waste gases to RNG and connect gas production to existing regional pipeline networks. Testing and commissioning of the production facilities is expected to occur in 2023. Alongside these development agreements, a subsidiary of NW Natural Renewables and a subsidiary of EDL executed agreements designed to secure a 20-year supply of RNG for NW Natural Renewables.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Properties and Facilities
NW Natural owns, or previously owned, properties and facilities that are currently being investigated that may require environmental remediation and are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to environmental matters. These laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long time frame to address certain environmental impacts. Estimates of liabilities for environmental costs are difficult to determine with precision because of the various factors that can affect their ultimate disposition. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
•the complexity of the site;
•changes in environmental laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels;
•the number of regulatory agencies or other parties involved;
•new technology that renders previous technology obsolete, or experience with existing technology that proves ineffective;
•the level of remediation required;
•variations between the estimated and actual period of time that must be dedicated to respond to an environmentally-contaminated site; and 
•the application of environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all potentially responsible parties. 

NW Natural has received recovery of a portion of such environmental costs through insurance proceeds, seeks the remainder of such costs through customer rates, and believes recovery of these costs is probable. In both Oregon and Washington, NW Natural has mechanisms to recover expenses. Oregon recoveries are subject to an earnings test. See Part II, Item 7, "Results of Operations—Regulatory Matters—Rate Mechanisms—Environmental Cost Deferral and Recovery", and Note 2 and Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information.
Greenhouse Gas Matters
For information concerning greenhouse gas matters, see Part II, Item 7, “Results of Operations—Environmental, Legislation and Regulation Matters.”
HUMAN CAPITAL
Our core values of integrity, safety, caring, service ethic, and environmental stewardship guide how we engage with customers, stakeholders, shareholders, and communities. We actively work to foster these values in our employee culture and to nurture an inclusive and equitable environment that provides opportunities, prioritizes health and safety, encourages respect and trust, and supports growth and learning. We aim to recruit and retain employees who share our core values and reﬂect our communities. 
Employees
At December 31, 2021, our workforce consisted of the following:

NW Natural: | 
Unionized employees(1) | 604 
Non-unionized employees | 569 
Total NW Natural | 1,173
Other Entities: |

Other | 3 
Total other entities | 64 
Total Employees | 1,237

(1) Members of the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Local No. 11, AFL-CIO.
NW Natural's labor agreement with members of OPEIU covers wages, benefits, and working conditions. In November 2019, NW Natural's unionized employees ratified a collective bargaining agreement that took effect on December 1, 2019 and extends to May 31, 2024, and thereafter from year to year unless either party serves notice of its intent to negotiate modifications to the collective bargaining agreement. During calendar year 2021, NW Natural did not incur any work stoppages (strikes or lockouts), and therefore, experienced zero idle days for the year.
Certain subsidiaries may receive services from employees of other subsidiaries. When such services involve regulated entities, those entities receiving services reimburse the entity providing services pursuant to shared services agreements, as applicable.
Safety
Safety is one of our greatest responsibilities to employees. In managing the business, we strive to foster a safety culture focused on prevention, open communication, collaboration, and a strong service and safety ethic. We believe employee safety is critical to our success. A portion of executives’ compensation is tied to achieving our safety metrics, and our Board of Directors regularly reviews company safety metrics. NW Natural’s health and safety policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable regulations, but we also work to go beyond compliance by striving to incorporate industry best practices and benchmarking. 
As part of our commitment to employee health and safety, we maintain regular training programs, emergency preparedness procedures, and speciﬁc training and procedures to identify hazards and handle high-risk emergency situations. Employees complete classroom instruction and hands-on, scenario-based training at our training facility in Oregon that allows employees to experience realistic situations in a controlled environment. We also host natural gas safety training events for ﬁrst responders, which prepare those first responders and NW Natural field employees to deliver an integrated, seamless response in the event of an emergency that involves or affects the natural gas system. We navigated, and continue to navigate, the COVID-19 pandemic with limited class sizes and online training to help keep people safe. We also implemented a new learning management system that went live in early 2021 and provides more efficiency and flexibility in how we train.
Our ongoing COVID-19 response is just one example of our safety culture in action. As a critical infrastructure energy company that provides an essential service to our customers, NW Natural has well-defined emergency response command structures and protocols. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, NW Natural initially mobilized its incident command team and business continuity plans in early March 2020 and initiated similar procedures at our water utilities, with a focus on the safety of our employees and the people, business partners, and communities we serve. We continue to monitor and respond to developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For employees whose role requires them to work in the field or onsite, we are following CDC, OSHA, and state specific guidance. Measures continue to include: following social distancing guidelines; use of personal protective equipment (PPE); enhanced sanitizing protocols; employee health screening protocols; remote and flexible work arrangements where possible; and other measures intended to mitigate the spread of this disease and keep our employees and customers safe and informed. Our water companies are following similar protocols. As an essential service provider, our water and natural gas utility businesses continue to serve our customers without interruption. Our experience and approach to workplace safety have enabled us to preserve business continuity while continuing to focus on our commitment to the safety of our customers, business partners and the communities we serve. 
The COVID-19 pandemic also presents challenges for employees’ emotional well-being and ability to balance work and family responsibilities. We are supporting our employees through these unusual times with the following: frequent employee surveys; virtual meetings on wellness topics; resiliency support; additional psychological support services; processes to facilitate flexible and reduced-schedule work where possible; virtual ergonomic assistance to help remote employees work safely at home; and support and access to obtain vaccines.
Employee Benefits
To attract employees and meet the needs of our workforce, NW Natural strives to offer competitive compensation and benefits packages to employees. The benefits package options vary depending on type of employee and date of hire. NW Natural continuously looks for ways to support employees’ work-life balance and well-being and this is reflected in physical, mental and financial wellness programs to meet the needs of our employees and help them care for their families. Benefits available to employees during 2021 included, among others: healthcare and other insurance coverages, wellness resources, retirement and savings plans, paid time off programs and flexible work schedules, culture and community-focused resources and opportunities, and employee recognition programs and discounts.
Talent Attraction and Development
In order to implement our business strategy and serve our customers, we depend upon our continuing ability to attract and retain diverse, talented professionals and a technically skilled workforce, and being able to transfer the knowledge and expertise of our workforce to new and increasingly diverse employees as our largely older workforce retires. A significant portion of our workforce is currently eligible or will reach retirement eligibility within the next five years, and therefore, we are focused on efforts to attract, train, and retain appropriately qualified and skilled workers to prevent loss of institutional knowledge or skills gaps.
NW Natural seeks to provide its employees with growth and development opportunities through programs designed to build skills and relationships. These programs currently include: (i) a culturally relevant mentoring program that creates opportunities for career growth by building relationships; (ii) a tuition assistance program for qualified educational pursuits; (iii) an internal class that provides participants with a big-picture understanding of the industry and company operations, equipping them to see how they contribute to NW Natural’s success and identify opportunities for career growth; (iv) internal and external continuing educational courses relevant to areas of expertise; and (v) ongoing management and leadership training programs.
We regularly monitor employee engagement and satisfaction through a variety of tools, including our annual engagement survey that is designed to enable company leaders to gather valuable feedback and guidance from employees.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We have a longstanding commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive culture that reflects and supports the communities we serve, and believe a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce contributes to long-term success. This commitment to diversity also extends to leadership positions, including members of the officer team and the Board of Directors. Our efforts in recruiting, promoting, and retaining diverse talent, building inclusive teams, and creating a culture that embraces differences are at the core of our workforce strategy. To attract diverse candidates, we work with community partners to help promote awareness of job opportunities within diverse communities. 
We have employee-led groups that develop programs and activities that build awareness around issues important to their co-workers, families, customers, and our community. Groups include the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Council, African American, Rainbow Alliance (LGBTQ+), Veterans, Somos Unidos (Latinx), and Asian American employee resource groups, Wellness Advisory Committee, Women’s Network, and Sustainability and Equity Engagement Team. We also continue to emphasize diversity, equity and inclusion values through employee training and education, including expanded diversity training as part of new hire onboarding and other diversity, equity, and inclusion education that occurs throughout the year. An area of focus going forward is to understand and increase awareness of internal systems and structures that could limit representation and equity for underrepresented employees. To that end, we are working toward revising and refocusing new manager and new hire training to include implicit bias, diversity, equity and inclusion, and anti-racism education.
