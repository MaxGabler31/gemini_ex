ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
ZimVie Inc. (“ZimVie,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 30, 2021 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (“Zimmer Biomet” or “Parent”). We were formed solely for the purpose of effecting the distribution of our outstanding shares of common stock on a pro rata basis to holders of Zimmer Biomet common stock and to hold directly or indirectly the assets and liabilities associated with the spine and dental businesses of Zimmer Biomet prior to the distribution. The distribution was completed on March 1, 2022, and resulted in ZimVie becoming a standalone, publicly traded company. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “our audited historical combined financial statements,” “our combined financial statements” and similar expressions refer to the combined financial statements of the Spine and Dental Businesses of Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., due to the fact that as of and during the periods presented in the financial statements, ZimVie was still a wholly-owned subsidiary of, and operated under those businesses of, Zimmer Biomet.
Our Company
 
ZimVie is a leading medical technology company dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for spine and dental patients worldwide. We develop, manufacture, and market a comprehensive portfolio of products and solutions designed to treat a wide range of spine pathologies and support dental tooth replacement and restoration procedures. Our broad portfolio addresses all areas of spine with market leadership in cervical disc replacement ("CDR") and vertebral body tethering to treat pediatric scoliosis, and we are well-positioned in the growing global dental implant and biomaterials market with market leadership in oral reconstruction. In 2021, we generated total third-party net sales of $1,008.8 million.
 
ZimVie was built through the acquisition and integration of over a dozen leading spine and dental businesses and brands over the course of more than 30 years. ZimVie today is the result of the combination of Zimmer, Inc.’s (“Zimmer”) and Biomet Inc.’s (“Biomet”) spine and dental portfolios in 2015, and the subsequent development of new products and technologies, as well as business development activities. As a result of our rich history and comprehensive portfolio, we are well-positioned to expand our presence in the spine surgery and tooth replacement markets we serve.
 
We estimate the global spine surgery market generated approximately $12 billion in sales in 2021. Within spine surgery, we believe that minimally invasive surgery (“MIS”) and motion preservation solutions represent the highest growth categories. We estimate the global tooth replacement market generated approximately $8 billion in sales in 2021. Within tooth replacement, our focus is on growing the dental implant, biomaterials and digital dentistry categories.

We have leading positions in a number of attractive submarkets of the broader global markets for spine and dental we serve. Our established commercial infrastructure and large sales force support our meaningful presence in both established and emerging markets.
 
We operate on a global scale and utilize a network of directly-employed sales representatives, independent sales agents, and exclusive distributors to market our products in 70 countries in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia. We have approximately 2,700 employees globally, with approximately 900 employees focusing on sales, marketing and key commercialization activities and approximately 300 employees focusing on research and development ("R&D").

Our global net sales from our dental business was $468.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $367.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.
Our Company History
 
Our proud heritage began inside Biomet in 1988 through the acquisition of EBI Medical Systems, Inc., a leader in bone-growth electrical stimulation and external bone fixation markets. In 1999, Biomet entered the dental implant market through its acquisition of Implant Innovations, Inc., and further enhanced its spine portfolio through its acquisition of Lanx, Inc. in 2013, gaining access to two spinal fusion product lines. Zimmer entered the spine and dental markets in 2003 through its acquisition of Centerpulse AG, a pure-play orthopedics company with a leading spine and dental platform.
 
Following Zimmer’s combination with Biomet, Zimmer Biomet acquired LDR Holding Corporation and Medtech SA in 2016 to accelerate the spine business into a leading position in CDR and enter the surgical robotics market. Between 2019 and 2020, the dental business was reshaped through multiple tuck-in acquisitions that expanded digital dentistry capabilities to include guided surgery services with the acquisition of Implant Concierge, LLC, as well as computer aided-design ("CAD")/computer aided-manufacturing ("CAM") software and surgery guide production capabilities with the 3DIEMME srl acquisition. In 2021, Zimmer Biomet announced the planned distribution of the spine and dental businesses into “ZimVie Inc.”, and we became a standalone, publicly-traded company on March 1, 2022.

Our employees and sales representatives have a long history of providing support and care to our communities, donating time, resources and funds to local causes. In addition, we support medical research and education, charitable and philanthropic endeavors. We believe in giving back, and we also believe it is important to operate in a socially responsible manner.
Health, Safety, and Wellness
 
We are committed to the protection of our employees, customers, communities and the environment. Our operations require the use of hazardous materials that subject us to various federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Our key areas of focus include corporate compliance with responsible hazardous waste management, recycling and emergency preparedness, as well as various initiatives to improve our health and safety programs with the goal of reducing and ultimately eliminating serious injuries.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adopted a broad approach to increased safety, including work-at-home arrangements for employees who were able to do so, working shift adjustments to decrease the number of people in our manufacturing and distribution facilities, requirements for the wearing of masks and for physical distancing, increased cleaning between shifts, readily available hand sanitizing stations, widespread signage and messaging reminding employees of the importance of these measures and other steps.
 
Human Capital Governance
 
Our Board of Directors, or the Compensation Committee of the Board at the direction of the Board, is responsible for the periodic review and monitoring of our policies and strategies related to human capital management. Our Board of Directors will receive regular updates on topics related to talent development, retention and recruiting initiatives, our diversity and inclusion program, succession planning, employee engagement and the results from our annual employee survey. Management will also work closely with the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors to establish goals and objectives and metrics in connection with the design and funding of the annual bonus opportunity for our employees.
Seasonality
 
Our business is seasonal in nature to some extent, as many of our products are used in elective procedures, which typically decline during the summer months and can increase at the end of the year once annual deductibles have been met on health insurance plans. Additionally, with sales to customers where title to product passes upon shipment, these customers may purchase items in large quantities if incentives are offered or if there are new product offerings in a market, which could cause period-to-period differences in sales. Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the typical seasonal patterns did not occur in 2021 or 2020.
Government Regulation and Compliance
 
Our operations, products and customers are subject to extensive government regulation by numerous government agencies, both within and outside the U.S. Our global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent, unpredictable and complex. There is a global trend toward increased regulatory activity related to medical products.
 

In the U.S., numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which our products are brought to market. These include, among others, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder. The FDA has enacted regulations that control all aspects of the development, manufacture, advertising, promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products, including medical devices. In addition, the FDA controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public.
 
Most of our new products fall into an FDA medical device classification that requires the submission of a Premarket Notification (510(k)) to the FDA. This process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as, that is, substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device. We must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims. Before we can market the new device, we must receive an order from the FDA finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the U.S.
 
Other devices we develop and market are in a category (class) for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and PMA requirements. The PMA process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective. The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s).
 
In January 2021, the FDA announced a new “Action Plan” to address software as a medical device and artificial intelligence and machine learning (“AI/ML”). Certain of our new products will likely incorporate innovations related to AI/ML, and therefore we will monitor developments in this area closely to determine our compliance obligations and risks.
 
Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with its quality system regulations (“QSR”), among other FDA requirements, such as requirements for advertising and promotion of our devices. Our manufacturing operations, and those of our third-party manufacturers, are required to comply with the QSR, which addresses a company’s responsibility for product design, testing and manufacturing quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. The QSR requires that each manufacturer establish a quality system by which the manufacturer monitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with FDA regulations and the manufacturer’s written specifications and procedures relating to the devices. QSR compliance is necessary to receive and maintain FDA clearance or approval to market new and existing products and is also necessary for distributing in the U.S. certain devices exempt from FDA clearance and approval requirements. The FDA conducts announced and unannounced periodic and on-going inspections of medical device manufacturers to determine compliance with the QSR. If in connection with these inspections the FDA believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures, it may issue inspectional observations on Form 483 ("Form 483") that would necessitate prompt corrective action. If FDA inspectional observations are not addressed and/or corrective action is not taken in a timely manner and to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue a warning letter (which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action) and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action, including the imposition of operating restrictions, such as a ceasing of operations, on one or more facilities, enjoining and restraining certain violations of applicable law pertaining to products, seizure of products and assessing civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA could also issue a corporate warning letter or a recidivist warning letter or negotiate the entry of a consent decree of permanent injunction with us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”). Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
The FDA, in cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), administers controls over the import of medical devices into the U.S. and can prevent the importation of products the FDA deems to violate the FDCA or its implementing regulations. The CBP imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products, including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance. We are also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain U.S. government agencies, including the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Commerce Department and the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Treasury Department. In addition, exported medical products are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the medical product is exported.
 
There are also requirements of state and local governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.
 
In many of the countries in which our products are sold, we are subject to supranational, national, regional and local regulations affecting, among other things, the development, design, manufacturing, product standards, packaging, advertising, promotion, labeling, marketing and postmarket surveillance of medical products, including medical devices. In the EU, a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with

one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. The authorities of the EU countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. A new Medical Device Regulation was published by the EU in 2017 that imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements (“MDR”). The regulation provided an implementation period and became effective on May 26, 2021. Medical devices marketed in the EU will require certification according to these new requirements, except that devices with valid CE marks, issued pursuant to the EU Medical Device Directive (“MDD”) before May 2020, can be placed on the market until May 2024.
 
Our quality management system is based upon the requirements of ISO 13485, the QSR, the MDR and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell. Our principal manufacturing sites are certified to ISO 13485 and audited at regular intervals.
 
Further, we are subject to other supranational, national, regional, federal, state and local laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims and anti-kickback laws, as well as the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state and foreign healthcare professional payment transparency laws. These laws are administered by, among others, the DOJ, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), state attorneys general and various foreign government agencies. Many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical products manufacturers in recent years. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs.
 
Our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). Our global operations are also subject to foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Bribery Act, among others. As part of our global compliance program, we seek to address anti-corruption risks proactively.
 
Our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges of substances in the air, water and land, the handling, storage and disposal of wastes and the clean-up of properties contaminated by pollutants. We do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings, capital expenditures or competitive position.
 
In addition, we are subject to federal, state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal and protection of health-related and other personal information. The FDA has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices. The FDA and the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) have issued urgent safety communications regarding cybersecurity vulnerabilities of certain medical devices.
 
In addition, certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy, security and breach notification regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). HIPAA governs the use, disclosure and security of protected health information by HIPAA “covered entities” and their “business associates.” Covered entities are health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions. A business associate is any person or entity (other than members of a covered entity’s workforce) that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information. HHS (through the Office for Civil Rights) has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with HIPAA regulations. On December 10, 2020, HHS issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPR”) to modify the HIPAA privacy rule. The proposed modifications would remove communication barriers between providers and health plans, allow individuals more access to their health information and impose new requirements on entities that receive patient data requests. Separately, HHS (through the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology) issued a new rule, effective April 5, 2021, that seeks to limit “blocking” of electronic health information by imposing data access, software licensing and inter-operability requirements on healthcare providers and information technology vendors. We intend to monitor both the NPR and the “information blocking” rule and assess their impact on the use of data in our business.
 
In addition to the FDA guidance and HIPAA regulations described above, a number of U.S. states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the processing, collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal and protection of personal information, such as social security numbers, medical and financial information and other personal information. These laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by U.S. federal laws. For example, several U.S. territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individuals, and at times regulators, the media or credit reporting agencies, if a company has experienced unauthorized access or acquisition of personal information. Other state laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and affords those individuals numerous rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information or share it with our business partners. A second law in California, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), expands the scope of the CCPA and establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency that will enforce the law and issue regulations. The CPRA is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023. On that same date, a new Virginia law, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act ("VCDPA"), which is similar in many respects to the CCPA, is scheduled to take effect. Under the

VCDPA, it is unlawful for persons subject to the law to process what is termed “sensitive data” without the affirmative, unambiguous consent of the consumer, subject to some exceptions. “Sensitive data” includes, but is not limited to, personal health diagnosis data. The Virginia Attorney General has sole authority to enforce the VCDPA, and enforcement efforts will be supported through the creation of a Consumer Privacy Fund. Regulated entities that violate the VCPDA may be subject to maximum civil penalties of $7,500 for each violation. Colorado recently enacted somewhat similar legislation, and other states are considering enacting similar privacy laws. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these emerging state laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, allow private class-action litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business.
 
Outside of the U.S., data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in Europe and the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados in Brazil, also apply to our operations in those countries in which we provide services to customers. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. The GDPR imposes, among other things, data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data regarding persons in the EU, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances, and possible substantial fines for any violations (including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of €20.0 million or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year). Governmental authorities around the world have enacted similar types of legislative and regulatory requirements concerning data protection, and additional governments are considering similar legal frameworks.
 
The interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements. Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Third-Party Reimbursement
 
We expect that sales volumes and prices of our products and services will continue to be largely dependent on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, such as governmental programs, for example, Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans, accountable care organizations and managed care programs. Reimbursement is contingent on established coding for a given procedure, favorable coverage of the codes by the third-party payors, and adequate payment for the resources used.
 
Physician coding for procedures is established by the American Medical Association (“AMA”). For coding related to spine surgery, the North American Spine Society (“NASS”) is the primary liaison to the AMA. Hospital coding is established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. All physician and hospital coding is subject to changes which could impact reimbursement and physician practice behavior.
 
Independent of the coding status, third-party payors may deny coverage based on their own criteria, including if they believe that a device or procedure does not positively impact patient outcomes, is not the most cost-effective treatment available, or is used for an unapproved indication that is not supported by published clinical literature. At various times in the past, certain insurance providers have adopted policies of not providing reimbursement for multi-level cervical arthroplasty. We have worked with our surgeon customers and NASS who, in turn, have worked with these insurance providers to supply the information, explanation and clinical data they require to categorize cervical arthroplasty as a procedure that meets the reimbursement requirements defined by their policies. At present, most major health insurance companies in the U.S. provide reimbursement for cervical arthroplasty.
 
However, certain carriers, large and small, may have policies significantly limiting coverage of AVBT, intervertebral biomechanical devices, certain morselized allografts, and/or other procedures, products or services that we offer. We will continue to provide resources to patients, surgeons, hospitals, and insurers in order to ensure patient access to care and clarity regarding reimbursement and will work to reverse any and all non-coverage policies. National and regional coverage policy decisions are subject to unforeseeable change and have the potential to impact physician behavior and reimbursement for physician services. We cannot offer definitive time frames or final outcomes regarding reversal of the coverage-limiting policies, as the process is dictated by the third-party insurance providers. For a discussion of these risks, please see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this report.
    Payment amounts are established by government and private payor programs and are subject to yearly updates based on Medicare published fee schedules and contract renegotiations, which could impact physician practice behavior. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for a wide range of medical products and services, including those in areas where we participate.
 
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines. There can be no assurance that our products will be accepted by third-party payors,

that reimbursement will be available, and/or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies (if available) will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 
In the U.S., as a result of healthcare reform, third-party payors are increasingly required to demonstrate they can improve quality and reduce costs; we accordingly see an increase in pre-approval/prior authorizations and non-coverage policies citing higher levels of published clinical evidence required for medical therapies and technologies. Even fee-for-service Medicare began requiring prior authorization of anterior cervical fusion with decompression cases starting on July 1, 2021. In addition, insured individuals are facing increased premiums and higher out-of-pocket costs for medical coverage, including higher deductibles and coinsurance percentages, which can lead a patient to delay medical treatment. An increasing number of insured individuals receive their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. The percentage of individuals covered by managed care programs is expected to grow in the U.S. over the next decade.
 
Overall escalating costs of medical products and services has led to, and is expected to continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. There can be no assurance that third-party reimbursement and coverage will be available or adequate, or that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not adversely affect the demand for our products and services or our ability to sell these products and services on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payor coverage or reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. For a discussion of these risks, please see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this report.
