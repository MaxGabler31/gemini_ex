 ITEM 1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
  
  THE COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS
 
 GrowLife, Inc. (“GrowLife” or the “Company”) is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is headquartered in Kirkland, Washington. We were founded in 2012 with the Closing of the Agreement and Plan of Merger with SGT Merger Corporation.
 
  GrowLife’s goal is to become the nation’s largest cultivation facility service provider
 
  for the production of organics, herbs and greens and plant-based medicines.
 
 GrowLife provides essential and hard-to-find goods including growing media, industry-leading hydroponics equipment, organic plant nutrients, and thousands more products through its knowledgeable representatives and our distribution channels, to specialty grow operations across the United States and Canada.
 
 We primarily sell supplies through our wholly owned subsidiary, GrowLife Hydroponics, Inc. GrowLife also distributes and sells over 15,000 products along with a handful of its own branded products through its e-commerce distribution channels, ShopGrowLife.com, Greners.com and GrowLifeEco.com, as well as through GrowLife licensed retail storefronts. GrowLife and its business units are organized and directed to operate strictly in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws.
 
  The GrowLife mission is to measure its success by its customer’s success;
 
  serving cultivators of all sizes as a reliable business partner and its shareholders with value and trust.
 
 The ‘their success is our success’ focus has helped us understand the pains and needs our customers are enduring and the many products and services we can provide to help them grow. We recognize that the cost of customer acquisition is 10x higher than retention so it is in GrowLife’s best interest to retain its customers by supporting their needs with innovative offerings, lower pricing and reliable delivery. The indoor cultivation industry, primarily driven by indoor Cannabis farming, is in its formative stages where it is developing a recurring track record. Due to the conflicting laws and policies throughout the United States our customers consist mostly of smaller, early-stage companies that face unusual challenges not experienced in most larger established industries.
 
 As a result, agility takes the place over predictability and trust surpasses price and convenience. Therefore, there are few public or billion dollar companies operating in this industry. Thus, the GrowLife mission of aligning itself with the success of its customer’s.
 
  GrowLife’s vision of indoor cultivation is that it is
 
  inevitable; not another gardening alternative.
 
 We seek to support the mission of GrowLife helping its customers be successful by minimizing the operating costs of indoor cultivators of fruits, vegetables and Cannabis so they can better serve their markets and customers.
 
 Outdoor farming is a wasteful, destructive and an inefficient use of precious resources. Current water, land and harvest cycles are limited and, if left unchecked, will fail to support the world’s population growth. However, indoor cultivation allows our customers to replicate nature in a controllable manner that uses a fraction of water and land while providing 2–5 times the crop cycles of outdoor. The challenge is in getting the economics right. Subsidies are not the answer. Even many large-scale indoor grow operations with large capital investments have had a difficult time staying in business because the poor economic models fail to deliver a profit. Fruits and vegetables have limited revenue benefit due to their low prices and saturated supply from international and domestic growers.
 
 Cannabis on the other hand currently has an attractive revenue model and valuation multiple but modest demand of about 5% of the population due to shadows cast by interstate commerce restrictions, banking issues and threatening federal laws. However, Cannabis laws are not the only expected changes. We must prepare for significantly lower prices if Cannabis is to become a mainstream alternative to beer, wine and other alcohol in the future. Expecting a $12 Cannabis cigarette to drop to $1 over the next couple of years is not unreasonable.
 
 Therefore, as an indoor cultivation industry, we must lower production costs to provide local, safer, healthier and affordable food and Cannabis crops. We see this as the game changer: Over time we must support a production cost at 10% of the current price point.  This means increasing efficiencies, scaling up production volumes and driving down indoor operating costs. Given this vision of the future, lowering our customer’s production costs serves as our compass to mergers, acquisitions and partnerships.

 To profitably achieve such a goal, we see GrowLife building out five strategic pillars. These pillars represent unfulfilled needs, which if capitalized upon, can provide PHOT investors with a lasting diversified portfolio of products and services.
 
 GrowLife’s five pillars of planned growth are 1) direct commercial sales, 2) products, 3) online markets, 4) consumer GrowLife Cube, and 5) retail --- are organized across four audience-centric divisions. We sell to commercial customers through our GrowLife Commercial division to large-scale customers for both hydroponics and FreeFit, our business materials products.
 
 GrowLife will continue to provide growing supplies to cultivators, known as “picks and shovels” to the green rush industry, we are investing in developing proprietary products that will enhance higher gross profit, differentiation and a greater ecological benefit and value to the industry through GrowLife Innovations, Inc., a whole-owned subsidiary. For example, GrowLife recently acquired FreeFit building material assets which bring several benefits to the Company: Revenue, higher gross profits and intellectual properties that will serve as the foundation to upcoming products including complete GrowLife room solutions. These solutions are aimed at providing lower production costs for our legal commercial customers that are growing at large scales. Over the last three months the Company organized its operating structure into four divisions to be aligned with its business initiatives towards focused growth.
 
 
The other GrowLife divisions will continue to distribute and sell over 15,000 products and FreeFit through its e-commerce distribution channel, ShopGrowLife.com.New products will be developed by GrowLife Innovations Inc., the research and development arm of the company, and GrowLife Retail will drive our licensed retail storefronts. GrowLife, Inc. and its divisions are organized and directed to operate strictly in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws.

 We focus on customer success. In that regard, we believe that the indoor cultivation industry will continue to experience significant growth and, as a result, serving this industry has become highly competitive, cash intensive and customer centric.  However, we have plans to address these challenges. 
 
 First, the opportunity to sell both infrastructure equipment and recurring supplies to the indoor cultivation industry is constantly increasing as demand for indoor cultivation grows across the United States and Canada. GrowLife believes the demand will continue to grow and more states and municipalities will enact laws and regulations allowing for greater indoor cultivation activities. GrowLife continues with its multi-faceted distribution strategy, which we believe serves customers in the following manner: Direct sales to large commercial customers through GrowLife Hydroponics, retail licensing through licensed partners for local convenience, and e-commerce via ShopGrowLife.com to fulfill orders across the nation from customers of all sizes. 
 
 Second, selling through multiple channels with readily available products is foundational to GrowLife, however differentiation comes from unique products available only from GrowLife. In October 2017 we formed GrowLife Innovations, Inc., which is where we housed our recently acquired building material assets. FreeFit® is a patented product line of eco-friendly and easy to install vinyl floor tiles with patterns and prints that can provide passive (no resource demands such as power) benefits to our customers. GrowLife is currently testing custom configurations with cultivators to quantify its economic value to customers. Building materials is a starting point for GrowLife Innovations. Other products and services are being developed and tested with plans to bring them to market over the next few months.
 
 Third, GrowLife’s customers come in different stages from small caregiver cultivators to large 80,000+ square foot commercial operations.  Along with our business-to-business (B2B) focus we have been expanding to the business-to-consumer (B2C) by offering the GrowLife Cube subscription products. We recognize demand is increasing from small, aspiring cultivation consumers across the country seeking to learn and use a complete indoor growing solution.  To address this demand, we packaged GrowLife Cube, an entry-level offering for consumers to get hands-on experience with indoor growing.  Although many still buy the components separately, we are working on developing videos and supplier tools to attract them to this one-stop shop program.  Many states are giving individuals the legal freedom to cultivate crops in their own home and GrowLife Cube gives them the necessary tools.

 GrowLife started the expansion of sales and store personnel and marketing efforts with continued funding from Chicago Venture Partners, L.P. Chicago Venture is supportive in the expansion of the sales and marketing teams in a growing market. GrowLife is growing in several markets including California and Canada. GrowLife received $1 million in equity financing in February 2018 for expansion in addition to continuing as-needed capital for operating costs.
 
 GrowLife also considered the lack of capital access since 2014 and the new funding vehicles with Chicago Venture Partners, L.P. Operations were significantly impacted during 2014- 2016 as a result of the lack of access to capital. GrowLife did not have cash to ship all orders. With the addition of GrowLife’s new partners, we have access to capital and are growing our sales again.
 
  Resumed Trading of our Common Stock
 
 On October 17, 2017, we were informed by Alpine Securities Corporation (“Alpine”) that Alpine had demonstrated compliance with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) Rule 6432 and Rule 15c2-11 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We filed an amended application with the OTC Markets to list the Company’s common stock on the OTCQB and begin to trade on this market as of March 28, 2018.

   –
 Consumer interest in organic foods and hydroponic growing has also increased as disposable income continues to rise.


   –
 Given the discretionary nature of the industry’s products, demand is heavily influenced by fluctuations in the overall level of consumer disposable income and consumer confidence in the economy. Over the five years to 2017, per capita disposable income is anticipated to grow an annualized 1.4%. Rising disposable income increases consumers’ willingness to purchase luxuries such as high-priced hydroponic growing equipment and organic foods.


   –
 Impact of the Cannabis Industry


   o
 According to data released by Forbes, the medical marijuana market is expected to generate $6.7 billion in 2017 alone. Given the size of the medical marijuana market, a rising number of entrepreneurs have invested in hydroponic growing equipment to be part of the medical marijuana gold rush. This investment has been one of the primary drivers of the aggressive growth that this industry has experienced over the past five years.


   o
 In certain states, patients with medical marijuana cards are also allowed to grow limited quantities of marijuana for personal use. This has encouraged patients to purchase hydroponic growing equipment and pursue small-scale marijuana cultivation.


 Competitive advantages:
 
   –
 Most hydroponic growing equipment stores are small business operations that serve their immediate geographic areas. GrowLife serves a nationwide audience with expansion into Canada.


 Growth Outlook:
 
 “The industry is growing faster than overall GDP”
 
  IBIS World expects the Cannabis industry revenue to grow an annualized 1.7% to $750.2 million over the five years to 2022.
 
 Factors:
 
   –
 Increasing consumer focus on healthy eating habits will likely spur demand as more consumers seek out organic and pesticide-free produce and opt to grow their own or purchase locally produced organic foods made with hydroponic growing equipment.


   –
 Medical and recreational marijuana is expected to be approved in an increasing number of US states over the next five years, which will lead more patients and entrepreneurs to buy marijuana and hydroponic growing equipment to fulfill demand for this growing market.


   –
 This industry will also continue to benefit from risk-averse local farmers wishing to break their reliance on weather conditions that may be increasingly volatile.


   –
 IBIS World estimates that per capita disposable income will rise at an annualized rate of 2.7% over the five years to 2022.


   –
 The US Department of Agriculture reported in 2016 that the number of certified organic food operators increased nearly 12.0% from 2015, and this growth is expected to remain high over the next five years.

 Medical and Recreational Marijuana Growing Industry
 
 Industry Definition:
 
 This emerging industry pertains to those engaged in the practice of cultivating and producing legal marijuana plants for the medical and recreational consumer markets.
 
 US 2016 Key Industry Statistics:
 
   –
 In 2016, the Medical and Recreational Marijuana Growing industry generated $3.5 billion in gross revenue with total profits of $233.4 million.


   –
 The industry grew 28.3% from 2011 to 2016 and is expected to continuing growing at a rate of 33.5% through 2021.


   –
 As of 2016, there are approximately 148,294 businesses engaged in the industry, which contribute $957.6 million in wages and salaries to the nation’s economy.


   –
 No companies have been identified as “major players”.


   –
 Medical Marijuana patients with severe pain comprise the largest market segment for the industry, accounting for 64.6% of the market in 2016, with recreational consumers accounting for 14.1% of the market. The remaining market share is shared by consumers purchasing products for treatment of other various medical conditions.


   –
 The industry’s average profit margin, defined as earnings before interest and taxes, varies greatly across the industry because of the myriad of laws governing medical and recreational marijuana from state to state. Industry-wide margins have grown on account of the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington and are expected to grow as more legalization takes effect including California.



 Key Industry Drivers:
 
   –
 Medical marijuana growers continue to benefit from the steadily aging population. Chronic illnesses have become more prevalent as the population continues to age, driving demand for medical marijuana.


   –
 An estimated 2.6 million people use marijuana for medicinal purposes, and this segment of the US population is anticipated to increase drastically over the next five years.


   –
 More than two-thirds of Americans now live in jurisdictions that have legalized either the medical or adult use of marijuana.

 “The industry is growing at a faster rate than the US economy”
 
   –
 Industry revenue is estimated to increase at an annualized rate of 33.5% to $15.0 billion over the five years to 2021.


 Factors:
 
   –
 Continued legalization on the state level will increase accessibility to medical and recreational marijuana, increasing nationwide demand.


   
 
5


  
 
   –
 Growing acceptance of the marijuana products will increase demand. According to a poll conducted by Gallup, 36.0% of Americans between the ages of 18 to 29 have tried marijuana in 2013, compared with just 8.0% in 1969.


   –
 The level of household income determines consumers’ ability to purchase medical marijuana products. While prescription products can be essential for health and therefore less susceptible to changes in consumer expenditure, the unconventional nature of the industry’s products make it subject to changes in disposable income. As a result, an increase in disposable income will boost demand for medical marijuana growers.

  Key Market Priorities
 
 Our goal of becoming the nation’s largest cultivation facility service provider for the production of organics, herbs and greens and plant-based medicines requires GrowLife to: (i) expand our nationwide, multi-channel sales network presence, (ii) offer the best terms for the full range of build-out equipment and consumable supplies, and (iii) deliver superior, innovative products.
 
 First, we provide distribution through retail, e-commerce and direct sales to have national coverage and serve cultivators of all sizes. Each channel offers varying pricing for differing benefits. Retail sells at list price by offering inventory convenience, e-commerce provides lower prices without requiring local inventory, and direct sales delivers the best bid price for high-volume purchasers. Additional points of service may be added through existing distribution locations and services. This may be done in several manners and programs that may incorporate cultivator-centric locations with other retailer store owners.
 
 Second, we serve the needs of all size cultivators and each one’s unique formulation, or ‘recipe’. We provide thousands of varieties of supplies from dozens of vendors and distributors. More importantly is our experience of knowing which products to recommend under each customer’s circumstance.
 
 And third, our experience with extensive customers allows us to determine specific product needs and sources to test new designs. Lights, pesticides, nutrients, building materials and growing systems are some examples of products that GrowLife can provide. Popular name branded products are seeking to be part of the GrowLife Company in many forms. In exchange, we can market their products in a unique manner over generic products.
 
 Our company can expand with these strategies until it serves more indoor cultivators throughout the country. Once a customer is engaged, we can gradually expand their purchasing market share by providing greater economic benefit to the customers who buy more products from GrowLife than from other suppliers.
 
  Employees
 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had thirteen full-time and part-time employees. Marco Hegyi, our Chief Executive Officer, is based in Kirkland, Washington. Mark E. Scott, our Chief Financial Officer, is based primarily in Seattle, Washington. In addition, we have approximately six full and part time consultants located throughout the United States and Canada who operate our businesses. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
 Key Partners
 
 Our key customers vary by state and are expected to be more defined as the company moves from its retail walk-in purchasing sales strategy to serving cultivation facilities directly and under predictable purchasing contracts. 
 
   
 
7


  
 
 Our key suppliers include distributors such as HydroFarm, Urban Horticultural Supply and Sunlight Supply to product-specific suppliers. All the products purchased and resold are applicable to indoor growing for organics, greens, and plant-based medicines.
 
  Competition
 
 Certain large commercial cultivators have found themselves willing to assume their own equipment support by buying large volume purchased directly from certain suppliers and distributors such as Sunlight Supplies and HydroFarm. Other key competitors on the retail side consist of local and regional hydroponic resellers of indoor growing equipment. On the e-commerce business, GrowersHouse.com, Hydrobuilder.com and smaller online resellers using Amazon and eBay e-commerce market systems.
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 
 Our intellectual property consists of brands and their related trademarks and websites, customer lists and affiliations, product know-how and technology, and marketing intangibles.
 
 Our other intellectual property is primarily in the form of trademarks and domain names. We also hold rights to several website addresses related to our business including websites that are actively used in our day-to-day business such as www.shopgrowlife.com, www.freefit.com, www.growlifeinc.com, www.growlifeeco.com and www.greners.com.
 
 On October 3, 2017, we closed the acquisition of 51% of the Purchased Assets from David Reichwein, a Pennsylvania resident, GIP International Ltd, a Hong Kong corporation and DPR International LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability corporation. The Purchased Assets include intellectual property, copy rights and trademarks related to reflective tiles and flooring.
  
  On February 16, 2018, we entered into an Addendum (the “First Addendum”) to amend the terms between the Company and David Reichwein. Pursuant to the First Addendum, we purchased the remaining 49% of the Purchased Assets in exchange for a one-time payment of $250,000 and the cancellation of Mr. Reichwein’s right to receive a 10% commission on certain sales of Free Fit products as was set forth in Mr. Reichwein’s employment agreement. In exchange for the cancellation of the commission in the employment agreement, Mr. Reichwein was granted the opportunity to earn up to two $100,000 cash bonuses and an aggregate common stock bonus of up to 7,500,000 shares if certain revenue and gross margin goals are met in 2018.
  
 We have a policy of entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, some of our vendors and customers as necessary.
 
  Government Regulation
 
 Currently, there are thirty states plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. There are currently eight states and the District of Columbia that allow recreational use of cannabis. As of March 28, 2018, the policy and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or may not be permitted on the basis of state law. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis on a regional or national basis may directly and adversely affect the willingness of customers of GrowLife to invest in or buy products from GrowLife. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect revenues and profits of the GrowLife companies.
 
 All this being said, many reports show that the majority of the American public is in favor of making medical cannabis available as a controlled substance to those patients who need it. The need and consumption will then require cultivators to continue to provide safe and compliant crops to consumers. The cultivators will then need to build facilities and use consumable products, which GrowLife provides.
  
  THE COMPANY’S COMMON STOCK
  
 On April 10, 2014, we received notice from the SEC that trading of our common stock on the OTCBB was to be suspended from April 10, 2014 through April 24, 2014. The SEC issued its order pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. According to the notice received by us from the SEC: “It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that the public interest and the protection of investors require a suspension of trading in the securities of GrowLife, Inc. because of concerns regarding the accuracy and adequacy of information in the marketplace and potentially manipulative transactions in GrowLife’s common stock.” We never received notice from the SEC that and we were formally being investigated.
  
 The suspension of trading eliminated our market makers, resulted in our trading on the grey sheets, resulted in legal proceedings and restricted our access to capital.
