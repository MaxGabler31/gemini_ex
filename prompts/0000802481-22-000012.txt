Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation (referred to herein as “Pilgrim’s,” “PPC,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or similar terms) is primarily engaged in the production, processing, marketing and distribution of fresh, frozen and value-added chicken and pork products to retailers, distributors and foodservice operators. JBS S.A., through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (together, “JBS”), beneficially owns 80.21% of our outstanding common stock. 
We market our balanced portfolio of fresh, prepared and value-added meat products to a diverse set of over 55,000 customers across the U.S., the U.K. and Europe, Mexico and in approximately 125 other countries. Our sales efforts are largely targeted towards the foodservice industry, principally chain restaurants and food processors, such as Chick-fil-A® and retail customers, including grocery store chains and wholesale clubs, such as Kroger®, Costco®, Publix® and H-E-B® in the U.S., chain restaurants such as McDonald’s® and grocery store chains such as Tesco and Waitrose in the U.K. and Europe, and grocery store chains such as Wal-Mart® in Mexico.
As a vertically integrated company, we are able to control every phase of the production process, which helps us manage food safety and quality, control margins and improve customer service. Our plants are strategically located to ensure that customers timely receive fresh products. With our global network of approximately 5,100 growers, 35 feed mills, 48 hatcheries, 43 processing plants, 37 prepared foods cook plants, 30 distribution centers, 10 rendering facilities and four pet food plants, we believe we are well-positioned to supply the growing demand for our products.
On September 24, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the equity of the specialty meats and ready meals businesses of Kerry Group plc for cash of £695.3 million, or $954.1 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments. The specialty meats and ready meals businesses of Kerry Group plc, which have subsequently changed their name to Pilgrim’s Food Masters (“PFM”), are leading manufacturers of branded and private label meats, meat snacks, food to-go products in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland and a leading ethnic chilled and frozen ready meals business in the U.K. The acquired operations are included in our U.K. and Europe reportable segment.
On October 15, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the equity of Tulip Limited and its subsidiaries (together, “Tulip”) from Danish Crown AmbA for £311.3 million, or $393.3 million for cash. Tulip, which has subsequently changed its name to Pilgrim’s Pride Ltd. (“PPL”), is a leading, integrated prepared pork supplier headquartered in Warwick, U.K. This acquisition solidifies Pilgrim’s as a leading European food company, creating one of the largest integrated prepared foods businesses in the U.K. The PPL operations are included in our U.K. and Europe reportable segment.
We operate on the basis of a 52/53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday falling on or before December 31. Any reference we make to a particular year, for example, 2021, applies to our fiscal year and not the calendar year. Fiscal 2021 was a 52-week fiscal year.
Reportable Segments
We operate in three reportable segments: U.S., U.K. and Europe, and Mexico. We either produce or purchase for resale chicken and pork products through our operations in the U.S., the U.K. and continental Europe, and Mexico. We conduct separate operations in the U.S., the U.K., continental Europe, Puerto Rico and Mexico; however, for geographic reporting 
    
purposes, we include Puerto Rico with our U.S. operations. See “Note 19. Reportable Segments” of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report for additional information.

Raw Materials
Grains. The Company utilizes various raw materials in its operations, including corn, soybean meal and wheat, along with various other ingredients from which the Company produces its own formulated feeds. In 2021, corn, soybean meal and wheat accounted for approximately 52.9%, 41.0% and 6.0% of our feed costs, respectively. The production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by the global level of supply inventories, demand for feed ingredients, the agricultural policies of the U.S. and foreign governments and weather patterns throughout the world. We attempt to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our profitability by decreasing the amount of our products that are sold under longer term fixed-price contracts, broadening our product portfolio and expanding the variety of contracts within our book of business. To also manage this risk, we purchase derivative financial instruments. The Company has long-standing relationships with its sources of grain and other feed ingredients and expects to have an adequate supply for its present needs. 
Live chicks. The Company’s chicken operations purchase one-day old chicks from a few major breeders. These chicks, when mature, serve as the grandparent and parent stock of the broilers that these operations process for consumption. Should breeder stock from its present suppliers not be available for any reason, the Company believes that it could obtain adequate breeder stock from other suppliers in the regions in which it operates.
Live pigs. The Company’s pork operations maintain a pig production base that makes up approximately 50.0% of the total number of pigs processed by the Company each year. Additionally, the Company’s pork operations procure live pigs for slaughter within a few days of purchase from numerous independent farmers throughout the U.K. Live pigs sourced from independent farmers make up approximately 50.0% of the total number of pigs processed by the Company each year. Although we generally expect adequate supply of live pigs in the U.K., there may be periods of imbalance in supply and demand.
Trademarks 
We own registered trademarks which are used in connection with our activity in our business. The trademarks are important to the overall marketing and branding of our products. All major trademarks in our business are registered. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks. As long as the Company continues to use its trademarks, they are renewed indefinitely. Some of the more significant owned or licensed trademarks used by the Company or its affiliates are Pilgrim’s®, Just BARE®, Gold’n Pump®, Gold Kist®, County Pride®, Pierce Chicken®, Pilgrim’s® Mexico, County Post®, Savoro, To-Ricos, Del Dia®, Moy Park, O’Kane, Richmond, Fridge Raiders and Denny.
Seasonality
    
The demand for our chicken products generally is greatest during the spring and summer months and lowest during the winter months. The demand for our pork products generally is higher during the summer and peaks during the winter primarily due to the holiday season.
Key Customers
Our two largest customers accounted for approximately 12.0% and 13.1% of our net sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively. No single customer accounted for ten percent or more of our net sales in either 2021 or 2020.
Competition
The chicken and pork industry in the U.S., the U.K., continental Europe and Mexico is highly competitive. The competitive factors in our business include price, product quality, product development, brand identification, breadth of product line and customer service. We believe that being a vertically integrated chicken company and having a fully integrated supply chain in the pork business provides us with long-term cost and quality advantages over non-vertically integrated and other processors. We utilize numerous advertising and marketing techniques to develop and strengthen trade and consumer awareness and increase brand loyalty for consumer products. We believe our efforts to achieve and maintain brand awareness and loyalty help to achieve greater price premiums than would otherwise be the case in certain markets and support and expand our product distribution. We actively seek to identify and address consumer preferences by using sophisticated qualitative and quantitative consumer research techniques in key geographic markets to discover and validate new product ideas, packaging designs and methods. Although poultry and pork are relatively inexpensive in comparison with other meats, we compete indirectly with the producers of other meats and fish, since changes in the relative prices of these foods may alter consumer buying patterns.
Regulation and Environmental Matters
The poultry and pork industries are subject to government regulation, particularly in the health, workplace safety and environmental areas, including provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, treatment and disposal of agricultural and food processing wastes, the use and maintenance of refrigeration systems, ammonia-based chillers, noise, odor and dust management, the operation of mechanized processing equipment and other operations, storm water, air emissions, treatment, storage and disposal of wastes, handling of hazardous substances and remediation of contaminated soil, surface water and groundwater, by the Centers for Disease Control, the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and state and local regulatory authorities in the U.S. and by similar governmental agencies in the U.K., continental Europe and Mexico. Our chicken processing facilities in the U.S. are subject to on-site examination, inspection and regulation by the USDA. The FDA inspects the production of our feed mills in the U.S. Our food processing facilities and feed mills in the U.K., continental Europe and Mexico are subject to on-site examination, inspection and regulation by government agencies that perform functions similar to those performed by the USDA and FDA.
The EPA, environmental authorities in the U.K., continental Europe and Mexico, and/or other U.S. or Mexican state and local authorities may, from time to time, adopt revisions to environmental rules and regulations, and/or changes in the terms and conditions of our environmental permits, with which we must comply. Compliance with existing or new environmental requirements, including more stringent limitations imposed or expected in recently-renewed or soon-to be renewed environmental permits, may require capital expenditures and operating expenses which may be significant. 
In the U.K., all Moy Park poultry farms which exceed a threshold size of 40,000 birds placed are required to carry out activities in compliance with their environmental permits and they must use Best Available Techniques in order to achieve a high level of environmental protection. PPL’s sites are independently audited and certified by the British Retail Consortium standard. Many of PPL’s sites are certified by additional and traceability schemes including Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Assured, Soil Association, Organic Farmers and Growers and Assured Food Standards.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 26, 2021, we employed almost 59,400 persons. Our success is largely dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our employees. We rely on an adequate number of skilled employees to serve in critical production roles, such as processing workers and operations supervisors. In managing our business, we focus on a number of human capital measures or objectives, which are rooted in our core values and include the following items:
Health and Safety. A core tenet of our Company is the promotion of a safe and healthy working environment. Key examples of our focus and commitment include:
•We engage with our team members through the use of safety committees and other safety initiatives to improve the overall safety of the workplace and advance a safety first culture.
    
•We train team members on how to identify physical hazards, conduct focused daily, monthly and annual physical hazard assessments at all facilities, ensure that all identified physical hazards are logged and ensure timely remediation.
•Leveraging third party experts, we conduct regular ergonomic assessments, ensure that all identified ergonomic issues are logged and ensure timely remediation.
•We conduct safety audits of all facilities on an annual basis. These audits include auditing the physical state of the plant, policies, safety culture and our occupational health clinics.
•Our efforts have resulted in year-over-year reductions in severe injuries, lost time incident rate and days away restricted or transferred of 13%, 6% and 8%, respectively. 
•As discussed in “Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Impact of COVID-19,” we have implemented and continue to implement numerous health and safety policies and procedures focused on reducing the spread of novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and protecting our facility workers from risks of illness while maintaining our business continuity.
Diversity and Inclusion. We believe that promoting diversity and inclusion among our workforce helps to create a trusting and productive workplace. We encourage the management teams at each facility to hire from the local regions in which they are located. In addition:
•Our Equal Employment Opportunity Policy (“EEO Policy”) affirms our commitment to employ and support employees of all races, religions, colors, national origins, sexes, sexual orientations, gender identities and ages. Through the EEO Policy, we have been involved in diversity hiring initiatives and partnered with universities with an aim of recruiting from a diverse talent pool. 
•We track our progress in our efforts to promote diversity and inclusion. For example, in 2021, women comprised 41%, 38% and 35% of our total workforce in the U.S., the U.K. and Europe, and Mexico, respectively, and 68% of our total workforce in the U.S. were minorities.
•Our management team members are expected to attend People First leadership training, which includes a model dedicated to training and awareness on diversity and inclusion.
•We provide workshops on diversity and inclusion for our employees and we engage in targeted recruitment at 20 of the nation’s largest historically black colleges and universities.
Retention and Career Development. We are committed to retaining talented employees at both production and management levels by offering competitive compensation and benefits, as well as leadership training and development opportunities. 
•We strive to provide competitive pay to our team members and reward top performers. Our benefits offerings include a minimum paid time off and paid sick leave for salaried employees, life and disability insurance and Company-matching retirement plans. 
•We have extensive leadership training programs, such as our Supervisor Development Program, created to help identify and develop production workers into frontline supervisors, the aforementioned People First Program, designed to equip frontline supervisors with the behavioral and technical skills needed to effectively lead their production teams and our Summit Program, designed to improve the skill set of our senior leadership team. We have found that recognizing our employees’ efforts through training for continued advancement strengthens their performance and helps with our goals to achieve business results. Our employees completed over 350,000 training hours during 2021 and over 330,000 training hours during 2020.
Community Support. We are focused on supporting the communities in which we operate and serve. 
•Hometown Strong Initiative. During 2020, we launched our Hometown Strong initiative to help the communities in which we operate respond to the unexpected challenges on society, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe the Hometown Strong initiative will provide consequential investment projects and help them prepare for unanticipated challenges and build for the future. For 2020, we committed to Hometown Strong donations of $20.0 million and during the year ended December 27, 2020 we recorded $15.0 million in incremental donations expense relating to this initiative.
    
•Tomorrow Fund. During 2019, we launched the Tomorrow Fund, a scholarship program designed to support the collegiate scholastic pursuits of our employees and their direct dependents. The Tomorrow Fund awards certain employees scholarships to an eligible university of their choice.
•Better Futures. During 2021, we launched Better Futures, the largest privately funded free community college program in rural America, offering free community college to our team members and their dependents. So far, nearly 400 team members or dependents have signed up and nearly 200 have already started their selected academic pathway.
Employee Relations. We respect our team members’ rights of association, including by joining labor unions and collective bargaining. Approximately 45.4% of our workforce are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. For additional information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our performance depends on favorable labor relations with our employees and our compliance with labor laws. Any deterioration of those relations or increase in labor costs due to our compliance with labor laws could adversely affect our business.”
