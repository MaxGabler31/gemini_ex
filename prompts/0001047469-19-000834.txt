Company Overview 

         Boingo helps the world stay connected to the people and things they love. 
         We acquire long-term wireless rights at large venues like airports transportation hubs, stadiums/arenas, military bases, multifamily properties, universities, convention centers, and office campuses; we build high-quality wireless networks such as distributed antenna systems ("DAS"), Wi-Fi, and small cells at those venues; and we monetize the wireless networks through a number of products and services. 
         Over the past 17 years, we've built a global footprint of wireless networks that we estimate reaches more than a billion consumers annually. We operate 58 DAS networks containing approximately 29,900 DAS nodes, and believe we are the largest operator of indoor DAS networks in the world. Our Wi-Fi network, which includes locations we manage and operate ourselves (our "managed and operated locations") as well as networks managed and operated by third-parties with whom we contract for access (our "roaming" networks), includes over 1.2 million commercial Wi-Fi hotspots in more than 100 countries around the world. 
 2

           We generate revenue from our wireless networks in a number of ways, including our DAS, small cells, multifamily and wholesale Wi-Fi offerings, which are targeted towards businesses, and our military, retail, and advertising offerings, which are targeted towards consumers. 
         We generate wholesale revenue from telecom operators that pay us build-out fees and recurring access fees so that their cellular customers may use our DAS or small cell networks at locations where we manage and operate the wireless network. In 2018, DAS revenue accounted for approximately 38% of our revenue. 
         Military/multifamily revenue, which is driven by military personnel who purchase Wi-Fi services on military bases, and multifamily revenue, which is driven by property owners who purchase network installation services and recurring monthly Wi-Fi services and support, accounted for approximately 31% of our total revenue in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we have grown our military subscriber base to approximately 138,000, an increase of approximately 6.2% over the prior year. Retail revenue, which is driven by consumers who purchase a recurring monthly subscription plan or one-time Wi-Fi access, accounted for approximately 7% of our total revenue in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our retail subscriber base was approximately 122,000, a decrease of approximately 35.1% over the prior year. 
         Our wholesale customers such as telecom operators, cable companies, technology companies, and enterprise software/services companies, pay us usage-based Wi-Fi network access and software licensing fees to allow their customers' access to our footprint worldwide. Wholesale Wi-Fi revenue also includes financial institutions and other enterprise customers who provide Boingo as a value-added service for their customers. In 2018, wholesale Wi-Fi revenue accounted for approximately 19% of our revenue. 
         We also generate revenue from advertisers that seek to reach consumers via sponsored Wi-Fi access. In 2018, advertising and other revenue accounted for approximately 5% of our revenue. 
         Our customer agreements for certain DAS networks include both a fixed and variable fee structure with the highest percentage of sales typically occurring in the fourth quarter of each year and the lowest percentage of sales occurring in the first quarter of each year. Our multifamily network installation services have historically been performed for the student housing market with the highest percentage of revenues typically occurring in the second and third quarter of each year. We expect these trends to continue. We do not expect significant seasonal impact for any of our other products. 
         We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in April 2001 under the name Project Mammoth, Inc. and changed our name to Boingo Wireless, Inc. in October 2001. Our principal executive offices are located in Los Angeles, California. Our website address is www.boingo.com. The information on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 


Industry Overview 

         Today, consumers own multiple connected devicessmartphones, laptops, tablets, wearables, and more. In addition, mobile data growth is exploding, driven by the growth of wireless devices and the increase in high-bandwidth activities like video streaming, online gaming, and mobile apps. According to Cisco's 2018 Visual Networking Index ("CVNI"), global mobile data traffic is forecasted to grow seven-fold from 2017 to 2022, a compound annual growth rate of 46%. CVNI further estimates that by 2022, there will be 3.6 "connected" devices for every human on the planet. That means 28.5 billion networked devices by 2022. 
         The mobile data explosion has fueled the growth of higher-generation network connectivity to address the demand for more bandwidth, higher security, and faster connectivity. Telecom operators have started trials for 5G, which will provide higher bandwidth (greater than 1 gigabit per second), 
 3

   broader coverage, and ultra-low latency. Significant 5G deployments are expected by 2020 subject to certain gating factors like standards development, regulatory approval, and spectrum availability. 
 


Challenges Facing Our Industry 

         The mobile Internet is a complex and constantly evolving ecosystem comprised of dozens of manufacturers, many different operating systems, and a number of different wireless technologies utilizing both licensed and unlicensed spectrum. This complexity is amplified as new device models and operating systems are released, new categories of devices become Internet enabled, and new network technologies emerge. 
         To cope with the significant increase in mobile Internet data traffic, wireless network operators must build denser networks that are closer to the end consumer, explore solutions to offload network traffic from congested, licensed spectrum onto more efficient unlicensed spectrum, and invest in technologies that will enable the convergence of licensed and unlicensed spectrum. We expect our wireless networks to play a significant role in helping meet the ever-increasing data demands of connected consumers. 
 


Our Strategy 

         We believe we are the leading global provider of neutral-host commercial mobile Wi-Fi Internet solutions and indoor DAS services. Our overall business strategy is simple: acquire long-term wireless rights at large venues; build high-quality wireless networks at those venues; and monetize the wireless networks through a number of products and services. In support of our overall business strategy, we are focused on the following objectives: 
 

 Expand our footprint of managed and operated and aggregated networks.  We
intend to continue to grow our global network of managed and operated DAS, Wi-Fi and small cell networks. We focus our venue acquisition strategy on locations with a common profilelarge
venues with significant population densityas these venues face challenges that we are uniquely qualified to solve. We also plan to enter into new roaming agreements with network operators
to maximize the reach of our aggregated network, which creates a more attractive offering for our wholesale enterprise, multifamily, military, and retail customers. 
Leverage our neutral-host business model to grow DAS, small cell, and wholesale roaming
partnerships. Our neutral-host model enables us to effectively partner with venues because we ensure all customers receive
high-quality wireless service. We successfully balance the interests of individual carriers with the goals of our venue partners and build flexible DAS network architectures that can support multiple
carriers and the latest mobile services. We are also beginning to deploy small cell networks, and we believe this technology will enable us to expand into certain venues where a traditional DAS
network is cost-prohibitive. 
 Expand our carrier offload relationships.  As cellular networks become
strained due to capacity, carriers are beginning to offload their licensed mobile traffic onto unlicensed spectrum. We are highly focused on partnering with all four Tier 1 carriers in the U.S.
and other carriers around the world to offload their mobile traffic onto our Wi-Fi networks. 
 Increase our brand awareness.  We intend to continue to seek new ways to
promote our brand through our managed and operated hotspots. We plan to enhance our brand through low-cost co-marketing arrangements with our partners and through periodic promotional and sponsorship
activities and by continuing to leverage the reach of social media and public relations to interact with our customers.

Services 

         Our solution makes it easy, convenient and cost effective for consumers to access the mobile Internet. 
         DAS or Small Cell.    We offer our telecom operator partners access to our DAS or small cell networks at our managed and operated locations. We deploy our DAS or small cell networks within venues that require additional signal strength to improve the quality of cellular services. 
  Military/Multifamily.    We provide high-speed Wi-Fi services for residential consumers on military bases and at multifamily properties. On military bases, where we are the leading provider of barracks Wi-Fi services at more than 60 U.S. Army, Air Force, and Marines bases, we offer direct-to-consumer transactional and recurring monthly subscription plans. Our plan offerings include Basic Internet (speeds up to 10Mbps) and Blazing Internet (speeds up to 50Mbps). Our subscription plans require no installation or equipment and are portable from base to base, enabling a user to sign up for service immediately and remain a customer even if they are deployed to a new base. At multifamily properties, we primarily offer bulk subscription plans sold directly to the property owner. Our multifamily footprint includes 225 properties throughout the U.S. 
  WholesaleWi-Fi.    Our integrated hardware and software platform allows us to provide a range of enhanced services to network operators, device manufacturers, technology companies, enterprise software and services companies, venue operators and financial services companies. 
 

 Carrier offload services.  We offer services to carriers to move traffic
from their licensed cellular networks onto our Wi-Fi networks. 
 Comes with Boingo.  We offer access to our entire network of over
1.2 million hotspot locations to financial institutions and other enterprise customers who then offer them as a loyalty incentive to their customers. 
 Wi-Fi roaming and software services.  We offer roaming services across our
entire network of over 1.2 million hotspot locations to our partners who can then provide mobile Internet services to their customers at these locations. Our software solution, which provides
one-click access to our global footprint of hotspots, has been rebranded for wholesale partners, in addition to being marketed under the Boingo brand. In combination with our back-end system
infrastructure, it creates a global roaming solution for operators, carriers, other service providers and other businesses. 
 Turn-key solutions.  We offer our venue partners the ability to implement a
turn-key Wi-Fi solution through a Wi-Fi network infrastructure that we install, manage and operate. Our turn-key solutions include a variety of service models that are supported through a mix of
wholesale Wi-Fi, military, retail, and advertising revenue. 

  Retail.    We enable individuals to purchase Internet access at our managed and operated hotspots and select partner locations around the world. We offer a selection of recurring monthly subscriptions and single-use access plans. Our most common plan is the $14.99 monthly subscription for up to four connected devices that provide users access to a global footprint of over 1.2 million hotspots, and the single-use plan at $7.95 per day or $4.95 per hour. Our single-use access plans provide unlimited access on a single device at a specific hotspot for a defined period of time, tolled from the time the user first logs on to the network. We intend to continue to launch other flexible plans to meet the evolving needs of our customers and venues. 
  Advertising.    Our Wi-Fi platform provides a valuable opportunity for advertisers to reach consumers with sponsored Wi-Fi access, promotional programs and display advertising. We provide brands and advertisers the opportunity to sponsor wireless connectivity to individuals at locations where 
 5

   we manage and operate the Wi-Fi network and locations where we solely provide authorized access to a partner's Wi-Fi network through sponsored access and promotional programs. In addition, our advertising solution is easily integrated into Wi-Fi networks not directly managed by Boingo. 
 


Our Network 

         Over the past 17 years, we've built a global network of wireless networks that we estimate reaches more than a billion consumers annually. We operate 58 DAS networks containing 29,900 DAS nodes, and believe we are the largest operator of indoor DAS networks in the world. Our Wi-Fi networkwhich includes our managed and operated locations and our roaming networksincludes over 1.2 million commercial Wi-Fi hotspots in more than 100 countries around the world.

        We also operate Wi-Fi networks at over 60 U.S. Army, Air Force, and Marine bases around the world and 225 multi-dwelling properties including student housing, condominiums, apartments, senior living, and hospitality properties throughout the U.S. 
 


Marketing and Business Development 

         Our marketing and business development efforts are designed to cost effectively expand our footprint of venues where we can deploy DAS, Wi-Fi and small cell networks, secure more carrier contracts, attract and retain new multifamily, military and retail customers, and identify business partners that could leverage our network to provide mobile Internet services to their customers. We focus on efficient customer acquisition through our online presence, social media, public relations, influencer marketing, experiential and event marketing, market research, and other promotional activities. 
         We seek to maximize customer lifetime value by managing subscriber acquisition cost, extending customer life and determining appropriate pricing. We use information about subscriber behavior to help us retain customers and determine premium offerings. Our segmentation is focused at the product level, so that we provide the right product, plan and price for our military and retail customers. Our consumer plans are available for essentially all Wi-Fi enabled devices and are priced on a month-to-month or per-use basis. 
         We issue regular press releases announcing important partnerships and product developments and continually update our website with information about our network and services. We leverage our social media accounts, website and blog to further promote Boingo's product availability and applicability for property owners, military personnel, travelers, digital elite and consumers on-the-go. Our executive team speaks at industry events, trade shows and conferences.

Development 

         Our development efforts are focused primarily on supporting our networks and the businesses that run across these networks. These efforts include developing web applications for ease of connecting to our managed and operated locations and aggregate partner networks, integrating our software client with our wholesale partners, continuing to adapt our technology to new operating systems and platforms, continuing to develop an advertising system and business and operations support system for monetizing network service, continuing to develop a platform for delivering television services to our military bases and optimizing our networks and backend systems for roaming and carrier offload. Our development model is based on Agile development practices so any deviations can be promptly corrected to improve reliability in our network or services and enhance customer satisfaction. 
 


Technology 

         Over the past 17 years, we have developed proprietary systems that include the Boingo software client and software development kit ("SDK"); authentication, authorization and tracking systems; mediation and billing systems; television management and delivery platform; free user monetization media and advertising platform; and a real-time operational support and software configuration and messaging infrastructure. 
 


Boingo Software Client and SDK 

         The Boingo software client and SDK are installed on Wi-Fi enabled devices such as smartphones, laptops and tablets to enable our customers and our partners' customers to access our network. The key features of the Boingo software client include: 
 

 Simple user interface.  The Boingo software client provides individuals with
an uncomplicated, user-friendly interface designed to streamline the Wi-Fi network connection process. The software finds hotspots and monitors the availability of Wi-Fi hotspots in the Boingo
network, presents a notification message of the hotspot identified and allows one-click user connections. In some devices, connection to a Boingo Wi-Fi hotspot occurs in the background, providing the
user with a seamless, notification-free connectivity experience. 
 Support for all major operating system platforms.  The Boingo software
client and SDK support the Android, iOS, Mac OS and Windows operating systems, which represents the majority of all devices connecting to our managed and operated venues. 
 Automatic updates.  The Boingo software client automatically receives
identification information for new hotspot locations as they are added to the Boingo network, including any information needed to automatically identify and login to the network. Location information,
allowing a user to find Boingo hotspots from the client, is also automatically updated. On all but embedded platforms, software updates are also automatically offered to a user when available. 
 Custom branding and flexible integration alternatives.  We offer wholesale
customers the ability to integrate the Boingo software client into their products and services as a SDK. Additionally, we offer wholesale customers the option to utilize a custom, rebranded reference
design of the software client used in our retail customer offering. 




Authentication, Authorization and Tracking System 

         Our proprietary authentication, authorization and tracking system enables the reliable, scalable and secure initiation and termination of user Wi-Fi sessions on our network. This system authenticates our network users across a wide variety of hotspots and network operators, through a normalized authentication protocol. Through the authorization process, custom business rules ensure user access based on specific service parameters such as location, type of device, service plan and account 
 7

   information. Our system also captures duration, data traffic, location, and type of device. We normalize and process this data from disparate providers for our use and for our wholesale partners. This system has been enhanced to include support for secure Next Generation Hotspot roaming, which leverages Passpoint-certified devices and network hardware to establish seamless secure connections for customers. 
 


Mediation and Billing System 

         Our mediation and billing system record and analyzes individual usage sessions required to bill for Wi-Fi usage. Users are charged based on variables such as pricing plan, device type, location, time and amount of use. Our system consolidates usage session information, determines the user identity and applies the appropriate aggregation and flagging to ensure proper usage processing. Our system handles exceptions automatically. Exceptions that cannot be solved automatically are brought to the attention of the operations staff for rectification of any discrepancies. The billing system provides billing based on roaming relationship, user type, device type and account type. Our military and retail customer mediation and billing are handled by the same infrastructure used for wholesale customer and billing, resulting in efficiencies of scale and operation. 
 


Television Management and Delivery Platform 

         Our television system enables us to deliver content to our military subscribers. The Boingo digital rights management ("DRM") system allows for live linear commercial content to be delivered securely through our encrypted network links that connect our primary data center and the military bases. The central content management system allows for regional content delivery and multiple programming bundle offers. To enhance the viewing experience for mobile and tablet devices, the Boingo delivery system uses HTTP Live Streaming distribution protocol that will accommodate playing content at different network speeds by dynamically reducing content size. 
 


Free User Monetization Media and Advertising Platform 

         The Boingo Media platform enables brand advertisers to reach a captive audience through high engagement Wi-Fi sponsorships in premium locations worldwide. It delivers engaging advertising experiences, and our partners can place their messaging in the right context to their target audience. It also allows a combination of branding with direct response in a single high-impact format. Frequent travelers can be reached in a way they appreciateby receiving free Wi-Fi access when they need it most. 
 


Software Configuration and Messaging System 

         Our software configuration system provides real-time network configuration updates for thousands of networks and many detection and login methodologies used by the Boingo software client to access our network. Our software configuration system automatically registers new network definitions and login methodologies to allow individuals to connect to our hotspot locations. All supported platforms use a single configuration, providing a high level of operational and test efficiency. Our messaging system enables real-time customer notification and system interaction at login, based on location, network, user, account type, device and usage. This approach enables us and our partners to deliver custom marketing or service messages. 
 


Operations 

         We provide significant operational support for our managed and operated wireless infrastructure and the related technical systems in our network. For our managed and operated networks, we design, build, monitor and maintain the network. For roaming partners, we monitor network and related 
 8

   system uptime and report issues so that they can be quickly remedied. We have service level agreements with our roaming partners specifying minimum network uptime requirements and specified quality of service levels for different services that run across the wireless network infrastructure. 
         Our Wi-Fi deployments are based on the IEEE 802.11a, b, g, n and ac standards and operate in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum bands. We design, build, and operate DAS and small cell networks that currently provide 2G, 3G, and 4G-LTE services and expect to start deploying 5G across multiple licensed-frequency bands for all major telecom operators. 
 


Customers 

         We generate revenue primarily from our wholesale partners (including DAS customers), multifamily, military and retail customers. Our DAS customers are telecom operators who pay us one-time build-out fees and recurring access fees for our DAS network, enabling their cellular customers to access these networks. Our wholesale Wi-Fi customers pay usage-based network access fees to allow their customers access to our global Wi-Fi network and other wholesale Wi-Fi partners pay us to provide Wi-Fi services in their venue locations under a service provider arrangement. Our multifamily customers are property owners who pay us to provide Wi-Fi services including network installation services, and to provide support to their residents and employees at their properties. Our wholesale customer relationships are generally governed by multi-year contracts. We acquire our wholesale customers through our business development efforts. Our military and retail customers either purchase month-to-month subscription plans that automatically renew, or single-use access to our network. We acquire our military and retail customers primarily from users passing through our managed and operated locations, where we generally have exclusive multi-year agreements. We also generate revenue from advertisers that seek to reach visitors seeking Wi-Fi access at our managed and operated network locations with online advertising, promotional and sponsored programs. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, entities affiliated with Sprint Corporation accounted for 14%, 11% and 11%, respectively, of total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, entities affiliated with T-Mobile USA, Inc. accounted for 12% and 11%, respectively, of total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, entities affiliated with Verizon Communications Inc. accounted for 11% and 11%, respectively, of total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, entities affiliated with AT&T Inc. accounted for 11% and 12%, respectively, of total revenue. The loss of these groups and the customers could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations. 
 


Key Business Metrics 

         In addition to monitoring traditional financial measures, we also monitor our operating performance using key performance indicators. Our key performance indicators follow: 

   
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 2016 
 | (in thousands) | 
DAS nodes | | 29.9 | | 23.5 | 19.2 
Subscribersmilitary | | 138 | | 130 | 107 
Subscribersretail | | 122 | | 188 | 195 
Connects | | 277,744 | | 223,960 | 142,802


 DAS nodes.    This metric represents the number of active DAS nodes as of the end of the period. A DAS node is a single communications endpoint, typically an antenna, which transmits or receives radio frequency signals wirelessly. This measure is an indicator of the reach of our DAS network. 
 9

    Subscribersmilitary and  Subscribersretail.    These metrics represent the number of paying customers who are on a month-to-month subscription plan at a given period end. 
         Connects.    This metric shows how often individuals connect to our global Wi-Fi network in a given period. The connects include wholesale and retail customers in both customer pay locations and customer free locations where we are a paid service provider or receive sponsorship or promotion fees. We count each connect as a single connect regardless of how many times that individual accesses the network at a given venue during their 24-hour period. This measure is an indicator of paid activity throughout our network. 
 


Customer Support 

         We provide support services to our multifamily, military, retail, and enterprise customers 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year. Support is available by phone, chat, email, or social media channels like Twitter and Facebook. Our website contains a comprehensive knowledge base that includes answers to frequently asked questions for self-help, and we provide video support on our YouTube channel. Tier 1 support is provided by a third-party provider, while Tier 2 and social media support is managed by our internal customer care team. 
 


Competition 

         The market for mobile Internet services and solutions is fragmented and competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry include the following:
 

 price; 
 quality of service; 
 venue exclusivity; 
 ease of access and use; 
 bundled service offerings; 
 geographic reach; and 
 brand name recognition. 

         Direct and indirect competitors include telecom operators, cable companies, self-managed venue networks and smaller wireless Internet service providers. Some of these competitors have substantially greater resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. They may offer bundled data services with primary service offerings that we do not generally offer such as landline and cellular telephone service, and cable or satellite television. Many of our competitors are also partners from whom we receive revenue when their customers access our network. 
         We believe that we compete favorably based on our ability to deliver end-to-end solutions, our neutral host business model, deep domain experience in licensed and unlicensed spectrum technology, brand recognition, geographic coverage, network reliability, quality of service, ease of use, and cost. 
 


Intellectual Property 

         Our ongoing success will depend in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual restrictions. 
         We have eight issued U.S. patents, which expire between in 2022 and 2034. We have two patent applications pending in the United States and one patent application pending in Europe. We have two 
 10

   issued Japanese patents and two issued Chinese patents, each of which has a maximum term that expires in 2027. 
         Our registered trademarks in the United States and the European Union include "Boingo" and "Boingo Wi-Finder", and in the United States, "Boingo Broadband", "Cloudnine 9 Media", and "AWG-WIFI". We own additional registrations and have filed other trademark applications in the United States and other countries. 
         In addition to the foregoing protections, we control access to, and use of, our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners. Our software is protected by United States and international copyright laws. 
 


Employees 

         As of December 31, 2018, we had 463 employees, including 204 in operations, 118 in development and technology, 85 in sales and marketing and 56 in general and administrative. All of our employees are full-time employees except for three part-time employees. We have ten international employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced any employment related work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good. As of December 31, 2018, we also had arrangements with third-party call center providers that provided us with 58 full-time equivalent contractors for multifamily, military, retail and enterprise customer support service and similar functions. 
 


Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability 

         We understand that long-term value creation for shareholders is our core responsibility. We also have an important role to play for our team members, our customers, and the communities we serve and believe that enriching and enabling the lives of our employees and their families, supporting our environment, caring for our communities, and being good corporate stewards over Boingo is fundamental to our culture, and is just plain good business. 
 


Employee Well-Being 

 Financial well-being.  We offer an incredible benefits package that includes
equity, competitive pay, a quarterly or annual incentive plan, and a defined contribution savings plan with an employer match, among other health-related and other benefits. 
 Retirement planning.  To help prepare our employees for retirement, our
defined contribution savings plan is opt-out, so employees are automatically enrolled in the program when they are hired, unless they actively decline. This behavioral approach means that a
significant majority of all of our employees are actively saving for retirement and receiving a company match that is paid each pay period. 
 Financial literacy.  We conduct financial literacy trainings throughout the
year. Seminars have included retirement planning, managing student loan debt, and first-time homebuyer education. Our equity and defined contribution savings plan partners also offer monthly webinars,
online planning tools and one-on-one consultations. 
 Matching grant program.  Our Matching Grant Program amplifies employees'
cash contributions to the charitable organization of their choice. 
 Tomorrow's workforce.  We work with community organizations to help develop
the tech pipeline talent. Organizations we actively support include the Bixel Exchange Tech Talent Pipeline,

Expectations, Girls Who Code, Kid City/Urban Foundation, Los Angeles, and Path Forward. 


         We have been named one of the Best Places to Work in Los Angelesfour years running. Our high scores in corporate culture, leadership, and training and development reflect our commitment to create a great work environment for our employees. 
 


Environment 

 Going green.  We continually strive to improve operations and minimize our
impact on the environment. Business Intelligence Group ("BIG") recently named Boingo "Green Company of the Year" in their "BIG Awards for Business." 
 Certifications.  We are certified by the City of Los Angeles as a Green
Business, meeting sustainability standards set by the City of Los Angeles and the California Green Business Network. The certification was based on a proprietary scoring system used to measure a
company's achievements. We were selected for offering e-cycling programs, investing in sustainable business practices, and offering a transportation reimbursement program that rewards employees for
going green. 




Diversity 

 A culture of inclusion and programs.  At Boingo, we believe that fostering a
diverse and inclusive culture where all employees can succeed is important to our business. We participate in the Digital Diversity Networks' Innovation and Inclusion Awards and we are a two-time
winner. We are a founding member of LightReading's Women in Comms, a platform that empowers women to champion change and redress the gender imbalance in the workplace. We host Center for Excellence in
Engineering and Diversity programs that help educationally underrepresented students achieve success in math, science and engineering. Women of Boingo is an employee club that celebrates diverse
talents and is dedicated to empowering women to follow a fulfilling career through education, networking and mentoring opportunities. 




Governance 

 Good governance.  We endeavor to improve corporate governance and executive
compensation and practices and have recently implemented various changes to our corporate governance practices. 
 Adopted stock ownership guidelines.  We adopted stock ownership guidelines
to reinforce our belief that executives who believe in the future of the Company should have meaningful equity holdings in Boingo. 
 Adopted majority voting standard in uncontested elections.  We have
implemented a majority voting standard in uncontested elections of director. We have also implemented a majority voting policy for director resignations, applicable if an incumbent director nominee
receives less than a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election. 
 Declassified Board.  Commencing with the 2018 annual meeting of
stockholders, director nominees are reelected for a term of one year, but directors elected prior to the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders will continue to serve the remainder of their terms.
Therefore, at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, all directors who are elected will be elected for a one-year term.
