The Southern Company System
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
The traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities that own generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional information on the traditional electric operating companies' generating facilities. Each company's transmission facilities are connected to the respective company's own generating plants and other sources of power (including certain generating plants owned by Southern Power) and are interconnected with the transmission facilities of the other traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. For information on the State of Georgia's integrated transmission system, see "Territory Served by the Southern Company System – Traditional Electric Operating Companies and Southern Power" herein.
Agreements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity and energy transactions that may be entered into from time to time for reasons related to reliability or economics. Additionally, the traditional electric operating companies have entered into voluntary reliability agreements with the subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation, Florida Electric Power Coordinating Group, and Tennessee Valley Authority and with Duke Energy Progress, LLC, Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company, and Virginia Electric and Power Company, each of which provides for the establishment and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of generation and transmission facilities, maintenance schedules, load retention programs, emergency operations, and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power supply. The traditional electric operating companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast (including some of those referred to above) to form the SERC to augment further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the traditional electric operating companies are represented on the National Electric Reliability Council.
The utility assets of the traditional electric operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power Company are operated as a single integrated electric system, or power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company. The fundamental purpose of the power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the electric facilities in an effort to achieve the maximum possible economies consistent with the highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service requirements and other operating limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional electric operating company and Southern Power Company retains its lowest cost energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess energy to the power pool for use in serving customers of other traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power Company or for sale by the power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations thereunder, as well as the proportionate sharing of costs and revenues resulting from power pool transactions with third parties.
Southern Power and Southern Linc have secured from the traditional electric operating companies certain services which are furnished at cost in compliance with FERC regulations.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power each have agreements with Southern Nuclear to operate the Southern Company system's existing nuclear plants, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. In addition, Georgia Power has an agreement with Southern Nuclear to develop, license, construct, and operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See "Regulation – Nuclear Regulation" herein for additional information.

Southern Power
Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy facilities, and sells electricity at market-based rates (under authority from the FERC) in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions and sales of assets, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. Southern Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional electric operating companies, but the majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. For additional information on Southern Power's business activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – OVERVIEW – "Business Activities" of Southern Power in Item 7 herein.
Southern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the power pool, and has various subsidiaries, which were created to own and operate natural gas and renewable generation facilities either wholly or in partnership with various third parties. As of December 31, 2017, Southern Power's generation fleet totaled 12,940 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including 5,152 MWs owned by its subsidiaries). In addition, Southern Power Company has other subsidiaries that are pursuing additional natural gas generation and other development opportunities. The generation assets of Southern Power Company's subsidiaries are not included in the power pool. 
Some of Southern Power's partnerships allow for the sharing of cash distributions and tax benefits at differing percentages. Southern Power is entitled to 51% of all cash distributions from eight of the partnership entities and the respective partner who holds the class B membership interests is entitled to 49% of all cash distributions. For the Desert Stateline partnership, Southern Power is entitled to 66% of all cash distributions and the class B member is entitled to 34% of all cash distributions. In addition, Southern Power is entitled to substantially all of the federal tax benefits with respect to these nine partnership entities.
In September 2017, Southern Power began a legal entity reorganization of various direct and indirect subsidiaries that own and operate substantially all of the solar facilities, including certain subsidiaries owned in partnership with various third parties. The reorganization is expected to be substantially completed in the first quarter 2018. Southern Power is pursuing the sale of a 33% equity interest in the newly-formed holding company owning these solar assets, which, if successful, is expected to close in the middle of 2018. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein, Note 11 to the financial statements of Southern Power in Item 8 herein, and Note 12 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Southern Power" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, construction, and development projects. 
Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective generation facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction or being acquired) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of the PPAs and investments associated with the wind and natural-gas fired facilities currently under construction and the Gaskell West 1 solar project, which was acquired subsequent to December 31, 2017, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power has an average investment coverage ratio of 91% through 2022 and 89% through 2027, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 15 years. 
Southern Power's natural gas and biomass sales are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on investment.
Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold

                                    Index to Financial Statements

to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.

See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Power Sales Agreements" and "Acquisitions" of Southern Power in Item 7 herein and Note 11 to the financial statements of Southern Power in Item 8 herein for additional information.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 11.3% of Southern Power's revenues were derived from Georgia Power. Southern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues attributable to one customer may be replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings.
Southern Company Gas
Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas, including gas marketing services, wholesale gas services, and gas midstream operations.

These efforts to invest in and develop new business opportunities may offer potential returns exceeding those of rate-regulated operations. However, these activities often involve a higher degree of risk.
Construction Programs
The subsidiary companies of Southern Company are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. For estimated construction and environmental expenditures for the periods 2018 through 2022, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" of Southern Company, each traditional electric operating company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas in Item 7 herein. The Southern Company system's construction program consists of capital investment and capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. The traditional electric operating companies also anticipate expenditures associated with ash pond closure and ground water monitoring under the Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities rule (CCR Rule), which are reflected in the Southern Company system's asset retirement obligation liabilities. In 2018, the construction program is expected to be apportioned approximately as follows:

"The Southern Company System – Southern Company Gas" herein for additional information regarding agreements entered into by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company Gas to sell two of its natural gas distribution utilities. Projected capital expenditures of $0.1 billion related to these two natural gas distribution utilities are excluded from the amounts above.
The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to the environmental rules; changes in electric generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. Additionally, planned expenditures for plant acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy.
In addition, the construction program includes the development and construction of new electric generating facilities with designs that have not been previously constructed, which may result in revised estimates during construction. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Georgia Power under "Nuclear Construction" and "Retail Regulatory Matters – Nuclear Construction," respectively, in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Georgia Power's construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Financing Programs
See each of the registrant's MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY in Item 7 herein and Note 6 to the financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 herein for information concerning financing programs.
Fuel Supply
Electric
The traditional electric operating companies' and SEGCO's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas and coal. Southern Power's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – RESULTS OF OPERATION – "Electricity Business – Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" of Southern Company and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – RESULTS OF OPERATION – "Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" of each traditional electric operating company in Item 7 herein for information regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net KWH generated for the years 2015 through 2017.
The traditional electric operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive substantially all of their 2018 coal burn requirements. These agreements have terms ranging between one and four years. In 2017, the weighted average sulfur content of all coal burned by the traditional electric operating companies was 1.12%. This sulfur level, along with banked and purchased sulfur dioxide allowances, allowed the traditional electric operating companies to remain within limits set by Phase I of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) under the Clean Air Act. In 2017, the Southern Company system did not purchase any sulfur dioxide allowances, annual nitrogen oxide emission allowances, or seasonal nitrogen oxide emission allowances from the market. As any additional environmental regulations are proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the traditional electric operating companies' fuel mix will be monitored to help ensure that the traditional electric operating companies remain in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to evaluate the need to purchase additional emissions allowances, the timing of capital expenditures for emissions control equipment, and potential unit retirements and replacements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" of Southern Company, each traditional electric operating company, and Southern Power in Item 7 herein for additional information on environmental matters.
SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company, has agreements in place for the natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For 2018, SCS has contracted for 510 Bcf of natural gas supply under agreements with remaining terms up to 15 years. In addition to natural gas supply, SCS has contracts in place 
I-9

                                    Index to Financial Statements

for both firm natural gas transportation and storage. Management believes these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation, and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system's natural gas generating units.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have multiple contracts covering their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication. The uranium, conversion services, and fuel fabrication contracts are for terms of less than 10 years with varying expiration dates. The term lengths for the enrichment services contracts are for less than 15 years with varying expiration dates. Management believes suppliers have sufficient nuclear fuel production capability to permit the normal operation of the Southern Company system's nuclear generating units.
Changes in fuel prices to the traditional electric operating companies are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See "Rate Matters – Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans" herein for additional information. Southern Power's natural gas and biomass PPAs generally provide that the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power have pursued and are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power under "Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Natural Gas 
Recent advances in natural gas drilling in shale producing regions of the United States have resulted in historically high supplies of natural gas and relatively low prices for natural gas. Procurement plans for natural gas supply and transportation to serve regulated utility customers are reviewed and approved by the state regulatory agencies in which Southern Company Gas operates. Southern Company Gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and from its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sequent Energy Management, L.P., under asset management agreements in states where such agreements are approved by the applicable state regulatory agency. Southern Company Gas also contracts for transportation and storage services from interstate pipelines that are regulated by the FERC. When firm pipeline services are temporarily not needed, Southern Company Gas may release the services in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions or utilize asset management arrangements, thereby reducing the net cost of natural gas charged to customers for most of the natural gas distribution utilities. Peak-use requirements are met through utilization of company-owned storage facilities, pipeline transportation capacity, purchased storage services, peaking facilities, and other supply sources, arranged by either transportation customers or Southern Company Gas.

As of December 31, 2017, PowerSouth owned generating units with approximately 2,100 MWs of nameplate capacity, including an undivided 8.16% ownership interest in Alabama Power's Plant Miller Units 1 and 2. PowerSouth's facilities were financed with RUS loans secured by long-term contracts requiring distributing cooperatives to take their requirements from PowerSouth to the extent such energy is available. See PROPERTIES – "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for details of Alabama Power's joint-ownership with PowerSouth of a portion of Plant Miller. Alabama Power has a system supply agreement with PowerSouth to provide 200 MWs of capacity service through December 31, 2030 with an option to extend and renegotiate in the event Alabama Power builds new generation or contracts for new capacity.
Alabama Power and Gulf Power have entered into separate agreements with PowerSouth involving interconnection between their respective systems. The delivery of capacity and energy from PowerSouth to certain distributing cooperatives in the service territories of Alabama Power and Gulf Power is governed by the Southern Company/PowerSouth Network Transmission Service Agreement. The rates for this service to PowerSouth are on file with the FERC.
OPC is an EMC owned by its 38 retail electric distribution cooperatives, which provide retail electric service to customers in Georgia. OPC provides wholesale electric power to its members through its generation assets and power purchased from other suppliers.
Four electric cooperative associations, financed by the RUS, operate within Gulf Power's service territory. These cooperatives purchase their full requirements from PowerSouth and SEPA (a federal power marketing agency). A non-affiliated utility also operates within Gulf Power's service territory and purchases its full requirements from Gulf Power.
Mississippi Power has an interchange agreement with Cooperative Energy, a generating and transmitting cooperative, pursuant to which various services are provided.
As of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 72 municipally-owned electric distribution systems operating in the territory in which the traditional electric operating companies provide electric service at retail or wholesale.
As of December 31, 2017, 48 municipally-owned electric distribution systems and one county-owned system received their requirements through MEAG Power, which was established by a Georgia state statute in 1975. MEAG Power serves these requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are jointly-owned with Georgia Power, and purchases from other resources. MEAG Power also has a pseudo scheduling and services agreement with Georgia Power. Dalton serves its requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are jointly-owned with Georgia Power, and through purchases from Georgia Power and Southern Power through a service agreement. See PROPERTIES – "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information.
Georgia Power has entered into substantially similar agreements with Georgia Transmission Corporation, MEAG Power, and Dalton providing for the establishment of an integrated transmission system to carry the power and energy of all parties. The agreements require an investment by each party in the integrated transmission system in proportion to its respective share of the aggregate system load. See PROPERTIES – "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information.
I-11

                                    Index to Financial Statements

Southern Power assumed or entered into PPAs with some of the traditional electric operating companies, investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. See "The Southern Company System – Southern Power" above and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Power Sales Agreements" of Southern Power in Item 7 herein for additional information concerning Southern Power's PPAs.

Competition
Electric 
The electric utility industry in the U.S. is continuing to evolve as a result of regulatory and competitive factors. Among the early primary agents of change was the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which allowed IPPs to access a utility's transmission network in order to sell electricity to other utilities.
The competition for retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by various factors, including price, availability, technological advancements, service, and reliability. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences, regulatory, political, and environmental considerations, taxation, and supply.
The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia are regulated by the Territorial Electric Service Act of 1973. Pursuant to the provisions of this Act, all areas within existing municipal limits were assigned to the primary electric supplier therein. Areas outside of such municipal limits were either to be assigned or to be declared open for customer choice of supplier by action of the Georgia PSC pursuant to standards set forth in this Act. Consistent with such standards, the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a supplier. Notwithstanding such assignments, this Act provides that any new customer locating outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a connected load of at least 900 KWs may exercise a one-time choice for the life of the premises to receive electric service from the supplier of its choice.
Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued "Grandfather Certificates" of public convenience and necessity to Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural cooperatives operating in southeastern Mississippi, then served in whole or in part by Mississippi Power, authorizing them to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of the state. The six cooperatives serve approximately 325,000 retail customers in a certificated area of approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas included in a "Grandfather Certificate," the utility holding such certificate may extend or maintain its electric 
I-12

                                    Index to Financial Statements

system subject to certain regulatory approvals; extensions of facilities by such utility, or extensions of facilities into that area by other utilities, may not be made except upon a showing of, and a grant of a certificate of, public convenience and necessity. Areas included in such a certificate that are subsequently annexed to municipalities may continue to be served by the holder of the certificate, irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing municipality. On the other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into such newly annexed area without authorization by the Mississippi PSC.
Generally, the traditional electric operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition in their respective retail service territories in varying degrees from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources such as self-generation (as described below) and distributed generation technologies, as well as other factors.
Southern Power competes with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, and others for wholesale energy sales across various U.S. utility markets. The needs of these markets are driven by the demands of end users and the generation available. Southern Power's success in wholesale energy sales is influenced by various factors including reliability and availability of Southern Power's plants, availability of transmission to serve the demand, price, and Southern Power's ability to contain costs.
As of December 31, 2017, Alabama Power had cogeneration contracts in effect with eight industrial customers. Under the terms of these contracts, Alabama Power purchases excess energy generated by such companies. During 2017, Alabama Power purchased approximately 98 million KWHs from such companies at a cost of $3 million.
As of December 31, 2017, Georgia Power had contracts in effect with 27 small power producers whereby Georgia Power purchases their excess generation. During 2017, Georgia Power purchased 1.6 billion KWHs from such companies at a cost of $114 million. Georgia Power also has PPAs for electricity with four cogeneration facilities. Payments are subject to reductions for failure to meet minimum capacity output. During 2017, Georgia Power purchased 26 million KWHs at a cost of $0.7 million from these facilities.
Also during 2017, Georgia Power purchased energy from three customer-owned generating facilities. These customers provide only energy to Georgia Power, make no capacity commitment, and are not dispatched by Georgia Power. During 2017, Georgia Power purchased a total of 317 million KWHs from the three customers at a cost of approximately $25 million.
As of December 31, 2017, Gulf Power had agreements in effect with various industrial, commercial, and qualifying facilities pursuant to which Gulf Power purchases "as available" energy from customer-owned generation. During 2017, Gulf Power purchased 277 million KWHs from such companies for approximately $7 million.
As of December 31, 2017, Mississippi Power had a cogeneration agreement in effect with one of its industrial customers. Under the terms of this contract, Mississippi Power purchases any excess generation. During 2017, Mississippi Power did not purchase any excess generation from this customer.
Natural Gas 
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities do not compete with other distributors of natural gas in their exclusive franchise territories but face competition from other energy products. Their principal competitors are electric utilities and fuel oil and propane providers serving the residential, commercial, and industrial markets in their service areas for customers who are considering switching to or from a natural gas appliance. 
Competition for heating as well as general household and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer or builder makes decisions as to which types of equipment to install. Customers generally use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment. 
Customer demand for natural gas could be affected by numerous factors, including:

• | changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy;


• | general economic conditions;


• | energy conservation, including state-supported energy efficiency programs;


• | legislation and regulations;


• | the cost and capability to convert from natural gas to alternative energy products; and


• | technological changes resulting in displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances.

The natural gas-related programs generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and seek to expand the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. In addition, Southern Company Gas partners with third-party entities to market the benefits of natural gas appliances.
The availability and affordability of natural gas have provided cost advantages and further opportunity for growth of the businesses.

                                    Index to Financial Statements

Seasonality
The demand for electric power and natural gas supply is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. In most of the areas the traditional electric operating companies serve, electric power sales peak during the summer with a smaller peak during the winter, while in most of the areas Southern Company Gas serves, natural gas demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have historically sold less power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder.
Regulation
State Commissions
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective state PSCs or applicable state regulatory agencies. These regulatory bodies have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities operating in the respective states, including their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except for the Mississippi PSC), and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the Mississippi PSC, in part, retail service territories. See "Territory Served by the Southern Company System" and "Rate Matters" herein for additional information.
Federal Power Act
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries, and SEGCO are all public utilities engaged in wholesale sales of energy in interstate commerce and, therefore, are subject to the rate, financial, and accounting jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. The FERC must approve certain financings and allows an "at cost standard" for services rendered by system service companies such as SCS and Southern Nuclear. The FERC is also authorized to establish regional reliability organizations which enforce reliability standards, address impediments to the construction of transmission, and prohibit manipulative energy trading practices.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act or the earlier Federal Water Power Act applicable to licensees with respect to their hydroelectric developments. As of December 31, 2017, among the hydroelectric projects subject to licensing by the FERC are 14 existing Alabama Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1,670,000 KWs and 17 existing Georgia Power generating stations and one generating station partially owned by Georgia Power, with a combined aggregate installed capacity of 1,087,296 KWs.
In 2013, the FERC issued a new 30-year license to Alabama Power for Alabama Power's seven hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan, and Bouldin). Alabama Power filed a petition requesting rehearing of the FERC order granting the relicense seeking revisions to several conditions of the license. Alabama Rivers Alliance, American Rivers, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, and the Atlanta Regional Commission also filed petitions for rehearing of the FERC order. In April 2016, the FERC issued an order granting in part and denying in part Alabama Power's rehearing request. The order also denied all of the other rehearing requests. In May 2016, Alabama Rivers Alliance and American Rivers filed a second rehearing request and, in June 2016, also filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of the license and the rehearing denial order. The FERC issued an order in September 2016 denying the second rehearing request, and American Rivers and Alabama Rivers Alliance subsequently filed an appeal of that order at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit consolidated the two appeals into one proceeding.
In 2017, Alabama Power continued the process of developing an application to relicense the Harris Dam project on the Tallapoosa River, which is expected to be filed with the FERC by November 30, 2021. The current Harris Dam project license will expire on November 30, 2023.
In 2017, Georgia Power continued the process of developing an application to relicense the Wallace Dam project on the Oconee River. The current Wallace Dam project license will expire on June 1, 2020. Georgia Power's hydro electric licenses expiring in 2023 include the Lloyd Shoals project, the Riverview project, and the Langdale project. The FERC relicensing proceedings for these three projects are expected to begin in 2018.
Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2027, for the Rocky Mountain Plant, a pure pumped storage facility of 847,800 KW capacity. See PROPERTIES – "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information.
Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the years 2023-2066 in the case of Alabama Power's projects and in the years 2035-2044 in the case of Georgia Power's projects.
Upon or after the expiration of each license, the U.S. Government, by act of Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may relicense the project either to the original licensee or to a new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to another, 
I-14

                                    Index to Financial Statements

the original licensee is to be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such compensation to reflect the net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the fair value of the property, plus reasonable damages to other property of the licensee resulting from the severance therefrom of the property. The FERC may grant relicenses subject to certain requirements that could result in additional costs.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Nuclear Regulation
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Nuclear are subject to regulation by the NRC. The NRC is responsible for licensing and regulating nuclear facilities and materials and for conducting research in support of the licensing and regulatory process, as mandated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978, as amended; and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and other applicable statutes. These responsibilities also include protecting public health and safety, protecting the environment, protecting and safeguarding nuclear materials and nuclear power plants in the interest of national security, and assuring conformity with antitrust laws.
The NRC licenses for Georgia Power's Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 expire in 2034 and 2038, respectively. The NRC licenses for Alabama Power's Plant Farley Units 1 and 2 expire in 2037 and 2041, respectively. The NRC licenses for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 expire in 2047 and 2049, respectively.
In 2012, the NRC issued combined construction and operating licenses (COLs) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Receipt of the COLs allowed full construction to begin. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Retail Regulatory Matters – Nuclear Construction" of Georgia Power in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Nuclear Construction" and Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters – Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
See Notes 1 and 9 to the financial statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power in Item 8 herein for information on nuclear decommissioning costs and nuclear insurance.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
The Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Compliance with these existing environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions or through market-based contracts. There is no assurance, however, that all such costs will be recovered. For Southern Company Gas, substantially all of these costs are related to former manufactured gas plants sites, which are primarily recovered through existing ratemaking provisions. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company Gas under "Environmental Matters" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Compliance with federal environmental laws and resulting regulations has been, and will continue to be, a significant focus for Southern Company, each traditional electric operating company, Southern Power, SEGCO, and Southern Company Gas. New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of the traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and the natural gas distribution utilities' operations. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" of Southern Company and each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 7 herein for additional information about environmental issues, including, but not limited to, proposed and final regulations related to air quality, water quality, CCRs, and global climate issues. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" of Southern Power in Item 7 herein for additional information about environmental issues and global climate issues. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" of Southern Company Gas in Item 7 herein for additional information about environmental remediation liabilities.
The Southern Company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy, including potential electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions, and future environmental capital expenditures will depend on various factors, such as state-level adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed control technology, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges. Compliance costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, and adding or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the transmission system. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated. Such expenditures could affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered on a timely basis through regulated rates for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities or through long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. Further, higher costs that are recovered through regulated rates 
I-15

                                    Index to Financial Statements

could contribute to reduced demand for energy, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for electricity and natural gas. See "Construction Program" herein and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" of Southern Company, each of the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas in Item 7 herein for additional information. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Rate Matters
Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans
Electric
The rates and service regulations of the traditional electric operating companies are uniform for each class of service throughout their respective retail service territories. Rates for residential electric service are generally of the block type based upon KWHs used and include minimum charges. Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service are presently of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and minimum bill charges. These large customers' rates are generally based upon usage by the customer and include rates with special features to encourage off-peak usage. Additionally, Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power are generally allowed by their respective state PSCs to negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers. Such terms and cost of service, however, are subject to final state PSC approval.
The traditional electric operating companies recover certain costs through a variety of forward-looking, cost-based rate mechanisms. Fuel and net purchased energy costs are recovered through specific fuel cost recovery provisions. These fuel cost recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed or on schedules as required by the respective PSCs. Approved compliance, storm damage, and certain other costs are recovered at Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power through specific cost recovery mechanisms approved by their respective PSCs. Certain similar costs at Georgia Power are recovered through various base rate tariffs as approved by the Georgia PSC. Costs not recovered through specific cost recovery mechanisms are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power through annual, formulaic cost recovery proceedings and at Georgia Power and Gulf Power through periodic base rate proceedings.
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Regulatory Matters" of Southern Company and each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and each of the traditional electric operating companies under "Retail Regulatory Matters" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms. Also, see Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Company and each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 8 herein for a discussion of recovery of fuel costs, storm damage costs, and compliance costs through rate mechanisms.
See "Integrated Resource Planning" herein for a discussion of Georgia PSC certification of new demand-side or supply-side resources for Georgia Power. In addition, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Retail Regulatory Matters – Nuclear Construction" of Georgia Power in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Nuclear Construction" and Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters – Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act and the Georgia PSC certification of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which have allowed Georgia Power to recover financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 during the construction period beginning in 2011.
See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Mississippi Power under "Kemper County Energy Facility" in Item 8 herein and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Kemper County Energy Facility – Rate Recovery" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 herein for information on cost recovery plans with respect to the Kemper County energy facility.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries are authorized by the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "FERC Matters" of each of the registrants in Item 7 herein for information on the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power Company's market-based rate authority and pending FERC proceedings relating to this authority.
Mississippi Power serves long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 19.3% of Mississippi Power's operating revenues in 2017 and are largely subject to rolling 10-

year cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas' seven natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies with respect to rates charged to their customers, maintenance of accounting records, and various service and safety matters. Rates charged to these customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide each natural gas distribution utility the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt, and provide a reasonable return. Rate base generally consists of the original cost of the utility plant in service, working capital, and certain other assets, less accumulated depreciation on the utility plant in service and net deferred income tax liabilities, and may include certain other additions or deductions.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light Company, which operates in a deregulated environment in which gas marketers rather than a traditional utility sell natural gas to end-use customers and earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. 
The natural gas distribution utilities, excluding Atlanta Gas Light Company, are authorized to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that allow them to adjust their rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and to ensure they recover all of the costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for their customers. In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, the natural gas distribution utilities have other cost recovery mechanisms, such as regulatory riders, which vary by utility but allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation and energy efficiency plans. 
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Regulatory Matters – Utility Regulation and Rate Design" of Southern Company Gas in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company Gas under "Regulatory Matters" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms.
Integrated Resource Planning
Each of the traditional electric operating companies continually evaluates its electric generating resources in order to ensure that it maintains a cost-effective and reliable mix of resources to meet the existing and future demand requirements of its customers. See "Environmental Laws and Regulations" above for a discussion of existing and potential environmental regulations that may impact the future generating resource needs of the traditional electric operating companies.
Certain of the traditional electric operating companies are required to file IRPs with their respective state PSC as discussed below.
Georgia Power
Triennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to meet the future electric service needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC, under state law, must certify any new demand-side or supply-side resources for Georgia Power to receive cost recovery. Once certified, the lesser of actual or certified construction costs and purchased power costs is recoverable through rates. Certified costs may be excluded from recovery only on the basis of fraud, concealment, failure to disclose a material fact, imprudence, or criminal misconduct.
See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power – Rate Plans" and " – Integrated Resource Plan" and "Nuclear Construction" and Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate Plans," "– Integrated Resource Plan," and "– Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Gulf Power
Annually by April 1, Gulf Power must file a 10-year site plan with the Florida PSC containing Gulf Power's estimate of its power-generating needs in the period and the general location of its proposed power plant sites. The 10-year site plans submitted by the state's electric utilities are reviewed by the Florida PSC and subsequently classified as either "suitable" or "unsuitable." The Florida PSC then reports its findings along with any suggested revisions to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection for its consideration at any subsequent electrical power plant site certification proceedings. Under 
I-17

                                    Index to Financial Statements

Florida law, any 10-year site plans submitted by an electric utility are considered tentative information for planning purposes only and may be amended at any time at the discretion of the utility with written notification to the Florida PSC.
Gulf Power's most recent 10-year site plan was classified by the Florida PSC as "suitable" in November 2017. The plan identifies environmental regulations and potential legislation or regulation that would impose mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Air Quality," "– Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals," and "– Global Climate Issues" of Gulf Power in Item 7 herein.
As a result of the cost to comply with environmental regulations imposed by the EPA, Gulf Power retired its coal-fired generation at Plant Smith Units 1 and 2 (357 MWs) in March 2016. In August 2016, the Florida PSC approved Gulf Power's request to reclassify the remaining net book value of Plant Smith Units 1 and 2 and the remaining materials and supplies associated with these units as of the retirement date, totaling approximately $63 million, to a regulatory asset. Gulf Power began amortizing the investment balances over 15 years effective January 1, 2018 as determined in a rate case settlement agreement approved by the Florida PSC on April 4, 2017.
Mississippi Power 
Mississippi Power's 2010 IRP indicated that, among other things, Mississippi Power planned to construct the Kemper County energy facility as an IGCC to meet its identified needs, to add environmental controls at Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2, to defer environmental controls at Plant Watson Units 4 and 5, and to continue operation of the combined cycle Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Air Quality" and "– Global Climate Issues" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 herein. 
On February 6, 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved a settlement agreement related to cost recovery for the Kemper County energy facility, pursuant to which Mississippi Power agreed to file a Reserve Margin Plan (RMP) by August 2018. The RMP will include many of the same aspects of a traditional IRP, but the RMP will also contain alternatives proposed by Mississippi Power to address its current capacity which is in excess of Mississippi Power's long-term targeted reserve margin. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
For additional information regarding the Kemper County energy facility, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Kemper County Energy Facility" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Mississippi Power under "Kemper County Energy Facility" in Item 8 herein.
