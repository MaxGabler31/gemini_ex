CMS Energy and Consumers  The Triple Bottom Line
 
CMS Energy is an energy company operating primarily in Michigan. It is the parent holding company of several subsidiaries, including Consumers, an electric and gas utility, and CMS Enterprises, primarily a domestic independent power producer. Consumers electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity, and Consumers gas utility operations include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas. Consumers customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. CMS Enterprises, through its subsidiaries and equity investments, is engaged in domestic independent power production, the marketing of independent power production, and the development of renewable generation.
 
CMS Energy and Consumers manage their businesses by the nature of services each provides. CMS Energy operates principally in three business segments: electric utility; gas utility; and enterprises, its non-utility operations and investments. Consumers operates principally in two business segments: electric utility and gas utility. CMS Energys and Consumers businesses are affected primarily by:
 
·                 regulation and regulatory matters
 ·                 state and federal legislation
 ·                 economic conditions
 ·                 weather
 ·                 energy commodity prices
 ·                 interest rates
 ·                 their securities credit ratings

The Triple Bottom Line
 
CMS Energys and Consumers purpose is to achieve world class performance while delivering hometown service. In support of this purpose, the companies employ the Consumers Energy Way, a lean operating model designed to improve safety, quality, cost, delivery, and employee morale.
 
CMS Energy and Consumers measure their progress toward the purpose by considering their impact on the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit, which is underpinned by performance; this consideration takes into account not only the economic value that the companies create for customers and investors, but also their responsibility to social and environmental goals. The triple bottom line balances the interests of the companies employees, customers, suppliers, regulators, creditors, Michigans residents, the investment community, and other stakeholders, and it reflects the broader societal impacts of the companies activities.
 

Consumers 2017 Sustainability Report, which is available to the public, describes the companys commitment to world class performance and to the triple bottom line and discusses its progress in the areas of safety, environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and economic development.
 
People: The people element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energys and Consumers commitment to their employees, their customers, the residents of local communities in which the companies do business, and other stakeholders.
 
The safety of employees, customers, and the general public is a priority of CMS Energy and Consumers. Accordingly, CMS Energy and Consumers have worked to integrate a set of safety principles into their business operations and culture. These principles include complying with applicable safety, health, and security regulations and implementing programs and processes aimed at continually improving safety and security conditions. The number of recordable safety incidents in 2017 was 65, compared with 73 in 2016 and 106 in 2015. The number of recordable safety incidents in 2017 was the lowest in Consumers history, and Consumers is on track to have the best safety results of its EEI peer group, as it did in 2016.
 
CMS Energy and Consumers also place a high priority on customer value and on providing a hometown customer experience. Consumers customer-driven investment program is aimed at improving safety and increasing electric and gas reliability, which has resulted in measureable improvements in customer satisfaction.
 
Central to Consumers commitment to its customers are the initiatives it has undertaken to keep electricity and natural gas affordable. These initiatives include the adoption of its lean operating model that is focused on completing work safely and correctly the first time, thus minimizing rework and waste, while delivering services on time. Other cost-saving initiatives undertaken by Consumers include:
 
·                 replacement of coal-fueled generation with cleaner and more efficient gas-fueled generation, renewable energy, and energy waste reduction and demand response programs
 ·                 targeted infrastructure investment, including the installation of smart meters
 ·                 information and control system efficiencies
 ·                 employee and retiree health care cost sharing
 ·                 workforce productivity enhancements
 
16




In addition, Consumers gas commodity costs declined by 60 percent from 2007 through 2017, due not only to a decrease in market prices but also to Consumers improvements to its gas infrastructure and optimization of its gas purchasing and storage strategy. These gas commodity savings are passed on to customers.
 
Planet: The planet element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energys and Consumers commitment to protect the environment; this commitment extends beyond complying with the various state and federal environmental and health and safety laws and regulations to which CMS Energy and Consumers are subject. Consideration of climate change risk and other environmental risks is embedded in the companies strategy, business planning, and enterprise risk management processes.
 
CMS Energy and Consumers continue to focus on opportunities to reduce their carbon footprint by replacing coal-fueled generation with gas-fueled generation and renewable energy. In 2016, Consumers retired seven of its coal-fueled electric generating units, representing 33 percent of its owned coal-fueled generating capacity. As a result of these retirements and other actions taken by CMS Energy and Consumers, the companies combined percentage of electric supply (self-generated and purchased) from coal has decreased by 16 percentage points since 2015. Presented in the following illustration are CMS Energys, including Consumers, sources of electric supply during 2017:
 

Gas (38%) 
Coal (26%) 
Nuclear (17%) 
Renewables (9%) 
Pumped Storage (2%) 
Net interchange power and other (8%) 

 
Additionally, over the last 20 years, Consumers has reduced its sulfur dioxide emissions by 80 percent, its nitrogen oxide emissions by 90 percent, and its particulate matter emissions by 80 percent. Over the last ten years, Consumers has reduced its mercury emissions by 70 percent.
 
17




Going forward, Consumers will continue to invest in renewable generation and energy waste reduction programs in order to meet the requirements set by the 2016 Energy Law and to fulfill customer demand beyond the renewable energy standard. CMS Energy will continue to pursue further opportunities for the development of renewable generation projects through its non-utility businesses.
 
The 2016 Energy Law aligns with Consumers clean and lean strategy, which focuses on increasing its generation of renewable energy, helping its customers use less energy, and offering demand response programs to reduce demand during critical peak times. Among other things, the 2016 Energy Law:
 
·                 raised the renewable energy standard from the present ten-percent requirement to 12.5 percent by 2019 and 15 percent by 2021
 ·                 established a goal of 35 percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction by 2025
 ·                 authorized incentives for demand response programs and expanded existing incentives for energy efficiency programs, referring to the combined initiatives as energy waste reduction programs
 
In a further effort to advance its environmental stewardship and to meet the requirements of present and future regulations, Consumers has adopted the following voluntary goals for air emissions, water use, and waste reduction:
 
·                 Committed to a 20-percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions intensity (pounds of carbon dioxide per MWh generated) by 2025 from a 2008 baseline. In 2016, Consumers achieved a reduction in total tons of carbon dioxide emitted of over 30 percent compared to 2008.
 ·                 Committed to a 20-percent reduction in water usage (gallons per MWh generated) by 2020, and surpassed that goal in 2017 with a 35-percent reduction in water used to generate electricity.
 ·                 Committed to a cumulative waste reduction goal of one million cubic yards of landfill space avoided by 2019, and met that goal in 2017.
 
CMS Energy and Consumers are monitoring numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives, including those to regulate greenhouse gases, and related litigation. They are also monitoring potential changes in policies under the Trump administration. While CMS Energy and Consumers cannot predict the outcome of these matters, which could have a material effect on the companies, they intend to continue to move forward with their clean energy plan, their carbon reduction goals, and their emphasis on supply diversity.
 
Profit: The profit element of the triple bottom line represents CMS Energys and Consumers commitment to meeting financial objectives and providing economic development opportunities and benefits in the communities in which they do business. CMS Energys and Consumers financial strength allows them to maintain solid investment-grade credit ratings and thereby reduce funding costs for the benefit of customers and investors, to preserve and create jobs, and to reinvest in the communities they serve.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS
 
Consumers Electric Utility
 
Electric Utility Operations: Consumers electric utility operations, which include the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity, generated operating revenue of $4.4 billion in 2017, $4.4 billion in 2016, and $4.2 billion in 2015. Consumers electric utility customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigans Lower Peninsula.
 
Presented in the following illustration is Consumers 2017 electric utility operating revenue of $4.4 billion by customer class:
 

Residential (43%)
Commercial (34%) 
Industrial (17%) 
Other (6%) 

 
Consumers electric utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial condition.
 
In 2017, Consumers electric deliveries were 37 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of three billion kWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 34 billion kWh. In 2016, Consumers electric deliveries were 38 billion kWh, which included ROA deliveries of four billion kWh, resulting in net bundled sales of 34 billion kWh.
 
Consumers electric utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of electric energy typically increases in the summer months, due primarily to the use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment.
 
19




Presented in the following illustration are Consumers monthly weather-adjusted electric deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including ROA deliveries, during 2017 and 2016:
 

Consumers 2017 summer peak demand was 7,634 MW, which included ROA demand of 577 MW. For the 2016-2017 winter season, Consumers peak demand was 5,924 MW, which included ROA demand of 475 MW. As required by MISO reserve margin requirements, Consumers owns or controls, through long-term PPAs and short-term capacity purchases, all of the capacity required to supply its projected firm peak load and necessary reserve margin for summer 2018.
 
Electric Utility Properties: Consumers owns and operates generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. For details about Consumers electric generation facilities, see the Electric Utility Generation and Supply Mix section that follows this Electric Utility Properties section.

1              Represents Consumers share of net pumped-storage generation. During 2017, the pumped-storage facility consumed 997 GWh of electricity to pump water during off-peak hours for storage in order to generate 707 GWh of electricity later during peak-demand hours.
 
2              Represents purchases under long-term PPAs.
 
3              Represents purchases from the MISO energy market.
 
During 2017, Consumers acquired 55 percent of the electricity it provided to customers through long-term PPAs and the MISO energy market. Consumers offers its generation into the MISO energy market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the demand of its customers. Consumers is a net purchaser of power and supplements its generation capability with purchases from the MISO energy market to meet its customers needs during peak demand periods.
 
At December 31, 2017, Consumers had unrecognized future commitments (amounts for which, in accordance with GAAP, liabilities have not been recorded on its balance sheet) to purchase capacity and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating plants. These contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the plants availability or deliverability. The payments for 2018 through 2036 are estimated to total $9 billion and, for each of the next five years, $1 billion annually. These amounts may vary depending on plant availability and fuel costs. For further information about Consumers future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCapital Resources and Liquidity and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 4, Contingencies and CommitmentsContractual Commitments.
 
During 2017, 28 percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its coal-fueled generating units, which burned six million tons of coal and produced a combined total of 10,098 GWh of electricity.
 
23




In order to obtain the coal it needs, Consumers enters into physical coal supply contracts. At December 31, 2017, Consumers had contracts to purchase coal through December 2019; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $82 million. Most of Consumers rail-supplied coal contracts have fixed prices, although some contain market-based pricing. Consumers vessel-supplied coal contracts have fixed base prices that are adjusted monthly to reflect changes to the fuel cost of vessel transportation. At December 31, 2017, Consumers had 79 percent of its 2018 expected coal requirements under contract, as well as a 53-day supply of coal on hand.
 
In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases a fleet of railcars and has transportation contracts with various companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to Consumers generating facilities. Consumers coal transportation contracts expire on various dates through December 2019; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $294 million at December 31, 2017.
 
During 2017, 15 percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its natural gas-fueled generating units, which burned 39 bcf of natural gas and produced a combined total of 5,190 GWh of electricity.
 
In order to obtain the gas it needs for electric generation fuel, Consumers electric utility purchases gas from the market near the time of consumption, at prices that allow it to compete in the electric wholesale market. For units 3 and 4 of D.E. Karn and for the Jackson and Zeeland plants, Consumers utilizes an agent that owns firm transportation rights to each plant to purchase gas from the market and transport the gas to the facilities. For its smaller combustion turbines, Consumers electric utility purchases and transports gas to its facilities as a bundled-rate tariff customer of either the gas utility or DTE Gas.
 
Electric Utility Competition: Consumers electric utility business is subject to actual and potential competition from many sources, in both the wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric delivery, and retail services.
 
Under Michigan law, electric customers in Consumers service territory are allowed to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to ten percent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. At December 31, 2017, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten-percent limit. Of Consumers 1.8 million electric customers, 287 customers, or 0.02 percent, purchased generation service under the ROA program. For additional information see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOutlookConsumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties.
 
Consumers also faces competition or potential competition associated with industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their production capacity outside of Consumers service territory for economic reasons; municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery systems; and customer self-generation. Consumers addresses this competition in various ways, including:
 
·                 aggressively controlling operating, maintenance, and fuel costs and passing savings on to customers
 ·                 providing renewable energy options
 ·                 providing competitive rate-design options, particularly for large energy-intensive customers
 ·                 offering tariff-based incentives that support economic development
 ·                 providing non-energy services and value to customers
 ·                 monitoring activity in adjacent geographical areas

Consumers Gas Utility
 
Gas Utility Operations: Consumers gas utility operations, which include the purchase, transmission, storage, distribution, and sale of natural gas, generated operating revenue of $1.8 billion in 2017, $1.7 billion in 2016, and $1.9 billion in 2015. Consumers gas utility customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigans Lower Peninsula.
 
Presented in the following illustration is Consumers 2017 gas utility operating revenue of $1.8 billion by customer class:
 

Residential (58%)
GCC (19%) 
Commercial (13%) 
Industrial (4%) 
Other (6%) 

 
Consumers gas utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers financial condition.
 
In 2017, deliveries of natural gas through Consumers pipeline and distribution network, including off-system transportation deliveries, totaled 352 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 42 bcf. In 2016, deliveries of natural gas, including off-system transportation deliveries, through Consumers pipeline and distribution network, totaled 358 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 46 bcf. Consumers gas utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of natural gas typically increases in the winter, due primarily to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as a heating fuel. Consumers injects natural gas into storage during the summer months for use during the winter months. During 2017, 47 percent of the natural gas supplied to all customers during the winter months was supplied from storage.
 
25




Presented in the following illustration are Consumers monthly weather-adjusted natural gas deliveries (deliveries adjusted to reflect normal weather conditions) to its customers, including GCC deliveries, during 2017 and 2016:
 

Gas Utility Properties: Consumers gas transmission, storage, and distribution system consists of:
 
·                 1,672 miles of transmission lines
 ·                 15 gas storage fields with a total storage capacity of 309 bcf and a working gas volume of 151 bcf
 ·                 28,194 miles of distribution mains

Gas Utility Supply: In 2017, Consumers purchased 80 percent of the gas it delivered from U.S. producers and two percent from Canadian producers. The remaining 18 percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program. Presented in the following illustration are the supply arrangements for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR customers during 2017:
 

GCR firm city-gate contracts (43%) 
GCR firm gas transportation contracts (39%) 
GCC suppliers (18%) 

 
Firm gas transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that define a fixed amount, price, and delivery time frame. Consumers firm gas transportation contracts are with Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company and Trunkline Gas Company, LLC, each a non-affiliated company. Under these contracts, Consumers purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate delivery to its customers. Consumers firm gas transportation contracts expire on various dates through 2023 and provide for the delivery of 37 percent of Consumers total gas supply requirements in 2018. Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under the GCC program.
 
Gas Utility Competition: Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers gas utility business. Competition comes from GCC and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.
 
Enterprises SegmentNon-Utility Operations and Investments
 
CMS Energys enterprises segment, through various subsidiaries and certain equity investments, is engaged in domestic independent power production, the marketing of independent power production, and the development of renewable generation. The enterprises segments operating revenue was $229 million in 2017, $215 million in 2016, and $190 million in 2015.

The operating revenue from independent power production was $16 million in 2017, $16 million in 2016, and $17 million in 2015.
 
Energy Resource Management: CMS ERM purchases and sells energy commodities in support of CMS Energys generating facilities with a focus on optimizing CMS Energys independent power production portfolio. In 2017, CMS ERM marketed six bcf of natural gas and 4,954 GWh of electricity. Electricity marketed by CMS ERM was generated by independent power production of the enterprises segment and by unrelated third parties. CMS ERMs operating revenue was $213 million in 2017, $199 million in 2016, and $173 million in 2015.
 
Enterprises Segment Competition: The enterprises segment competes with other independent power producers. The needs of this market are driven by electric demand and the generation available.
 
Other Businesses
 
EnerBank: EnerBank is a Utah state-chartered, FDIC-insured industrial bank providing unsecured consumer installment loans for financing home improvements. EnerBanks operating revenue was $132 million in 2017, $120 million in 2016, and $101 million in 2015.
CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS REGULATION
 
CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local governmental agencies, including those described in the following sections.
 
FERC and NERC
 
FERC has exercised limited jurisdiction over several independent power plants and exempt wholesale generators in which CMS Enterprises has ownership interests, as well as over CMS ERM, CMS Gas Transmission, and DIG. FERCs jurisdiction includes, among other things, acquisitions, operations, disposals of certain assets and facilities, services provided and rates charged, and conduct among affiliates. FERC also has limited jurisdiction over holding company matters with respect to CMS Energy. FERC, in connection with NERC and with regional reliability organizations, also regulates generation and
 
28




transmission owners and operators, load serving entities, purchase and sale entities, and others with regard to reliability of the bulk power system.
 
FERC regulates limited aspects of Consumers gas business, principally compliance with FERC capacity release rules, shipping rules, the prohibition against certain buy/sell transactions, and the price-reporting rule.
 
FERC also regulates certain aspects of Consumers electric operations, including compliance with FERC accounting rules, wholesale and transmission rates, operation of licensed hydroelectric generating plants, transfers of certain facilities, corporate mergers, and issuances of securities.
 
MPSC
 
Consumers is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC, which regulates public utilities in Michigan with respect to retail utility rates, accounting, utility services, certain facilities, certain asset transfers, corporate mergers, and other matters.
 
The Michigan Attorney General, ABATE, the MPSC Staff, and certain other parties typically participate in MPSC proceedings concerning Consumers. These parties often challenge various aspects of those proceedings, including the prudence of Consumers policies and practices, and seek cost disallowances and other relief. The parties also have appealed significant MPSC orders.
 
Rate Proceedings: For information regarding open rate proceedings, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOutlook and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 3, Regulatory Matters.
 
Other Regulation
 
The U.S. Secretary of Energy regulates imports and exports of natural gas and has delegated various aspects of this jurisdiction to FERC and the U.S. Department of Energys Office of Fossil Fuels.
 
The U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety regulates the safety and security of gas pipelines through the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 and subsequent laws.
 
EnerBank is regulated by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC.
 
Energy Legislation
 
In December 2016, Michigans governor signed the 2016 Energy Law, which became effective in April 2017. Among other things, the 2016 Energy Law:
 
·                 raised the renewable energy standard from the present ten-percent requirement to 12.5 percent by 2019 and 15 percent by 2021
 ·                 established a goal of 35 percent combined renewable energy and energy waste reduction by 2025
 ·                 authorized incentives for demand response programs and expanded existing incentives for energy efficiency programs, referring to the combined initiatives as energy waste reduction programs
 ·                 authorized incentives for new PPAs with non-affiliates
 ·                 established an integrated planning process for new generation resources
 ·                 shortened from twelve months to ten months the time by which the MPSC must issue a final order in general rate cases, but prohibited electric and gas utilities from filing general rate cases for increases in rates more often than once every twelve months
 
29




·                 eliminated utilities self-implementation of rates in general rate cases filed after the effective date of the 2016 Energy Law
 ·                 required the MPSC to implement equitable cost-of-service rates for customers participating in a net metering program
 
The 2016 Energy Law also established a path to ensure that forward capacity is secured for all electric customers in Michigan, including customers served by alternative electric suppliers under ROA. Under Michigan law, electric customers in Consumers service territory are allowed to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount up to ten percent of Consumers weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year. For additional information see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOutlookConsumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties.
 
CMS ENERGY AND CONSUMERS ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGY
 
CMS Energy and Consumers are committed to protecting the environment; this commitment extends beyond compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In 2017, Consumers was ranked as the top company in Michigan, and the ninth in the nation, in Newsweeks annual Green Rankings, a survey that ranks the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. on environmental performance and considers such factors as support for clean energy, reduction of carbon emissions, and efforts to reduce and divert waste. CMS Energy and Consumers continue to focus on opportunities to reduce their carbon footprint in electric generation. In 2016, Consumers retired 33 percent of its owned coal-fueled generating capacity and presently provides ten percent of its electricity from renewable sources. Consumers has opened two solar generation facilities in Michigan, and CMS Energy is developing two more that are scheduled to begin operations in 2018. In addition, Consumers is expanding its Cross Winds® Energy Park. For additional information on stewardship goals, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsExecutive Overview.
 
CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental regulations for air and water quality, solid waste management, and other matters. Consumers expects to recover costs to comply with environmental regulations in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result. For additional information concerning environmental matters, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOutlook, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 4, Contingencies and Commitments.
 
CMS Energy has recorded a $48 million liability for its subsidiaries obligations associated with Bay Harbor and Consumers has recorded an $88 million liability for its obligations at a number of MGP sites. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNotes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 4, Contingencies and Commitments.
 
Solid Waste Disposal: Costs related to the construction, operation, and closure of solid waste disposal facilities for coal ash are significant. Consumers solid waste disposal areas are regulated under Michigans solid waste rules. In 2015, the EPA published a final rule regulating CCRs, such as coal ash, under RCRA. The final rule adopts minimum standards for beneficially reusing and disposing of non-hazardous CCRs. The rule establishes new minimum requirements for site location, groundwater monitoring, flood protection, storm water design, fugitive dust control, and public disclosure of information. The rule also sets out conditions under which CCR units would be forced to cease receiving CCR and non-CCR waste and initiate closure based on the inability to achieve minimum safety standards, meet a location standard, or meet minimum groundwater standards. Consumers has converted all of its fly ash handling systems to dry systems to minimize applicable requirements. In addition, all of Consumers ash facilities have programs designed to protect the environment and are subject to quarterly MDEQ
 
30




inspections. Consumers preliminary estimate of capital and cost of removal expenditures to comply with regulations relating to ash disposal is $215 million from 2018 through 2022.
 
Water: Consumers uses substantial amounts of water to operate and cool its electric generating plants. Water discharge quality is regulated and administered by the MDEQ under the federal NPDES program. To comply with such regulation, Consumers facilities have discharge monitoring programs. The EPA issued final regulations for wastewater discharges from electric generating plants in 2015 and amended them in September 2017. Consumers preliminary estimate of capital expenditures to comply with these regulations as presently promulgated is $49 million from 2018 through 2022.
 
In 2014, the EPA finalized its cooling water intake rule, which requires Consumers to evaluate the biological impact of its cooling water intake systems and ensure that it is using the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts. Consumers preliminary estimate of capital expenditures to comply with these regulations is $89 million from 2018 through 2022.
 
Air: Consumers is subject to federal and state environmental regulations that require extensive reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, and mercury emissions. To comply with these regulations, Consumers has invested in emissions control equipment at its electric generating plants. Consumers preliminary estimate of additional capital expenditures to comply with these regulations is $14 million from 2018 through 2022.
 
Consumers future costs to comply with solid waste disposal, water, and air environmental regulations may vary depending on future legislation, litigation, or rulemaking.
 
For further information concerning estimated capital expenditures related to solid waste disposal, water, and air, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOutlookConsumers Electric Utility Outlook and UncertaintiesElectric Environmental Outlook.
 
INSURANCE
 
CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in the same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not fully compensate CMS Energy or Consumers for all losses. A portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMS Energy or Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMS Energy or Consumers renews its policies, it is possible that some of the present insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance markets.
 
CMS Energys and Consumers present insurance program may not entirely cover the risks of certain environmental costs, such as the cleanup of sites owned by CMS Energy or Consumers, claims for the long-term storage or disposal of pollutants, or claims related to air pollution.
