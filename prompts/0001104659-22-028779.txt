Item 1.  Business
Introduction
We are a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this annual report as our initial business combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act because we have no operations, other than in connection with our search for a business combination, and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
Our executive offices are located at 9 West 57th Street, 43rd Floor, New York, NY 10019, and our telephone number is (212) 515-3200. Our corporate website address is https://apollostrategicgrowthcapital.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this annual report. You should not rely on any such information in making your decision whether to invest in our securities.
Company History
In October 2008, the Company was formed by Apollo Principal Holdings III, L.P. (“Holdings”) and in August 2020, Holdings transferred its ownership in the Company to our sponsor, APSG Sponsor, L.P. As of March 1, 2022, our sponsor owned 20,345,250 of the 20,420,250 Class B ordinary shares outstanding.
Initial Public Offering
On October 6, 2020, we consummated the initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 75,000,000 units (the “Units”), and in connection therewith granted the underwriters an over-allotment option to purchase an additional 11,250,000 Units (the “Over-Allotment Units”). The Units sold in the Initial Public Offering were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $750,000,000. Each Unit consists of one of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.00005 per share, and one-third of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
Simultaneous with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 11,333,334 warrants, each exercisable to purchase one of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares for $11.50 per share (“Private Placement Warrants”), to our sponsor at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $17,000,000. Of the gross proceeds received from the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants, $750,000,000 was placed in a trust account (the “trust account”). Each whole private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.

On November 10, 2020, the Company consummated the sale of 6,681,000 Over-Allotment Units pursuant to the underwriters’ partial exercise of their over-allotment option. Such Over-Allotment Units were sold at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $66,810,000. Substantially concurrently with the closing of the sale of 6,681,000 Over-Allotment Units, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 890,800 Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $1,336,200. Following the closing of the over-allotment option and sale of additional Private Placement Warrants (together, the “Over-Allotment Closing”), a total of $816,810,000, including approximately $28,588,350 of underwriters’ deferred discount, was held in the trust account.
On November 20, 2020, we announced that, commencing November 23, 2020, holders of the Units may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares and the warrants included in the Units. Those Units not separated continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “APSG.U” and the Class A ordinary shares and warrants that are separated trade under the symbols “APSG” and “APSG WS,” respectively.
GBT Business Combination
On December 2, 2021, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with GBT, a company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of Jersey, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Business Combination Agreement, GBT will become our direct subsidiary, with us being renamed “Global Business Travel Group, Inc.” (“PubCo”) and conducting its business through GBT in an umbrella partnership-C corporation structure (an “Up-C structure”). Upon the consummation of the business combination transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (such transactions, the “Business Combination”, and such consummation, the “Closing”), the existing shareholders of GBT (other than any holders of GBT MIP Shares (as defined below)) (the “Continuing JerseyCo Owners”) will together acquire a majority voting interest in PubCo and maintain a majority economic interest in GBT, and our existing shareholders will own a minority voting interest in PubCo and an indirect minority economic interest in the GBT business.
Pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms, and subject to the conditions, of the Business Combination Agreement, we will change our jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware by effecting a deregistration under the Cayman Islands Companies Act (2021 Revision), as amended, and a domestication under Section 388 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the “DGCL”) (such domestication, the “Domestication”). Upon the effectiveness of the Domestication, (a) each issued and outstanding Class A ordinary share of APSG (“Class A ordinary share” or “public share”) will automatically convert into one share of Class A common stock of APSG (“Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock”); (b) each issued and outstanding Class B ordinary share of APSG (“Class B ordinary share,” and together with Class A ordinary shares, “Acquiror Cayman Shares”) will automatically convert into one share of Class X common stock of APSG (“Domesticated Acquiror Class X Common Stock”); (c) each issued and outstanding warrant to purchase one Class A ordinary share (“Acquiror Cayman Warrant”) will automatically convert into one warrant to purchase one share of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock (“Domesticated Acquiror Warrant”); and (d) each issued and outstanding unit of APSG (“Acquiror Cayman Unit”) will separate automatically into one share of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock and one-third of one Domesticated Acquiror Warrant. In addition, pursuant to the certificate of incorporation of PubCo (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), upon the Closing, each share of Domesticated Acquiror Class X Common Stock will automatically convert into one share of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock.

As a result of the foregoing conversions and in connection with the Closing, our existing shareholders will maintain their economic and voting rights in PubCo in the form of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock. The Continuing JerseyCo Owners, who currently hold voting ordinary shares and non-voting ordinary shares of GBT (collectively, “GBT Ordinary Shares”), preferred shares of GBT (subject to the immediately following sentence) (the “GBT Preferred Shares”) and profit shares of GBT (the “GBT Profit Shares”), will receive voting rights in PubCo in the form of Class B common stock of PubCo (“Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock”) and will maintain their economic rights (but have only certain limited voting rights as described below under “—Proposed Organizational Documents”) in GBT in the form of equity interests of GBT following the Closing designated as “B Ordinary Shares” (“OpCo B Ordinary Shares”). Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, at or prior to the Closing, each GBT Preferred Share will be redeemed and cancelled, and, in consideration therefor, the holders of GBT Preferred Shares will receive, at the option of GBT, in its sole discretion, (i) cash in accordance with the terms of GBT’s memorandum of association and articles of association as in effect immediately prior to the Closing or (ii) a number of voting ordinary shares of GBT equal to the amount of cash that such holders of GBT Preferred Shares would have received pursuant to clause (i) above divided by $10.00 or (iii) a combination of the consideration described in clause (i) and (ii). Further, (a) any non-voting management incentive plan shares of GBT (“GBT MIP Shares”) will be redeemed and cancelled and, in consideration therefor, at the option of GBT (but subject to our prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)), the holders thereof will receive either (i) cash equal to the fair market value of such GBT MIP Shares (as determined by the board of directors of GBT) or (ii) a number of shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock and OpCo C Ordinary Shares (as defined below); and (b) each option to purchase GBT MIP Shares (each, a “GBT MIP Option”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, whether vested or unvested, will be equitably converted based on a deemed $10.00 price per share of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock into an option to purchase shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock on substantially the same terms and conditions as are in effect with respect to such GBT MIP Option immediately prior to the Closing (each, an “Acquiror Option”) in a manner determined by GBT in consultation with us and consistent with certain U.S. tax regulations.
In addition, in connection with the Closing, PubCo will acquire and hold all equity interests of GBT designated as “A Ordinary Shares” (“OpCo A Ordinary Shares”), which will have pro rata economic rights and all of the voting rights in GBT (subject to certain limited rights of the OpCo B Ordinary Shares described below under “—Proposed Organizational Documents”), and one non-redeemable “Z Ordinary Share” (“OpCo Z Ordinary Share”), which will have no economic or voting rights in GBT, in exchange for a purchase price equal to the sum of (a) the amount of cash available in our trust account following the Special Meeting (as defined below), after deducting the amount required to satisfy any redemptions by our existing shareholders and the amount required to satisfy any unpaid transaction expenses, plus the amount of our cash on hand (outside of the trust account) immediately prior to the Closing, plus (b) the aggregate amount of the PIPE Investment (as defined below), plus (c) the amount of cash actually drawn under any debt financing obtained by us (excluding any loans or other indebtedness or transaction expenses repaid at or prior to the Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the “Transactions”)) prior to or at the Closing, plus (d) the Acquiror Class B Common Stock Purchase Price (as defined below) (the “Acquiror Subscribed Ordinary Shares Purchase Price”).
The number of OpCo B Ordinary Shares (and corresponding shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock) and shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock (including those underlying the Acquiror Options) issued to the Continuing JerseyCo Owners and former holders of GBT MIP Shares and GBT MIP Options, as well as any Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock issued upon the exercise of any Acquiror Options (as may be permitted by GBT or PubCo) or upon the exchange of any OpCo B Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Exchange Agreement (as described below), are subject to certain adjustments (the “Egencia Adjustments”) in connection with the post-closing equity adjustment (the “Post-Closing Equity Adjustment”) required under the Equity Contribution Agreement, dated as of August 11, 2021, by and among Expedia, Inc., GBT and Juweel Investors Limited entered into in connection with GBT’s acquisition of the Egencia business from an affiliate of Expedia, Inc., EG Corporate Travel Holdings LLC (“Expedia”), if the final determination of the Post-Closing Equity Adjustment has not occurred prior to the Closing; provided, that if GBT and Expedia agree to settle, and do in fact settle, any Post-Closing Equity Adjustment, in whole, for an amount in cash of $5 million or less, then no adjustment will be made.

Earnout
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement and on the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, the holders of GBT Ordinary Shares, GBT Preferred Shares, GBT Profit Shares, GBT MIP Shares and certain legacy GBT MIP Options (“GBT Legacy MIP Options”) will also receive an aggregate of 15,000,000 “earnout” shares in the form of equity interests of GBT following the Closing designated as “C Ordinary Shares” (“OpCo C Ordinary Shares”), which will, upon certain post-Closing events described below occurring within five years from Closing (such period, the “Earnout Period”), (a) in the case of the former holders of GBT Ordinary Shares, GBT Preferred Shares and GBT Profit Shares, be converted and re-designated into OpCo B Ordinary Shares, with PubCo issuing such holders shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock, or (b) in the case of holders of GBT MIP Shares and GBT Legacy MIP Options, be redeemed and cancelled, with the holders thereof receiving shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock (clauses (a) and (b), each an “Earnout Achievement Distribution”). If, within the Earnout Period, the volume-weighted average price (the “VWAP”) of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock is greater than or equal to $12.50 for any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days, holders of OpCo C Ordinary Shares will receive their applicable Earnout Achievement Distribution with respect to 50% of their OpCo C Ordinary Shares. If, within the Earnout Period, the VWAP of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock is greater than or equal to $15.00 for any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days, holders of OpCo C Ordinary Shares will receive their applicable Earnout Achievement Distribution with respect to the remaining 50% of their OpCo C Ordinary Shares. The earnout may also be deemed triggered if certain consideration thresholds are satisfied in connection with the occurrence of certain change of control events during the Earnout Period. To the extent that the aforementioned triggering events do not occur within the Earnout Period, the applicable OpCo C Ordinary Shares will be forfeited and cancelled for no consideration. The Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock price targets and the number of shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock and OpCo B Ordinary Shares will be equitably adjusted for stock splits, reverse stock splits, dividends (cash or stock), reorganizations, recapitalizations, reclassifications, combinations or other like changes or transactions with respect to the OpCo B Ordinary Shares, shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock and Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock occurring after the Closing.
Representations, Warranties and Covenants
The parties to the Business Combination Agreement have made customary representations and warranties in the Business Combination Agreement. The parties have also made customary covenants in the Business Combination Agreement that apply to the pre-Closing period, including, among others, covenants with respect to (a) the conduct of business of GBT and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and our Company, on the other hand, (b) compliance with the notification and reporting requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), (c) our submission of an informal briefing paper to the United Kingdom Investment Security Unit in relation to approval of the Transactions under the National Security and Investment Act 2021 (United Kingdom) (the “NSIA”) and notification of the U.K. Secretary of State of the Transactions in accordance with section 14(1) of the NSIA, (d) the non-solicitation by either party of any proposal or offer from any third party relating to a potential competing transaction. The representations, warranties and covenants to be performed at or prior to the Closing will not survive the Closing and (e) GBT’s reasonable best efforts to enter into definitive agreements with Amex Holdco in respect of certain commercial arrangements.
In addition, we and GBT have been jointly preparing, and APSG has been filing with the SEC, mutually acceptable materials which include the proxy statement (the “Proxy Statement”) relating to the special meeting of our shareholders in connection with the Transactions (the “Special Meeting”), and the Registration Statement with respect to the registration under the Securities Act, of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock and including the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. We agreed to, through our board of directors, recommend to our existing shareholders that they approve each of the proposals to be put forth at the Special Meeting in connection with the Transactions, including, among others, the approval of the Business Combination Agreement (the “Shareholder Proposals”), unless our board of directors has changed its recommendation in accordance with the express terms of the Business Combination Agreement (a “Modification in Recommendation”).

The Closing is subject to certain conditions, including, among other things, (i) that the approval of the Shareholder Proposals (other than any separate or unbundled advisory proposals as are required to implement the Domestication or the changes to APSG’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) has been obtained; (ii) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act (which expired at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on January 18, 2022) and receipt of approval from (or a notification or final notification that no further action will be taken by) the U.K. Secretary of State pursuant to the NSIA (including a notification by the U.K. Secretary of State that no further action will be taken in relation to the transaction, or final notification by the U.K. Secretary of State that no further action will be taken by the NSIA in relation to a call-in notice in respect of the transaction) (which was received on February 23, 2022); (iii) that the amount of available cash at Closing, including the amount in our trust account (net of APSG Share Redemption (as defined below), our cash on hand (outside the trust account) and the aggregate gross purchase price received by us in connection with the PIPE Investment, is at least $300 million (which is only a condition in favor of GBT, but cannot be waived without our prior written consent (such consent to not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)); (iv) satisfaction of covenant and representation and warranty bring-down conditions and receipt of certificates from each party certifying the satisfaction of such conditions; (v) the absence of any law or order that would prohibit or make illegal the Transactions; (vi) the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect or an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect (as each is defined in the Business Combination Agreement); (vii) the approval of the listing of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange; (viii) the effectiveness of the Domestication; (ix) APSG’s net tangible assets not being less than $5,000,001; and (x) the effectiveness of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

Termination Rights
The Business Combination Agreement may be terminated by either us or GBT at any time prior to Closing as follows: (a) by mutual written consent of us and GBT; (b) by either us or GBT if any applicable government entity enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any order which has become final and non-appealable and has the effect of enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Business Combination, or if a law is adopted that permanently makes consummation of the Business Combination illegal or otherwise prohibited; (c) by either us or GBT if approval of the Shareholder Proposals is not obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof; (d) by GBT prior to us obtaining approval of the Shareholder Proposals at the Special Meeting if there has been a Modification in Recommendation; (e) by either us or GBT if the other party breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements such that the conditions to Closing relating to the representations, warranties and covenants of such other party would not be satisfied at the Closing (subject to a cure period), so long as the terminating party is not then in material breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements such that the conditions to the obligations of the other party would not be satisfied at the Closing; or (f) by either us or GBT if the Closing has not occurred on or before August 2, 2022.
The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of the contract among the parties and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the Business Combination Agreement. The Business Combination Agreement has been included as Exhibit 2.1 to provide investors with information regarding its terms and is not intended to provide any other factual information about APSG, GBT or any other person or entity. In particular, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the Business Combination Agreement, which were made only for purposes of the Business Combination Agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Business Combination Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties (including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Business Combination Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts) and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors and reports and documents filed with the SEC. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, or any descriptions thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of any party to the Business Combination Agreement. In addition, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements and other terms of the Business Combination Agreement may be subject to subsequent waiver or modification. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties and other terms may change after the date of the Business Combination Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in APSG’s public disclosures.

Proposed Organizational Documents
Following the Closing, the rights of holders of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock and Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock will be governed by the Proposed Charter and the Bylaws of PubCo (the “Proposed Bylaws”). The Proposed Charter contains provisions related to the Egencia Adjustments and exchanges under the Exchange Agreement (as defined below). Pursuant to the Proposed Charter, PubCo will elect not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL. The Proposed Charter will, however, include provisions similar to Section 203 of the DGCL that generally prohibit PubCo from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless (i) such person became an interested stockholder as a result of a transaction approved by the PubCo board of directors (other than the Business Combination), (ii) such person acquired at least 85% of PubCo’s voting stock (excluding shares owned by officers and directors of PubCo and employee stock plans) in the transaction by which such person became an interested stockholder or (iii) such transactions are approved by the PubCo board of directors and the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of PubCo’s outstanding voting stock (other than such stock owned by the interested stockholder). In general, a person and its affiliates and associates will be an “interested stockholder” under the Proposed Charter if such person (a) holds at least 15% of PubCo’s voting stock or is an affiliate or associate of PubCo and (b) held at least 15% of PubCo’s voting stock at any time during the three-year period preceding the date on which it is sought to be determined whether such person is an interested stockholder; however, a person that acquires greater than 15% of PubCo’s voting stock solely as a result of actions taken by PubCo will not be an interested stockholder unless such person thereafter acquires additional shares of voting stock other than as a result of further corporate action not caused by such person. Further, the foregoing restrictions will not apply if the business combination is with a person who became an interested stockholder as a result of the Business Combination (provided such person does not acquire more than an additional 1% of the outstanding shares of PubCo’s voting stock after the date of the Closing). The Proposed Charter generally contains customary provisions for the certificate of incorporation of a publicly traded company, including provisions for a classified board of directors. The Proposed Bylaws generally contain customary provisions for the bylaws of a publicly traded company.
Following the Closing, the rights of holders of OpCo A Ordinary Shares, OpCo B Ordinary Shares, Opco C Ordinary Shares and OpCo Z Ordinary Shares will be governed by the Fourth Amended & Restated Memorandum of Association of GBT and the Third Amended & Restated Articles of Association of GBT (collectively, the “GBT Amended and Restated M&A”). The GBT Amended and Restated M&A will, among other things, modify GBT’s capital structure by reorganizing the different classes of shares currently held by the shareholders of GBT into new OpCo B Ordinary Shares and authorizing new OpCo A Ordinary Shares (which will be issued to PubCo), OpCo C Ordinary Shares (which will be issued to the Continuing JerseyCo Owners and certain other persons as described above) and the OpCo Z Ordinary Share (which will be issued to PubCo). OpCo A Ordinary Shares will be substantially the same as OpCo B Ordinary Shares, except that only OpCo A Ordinary Shares, all of which will be held by PubCo, will have the right to vote on matters on which members of GBT generally are entitled to vote, including in the election of the board of directors of GBT. By contrast, OpCo B Ordinary Shares and OpCo C Ordinary Shares will have the right to vote only on specific matters as to which they are entitled to vote as a separate class under Jersey law. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement (as defined below), however, the Continuing JerseyCo Owners will appoint PubCo as their attorney-in-fact to, among other things, execute (x) written resolutions in their capacities as holders of OpCo B Ordinary Shares and OpCo C Ordinary Shares, as applicable, and (y) instruments appointing PubCo as their proxy to vote such shares, in each case on all such matters as to which a vote or written resolution of the holders of such shares is required by law, other than matters that relate specifically and solely to the rights, priorities and privileges of the OpCo B Ordinary Shares or the OpCo C Ordinary Shares, as applicable, or matters that have a disproportionate adverse effect on the OpCo B Ordinary Shares or the OpCo C Ordinary Shares, as applicable, as compared to any other class or series. The GBT Amended and Restated M&A will contain corollary provisions giving effect to these arrangements. The OpCo Z Ordinary Share does not have the right to vote and is non-redeemable by GBT under the GBT Amended and Restated M&A.

PIPE Subscription Agreements
On December 2, 2021, concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company entered into subscription agreements (the “PIPE Subscription Agreements”) with certain strategic and institutional investors, including the Sponsor (as defined below) (collectively, the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which, among other things, and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the PIPE Investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and the Company agreed to issue and sell to such PIPE Investors, immediately prior to the Closing, an aggregate of 33,500,000 shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock at a cash purchase price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price equal to $335 million (the “PIPE Investment”). Of the 33,500,000 shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the PIPE Subscription Agreements, the Sponsor has agreed to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock on the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors at a price of $10.00 per share. The PIPE Subscription Agreements contain customary representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company and the PIPE Investors and are subject to customary closing conditions, including the substantially concurrent consummation of the Business Combination.
Pursuant to the PIPE Subscription Agreements, PubCo is required to submit or file with the SEC, within (i) 30 calendar days after the Closing or (ii) 90 calendar days following PubCo’s most recent fiscal year end if audited financials for the year ended December 31, 2021 are required to be included, a registration statement on Form S-1 or Form S-3, as applicable (“Shelf”), covering the resale of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock issued pursuant to the PIPE Subscription Agreements and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have such Shelf declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than the earlier of (i) 60 calendar days (or 90 calendar days if the SEC notifies PubCo that it will “review” the Shelf) after the filing thereof and (ii) the 10th business day after the date PubCo is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that the Shelf will not be “reviewed” or will not be subject to further review. The PIPE Subscription Agreements will terminate and be void with no further force or effect upon the earliest to occur of: (a) such date and time as the Business Combination Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; (b) the mutual written agreement of the parties to the PIPE Subscription Agreement and GBT; or (c) if the applicable PIPE Investment has not been consummated within 10 months after the date thereof, other than as a result of breach by the terminating party.
Acquiror Class B Common Stock Subscription Agreement
In connection with the Business Combination Agreement, PubCo and GBT will enter into a subscription agreement (the “Acquiror Class B Common Stock Subscription Agreement”) pursuant to which PubCo will issue and sell to GBT, and GBT will subscribe for and purchase from PubCo, shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock (the “GBT Subscription”) in exchange for the amount which equals the product of (a) $0.0001 per share and (b) the aggregate number of shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock to be subscribed for by GBT (the “Acquiror Class B Common Stock Purchase Price”).
Acquiror Subscribed Ordinary Shares Subscription Agreement
In connection with the Business Combination Agreement, GBT and PubCo will enter into a subscription agreement (the “Acquiror Subscribed Ordinary Shares Subscription Agreement”) pursuant to which GBT will issue and sell to PubCo, and PubCo will subscribe for and purchase from GBT, OpCo A Ordinary Shares and one OpCo Z Ordinary Share in exchange for the Acquiror Subscribed Ordinary Shares Purchase Price.
Acquiror Class B Common Stock Distribution Agreement
In connection with the Business Combination Agreement, GBT and the Continuing JerseyCo Owners will enter into a distribution agreement (the “Acquiror Class B Common Stock Distribution Agreement”) pursuant to which, following the GBT Subscription, GBT will distribute to the Continuing JerseyCo Owners, and each Continuing JerseyCo Owner will accept from GBT, the shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock that GBT acquired in connection with the GBT Subscription, in partial consideration for the redemption and cancellation of the GBT Ordinary Shares held by the Continuing JerseyCo Owners.

Sponsor Support Agreement
In connection with the Business Combination Agreement, on December 2, 2021, the Sponsor, members of our board of directors and management (the “Insiders”) and GBT entered into a support agreement (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”). Pursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement, the Sponsor and each Insider agreed to, among other things, vote or cause to be voted, all of the Acquiror Cayman Shares beneficially owned by it, at the Special Meeting: (i) in favor of all the Shareholder Proposals, (ii) against any competing transaction, (iii) against any change in the business, our management or our board of directors that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect our ability to consummate the Transactions or is otherwise inconsistent with any of our obligations under the Business Combination Agreement, and (iv) against any other proposal, agreement or action that would reasonably be expected to (a) impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify, or materially delay or materially impair our ability to perform our obligations under, any provision of the Business Combination Agreement or the transaction documents, (b) result in any of the conditions to Closing not being satisfied or (c) result in our breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement under the Business Combination Agreement or result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the Sponsor or the Insiders contained in the Sponsor Support Agreement. The Sponsor and each Insider also agreed not to redeem any of the Acquiror Cayman Shares beneficially owned by them in connection with the Transactions or sell any of their Acquiror Cayman Shares, Acquiror Cayman Units or Acquiror Cayman Warrants (other than to certain permitted transferees) during the pre-Closing period. Further, the Sponsor and each Insider have agreed to comply with certain provisions of the Business Combination Agreement, including the provisions regarding non-solicitation, confidentiality and publicity, as if they were APSG with respect to such provisions, and to execute and deliver all documents and take all actions reasonably necessary by them for us to comply with its obligations relating to regulatory approvals in the Business Combination Agreement.
Sponsor Side Letter
In connection with the Business Combination Agreement, on December 2, 2021, the Sponsor, the Insiders, APSG and GBT entered into a letter agreement (the “Sponsor Side Letter”). Pursuant to the Sponsor Side Letter, the Sponsor and each Insider has agreed not to transfer (other than to certain permitted transferees) (i) any shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock issued to each of them at the Closing, until the earlier to occur of (a) one year following the Closing and (b) (x) the date on which the last reported sale price of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the Closing or (y) the date on which PubCo completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of PubCo’s shareholders having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property; and (ii) any of the Domesticated Acquiror Warrants (or any shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock issued or issuable upon exercise of the Domesticated Acquiror Warrants) issued to each of them at the Closing until 30 days after the Closing.
In addition, pursuant to the Sponsor Side Letter, the Sponsor has agreed that 13,631,318 of the shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock issued to the Sponsor at the Closing (the “Sponsor Shares”) will immediately vest without restrictions and 6,713,932 of the Sponsor Shares will be deemed unvested subject to certain triggering events to occur within five years from Closing (such period, the “Sponsor Side Letter Vesting Period”). If, within the Sponsor Side Letter Vesting Period, the VWAP of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock is greater than or equal to $12.50 for any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days, 3,356,966 of the unvested Sponsor Shares will vest. If, within the Sponsor Side Letter Vesting Period, the VWAP of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock is greater than or equal to $15.00 for any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days, the remaining 3,356,966 of the unvested Sponsor Shares will vest. The Sponsor Shares may also be deemed vested if certain consideration thresholds are satisfied in connection with the occurrence of certain change of control events during the Sponsor Side Letter Vesting Period. To the extent that either of the aforementioned triggering events do not occur within the Sponsor Side Letter Vesting Period, such Sponsor Shares will be forfeited and surrendered to PubCo. The number of shares and the price targets listed above will be equitably adjusted for stock splits, reverse stock splits, dividends (cash or stock), reorganizations, recapitalizations, reclassifications, combinations or other like changes or transactions with respect to the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock occurring after the Closing.

Company Holders Support Agreement
In connection with the Business Combination Agreement, on December 2, 2021, the Continuing JerseyCo Owners and GBT entered into a support agreement (the “Company Holders Support Agreement”). Pursuant to the Company Holders Support Agreement, each of the Continuing JerseyCo Owners agreed to, among other things, during the pre-Closing period, execute, deliver or otherwise grant any action by written consent, special resolution or other approval, or vote or cause to be voted at any meeting of shareholders of GBT: (i) in favor of any such consent, resolution or other approval, as may be required under the organizational documents of GBT or applicable law or otherwise sought with respect to the Business Combination Agreement or the Transactions (including in order to effect the transactions set forth in Section 2.1 of the Business Combination Agreement) and (ii) against any competing transaction and any other proposal, agreement or action that would reasonably be expected to (a) prevent or nullify, or materially delay or materially impair the ability of GBT to perform its obligations under, any provision of the Business Combination Agreement or the transaction documents, (b) result in any of the conditions to Closing not being satisfied or (c) result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the Continuing JerseyCo Owners contained in the Company Holders Support Agreement. Each of the Continuing JerseyCo Owners also agreed not to sell any of its GBT Ordinary Shares, GBT Preferred Shares or GBT Profit Shares (other than to certain permitted transferees) during the pre-Closing period. Further, each Continuing JerseyCo Owner has agreed to comply with certain provisions of the Business Combination Agreement, including the provisions regarding non-solicitation and publicity, as if they were GBT with respect to such provisions, and to execute and deliver on the date of Closing, the Shareholders Agreement, the Acquiror Class B Common Stock Distribution Agreement, the Exchange Agreement (as defined below) and the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below).
Additionally, each Continuing JerseyCo Owner has agreed not to transfer, until the 180th day following the date of Closing (the “UW Lock-Up Release Date”), any equity securities of PubCo or GBT (subject to certain permitted exceptions); provided, that if the final determination of the Post-Closing Equity Adjustment has not occurred prior to the expiration of the UW Lock-Up Release Date, then each Continuing JerseyCo Owner agrees to retain and not transfer at least 5% of each class of securities of each of PubCo and GBT (subject to certain permitted exceptions) that it receives in connection with the Closing, from the UW Lock-Up Release Date until the completion of the implementation of the adjustments set forth in the Business Combination Agreement in connection with the Post-Closing Equity Adjustment.
Amex Holdco and its affiliates have also agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to enter into definitive agreements with GBT in respect of certain commercial arrangements.
Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement
At the Closing, PubCo, the Sponsor, the Insiders and the Continuing JerseyCo Owners (collectively, the “Holders”) will enter into an amended and restated registration rights agreement pursuant to which, among other things, PubCo will agree to register for resale, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, certain shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock and other equity securities of PubCo that are held by the Holders from time to time (the “Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement”). Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, PubCo will be required to submit or file with the SEC, within (i) 30 calendar days after the Closing or (ii) 90 calendar days following PubCo’s most recent fiscal year end if audited financials are required to be included, a Shelf covering the issuance and the resale of all such registrable securities on a delayed or continuous basis, and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have such Shelf declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than the earlier of (i) 60 calendar days (or 90 calendar days if the SEC notifies PubCo that it will “review” the Shelf) after the filing thereof and (ii) the 10th business day after the date PubCo is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that the Shelf will not be “reviewed” or will not be subject to further review.
When an effective Shelf is on file with the SEC, the Sponsor and the Insiders may collectively demand not more than one underwritten shelf takedown per fiscal quarter and each Continuing JerseyCo Owner may demand not more than one underwritten shelf takedown per fiscal quarter, in each case, subject to certain customary limitations set forth in the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, including the right of the underwriters to limit the number of securities to be included in an underwritten offering and PubCo’s right to delay or withdraw a registration statement under certain circumstances. The Holders will also be entitled to certain piggyback registration rights and indemnification rights.

10



Exchange Agreement
At the Closing, PubCo, GBT and the Continuing JerseyCo Owners will enter into an exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), giving the Continuing JerseyCo Owners (or certain of their permitted transferees) the right, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Exchange Agreement, to exchange their OpCo B Ordinary Shares (with automatic surrender for cancellation of an equal number of shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock) for shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary adjustments for stock splits, dividends, reclassifications and other similar transactions or, in certain limited circumstances, at the option of a committee of PubCo’s board consisting solely of independent and disinterested (with respect to any particular exchange) members (the “Exchange Committee”), for cash (based on the VWAP of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock for the five trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the applicable exchange date). In addition, to preserve the contemplated Up-C structure, the Exchange Agreement provides that PubCo and GBT will take (or, in some cases, forbear from taking) various actions, as necessary to maintain a one-to-one ratio between the number of issued and outstanding (x) Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock (and equivalents) and the OpCo A Ordinary Shares and (y) Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock and the OpCo B Ordinary Shares. For example, the Exchange Agreement provides that, if PubCo issues or sells additional shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, PubCo will contribute the net proceeds of such issuance and sale to GBT, and GBT will issue to PubCo an equal number of OpCo A Ordinary Shares. Similarly, the Exchange Agreement provides that neither PubCo nor GBT may effect any subdivision or combination of any of its equity securities unless the other effects an identical subdivision or combination of the corresponding class of its equity securities.
Shareholders Agreement
At Closing, PubCo, GBT, American Express Travel Holdings Netherlands Coöperatief U.A. (“Amex HoldCo”), Juweel Investors (SPC) Limited (“Juweel”) and Expedia will enter into a shareholders agreement (the “Shareholders Agreement”). The Shareholders Agreement will set forth certain agreements with respect to, among other matters, transfers of equity securities of PubCo and GBT, the governance of PubCo and GBT, tax distributions that GBT will make to PubCo and the Continuing JerseyCo Owners and certain information rights of the Continuing JerseyCo Owners.
The Shareholders Agreement will set forth various restrictions, limitations and other terms governing the Continuing JerseyCo Owners’ transfer of equity securities of PubCo and GBT (other than, in most circumstances, the OpCo A Ordinary Shares). Among other matters, and subject to certain terms, conditions and exceptions, the Shareholders Agreement generally will prohibit transfers of such equity securities to certain specified restricted persons, as well as transfers that would violate applicable securities laws or cause GBT to be treated other than as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The Shareholders Agreement will specify the initial composition of the PubCo board of directors, effective immediately upon the Domestication and Closing. PubCo will agree with each Continuing JerseyCo Owner (on a several basis), following the Closing, to take all necessary action within its control to cause its board to have eleven directors, consisting of the Chief Executive Officer, two Amex HoldCo nominees, two Juweel nominees, one Expedia nominee and, for as long as the director designated by the Sponsor is serving on the board, four independent nominees nominated by the board’s nominating and governance committee, and, following the conclusion of the Sponsor designee’s service on the board, five such nominees. If Amex HoldCo or Juweel ceases to own at least 15% of PubCo’s issued shares, it will thereafter have the right to nominate only one director, and if any Continuing JerseyCo ceases to own at least 5% of PubCo’s issued shares, it will thereafter have no right to nominate a director, except that Amex HoldCo will continue to have the right to nominate director for so long as PubCo is a “controlled entity” under the Bank Holding Company Act.
The Shareholders Agreement will also require (subject to certain specified conditions and exceptions including those described below) the approval of each Continuing JerseyCo Owner for PubCo or its subsidiaries to take certain actions, including:

● | Other than in accordance with the Proposed Charter or pursuant to an issuer tender offer or share repurchase program that, in each case, was approved by PubCo’s board of directors , the redemption, cancellation or repayment of PubCo’s or GBT’s equity securities, other than on a pro rata basis;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dividends or distributions, other than on a pro rata basis;
--+------------------------------------------------------------

11




● | Share exchanges, splits, combinations and similar actions with respect to one or more, but not all, classes or series of PubCo or GBT shares;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Amendments to GBT’s organizational documents that relate specifically and solely to rights, priorities or privileges of the OpCo B Ordinary Shares or the OpCo C Ordinary Shares, as applicable, or have a disproportionate adverse effect on such shares as compared to any other class or series of shares, and do not require a separate class vote of the holders of such shares; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Any agreement or commitment to do any of the foregoing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

In general, the foregoing approval right of a Continuing JerseyCo Owner will terminate if such Continuing JerseyCo Owner ceases to own at least 10% of the issued shares of PubCo’s stock; however, an amendment of GBT’s organizational documents of the type described in the fourth bullet in the preceding sentence will require the approval of any Continuing JerseyCo Owner to which such amendment is materially adverse, regardless of such Continuing JerseyCo Owner’s percentage ownership of PubCo’s stock at such time. The foregoing approval rights do not apply to actions that PubCo or JerseyCo undertake to effect an Egencia Adjustment or that they are authorized to undertake pursuant to the Exchange Agreement.
Each Continuing JerseyCo Owner will appoint PubCo as its attorney-in-fact to, among other things, execute (x) written resolutions in their capacities as holders of OpCo B Ordinary Shares and OpCo C Ordinary Shares, as applicable, and (y) instruments appointing PubCo as their proxy to vote such shares, in each case on all such matters as to which a vote or written resolution of the holders of such shares is required by law, other than matters that relate specifically and solely to the rights, priorities and privileges of the OpCo B Ordinary Shares or the OpCo C Ordinary Shares, as applicable, or matters that have a disproportionate adverse effect on the OpCo B Ordinary Shares or the OpCo C Ordinary Shares, as applicable, as compared to any other class or series.
The Shareholders Agreement will require GBT to make pro rata cash distributions to GBT’s shareholders, including PubCo, in amounts intended to be sufficient to enable PubCo to satisfy its liabilities for taxes, as reasonably determined by the board of directors of GBT.
The Shareholders Agreement will require PubCo and GBT to provide the Continuing JerseyCo Owners, for their financial planning processes, certain financial information beyond that which PubCo will make available publicly in its periodic reports filed with the SEC.
Business Strategy; Acquisition Criteria
Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, further accelerate the growth of a company in the public markets.
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective targets for our initial business combination. We will leverage these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but to the extent our pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated and we search for other acquisition opportunities, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire target businesses that we believe:

● | are leading companies that have exhibited positive top-line growth and/or are experiencing secular tailwinds;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have defensible and established business models, with sustainable competitive advantages and multiple avenues for growth;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | can potentially benefit from having a public currency to accelerate growth trajectory;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | can benefit from our management team and Apollo’s operating expertise, industry network and financing experience;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are not reliant on financial leverage to generate returns;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

12




● | are at the point in their lifecycle at which going public is a natural next step; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | will offer an attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

We do not intend to pursue an acquisition in the natural resources or energy industries, including the upstream, midstream and energy services sub-sectors.
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. While we have used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating opportunities such as our pending Business Combination with GBT, we may decide to enter into an initial business combination with another target business that only meets some but not all of these criteria and guidelines. In the event that we do not consummate the pending Business Combination with GBT and decide to enter into our initial business combination with another target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials that we would file with the SEC.
Initial Business Combination
The rules of the NYSE require that we must consummate our initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
If we do not consummate the pending Business Combination with GBT, we may also pursue an acquisition opportunity jointly with our sponsor, Apollo, or one or more of its affiliates, one or more Apollo Funds and/or investors in the Apollo Funds, which we refer to as an “Affiliated Joint Acquisition.” Any such parties may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities. Any such issuance of equity or equity-linked securities would, on a fully diluted basis, reduce the percentage ownership of our then-existing shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our Class B ordinary shares, issuances or deemed issuances of Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities would result in an adjustment to the ratio at which Class B ordinary shares will convert into Class A ordinary shares such that our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 20% of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon completion of the Initial Public Offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination), unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to such issuance or deemed issuance at the time thereof. Neither our sponsor nor Apollo, nor any of their respective affiliates, have an obligation to make any such investment, and may compete with us for potential business combinations.

13



We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, including an Affiliated Joint Acquisition as described above. However, we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target sufficient for the post-transaction company not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% of net assets test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for seeking shareholder approval or for purposes of a tender offer, as applicable.
After consideration of the factors identified and discussed in the section of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus captioned “APSG’s Board’s Reasons for Approval of the Business Combination,” including the financial analysis of GBT conducted by APSG and its advisors generally used to approve the transaction, our board of directors determined that GBT had a fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions held in the trust account and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of execution of the Business Combination Agreement.
Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets
Certain members of our management team and directors, including those who are affiliated with Apollo have fiduciary duties or are subject to contractual obligations or policies and procedures that require them to present business opportunities that may be appropriate for one or more entities, including Apollo Funds, to the respective investment committees of such entities or funds prior to presenting such opportunities to us regardless of the capacity in which they are made aware of such opportunities. This may impede our ability to acquire a target business that would be attractive to us. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both us and another entity, including any Apollo entity, about which any member of our management team or director acquires knowledge and we will waive any claim or cause of action we may have in respect thereof. We cannot guarantee that any opportunity that would be suitable for us will not be pursued by another entity, including Apollo or an Apollo Fund, or that any opportunity that is passed upon by such other entity will be referred to us in a timely manner or at all.
Apollo, together with its clients, engages in a broad range of business activities and invests in a broad range of businesses and assets. Apollo takes into account interests of its affiliates, clients and each of their respective portfolio companies (including reputational interests, financial interests, confidentiality concerns, legal, regulatory, tax and any other interests or considerations that arise from time to time) when determining whether to pursue (or how to structure) a potential transaction or investment opportunity. As a result, it is possible that Apollo may choose not to refer a business opportunity to us or that members of our management or directors who are affiliated with Apollo may choose not to pursue an opportunity notwithstanding that such opportunity would be attractive to us due to the reputational, financial, confidentiality, legal, regulatory, tax and/or other interests or considerations of Apollo, its affiliates, its clients and their respective portfolio companies.

14



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
As discussed herein and in “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance—Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she is required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us.
Status as a Public Company
We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer GBT, and if the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, any other target businesses, an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their ordinary shares in the target business for Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, GBT or if the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, any other target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe such business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests and the ability to use its equity as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
Financial Position
With funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of up to $788,221,650, after payment of $28,588,350 of deferred underwriting commissions, before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Effecting our Initial Business Combination
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our pending Business Combination with GBT using the sources discussed under “—GBT Business Combination.” If the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, we intend to effectuate any other initial business combination, using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.

15



If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of our assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire an interest in the target sufficient for the post-transaction company not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for current investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our business combination.
After consideration of the factors identified and discussed in the section of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus captioned “APSG’s Board’s Reasons for Approval of the Business Combination,” including the financial analysis of GBT conducted by APSG and its advisors generally used to approve the transaction, our board of directors determined that GBT had a fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions held in the trust account and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of execution of the Business Combination Agreement.
To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.

16



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a disciplined due diligence review of issues that we deem important to validating a company’s business quality and assessing growth and value creation opportunities, allowing our management team to price returns relative to potential risks appropriately. This review may encompass, among other things, research related to the company’s industry, markets, products, services and competitors, meetings with incumbent management and employees, on-site visits and a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
If the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, the time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, will not be currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company may pay underwriting discounts and commissions, placement agent fees, initial purchaser fees or discounts, finder’s fees, arrangement fees, commitment fees and transaction, structuring, consulting, advisory and management fees and similar fees or other compensation to Apollo, our sponsor, our directors, members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we intend to focus our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the management of GBT, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination
If the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, we may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote in connection with another initial business combination, pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons.
Under the NYSE’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:

● | we issue (other than in a public offering for cash) ordinary shares that will either (a) be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of Class A ordinary shares then outstanding or (b) have voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power then outstanding;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial securityholders (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired and if the number of ordinary shares to be issued, or if the number of ordinary shares into which the securities may be convertible or exercisable, exceeds either (a) 1% of the number of ordinary shares or 1% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any of our directors and officers or (b) 5% of the number of ordinary shares or 5% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any substantial securityholders; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other than if effected by a merger under Companies Act (as amended) of the Cayman Islands (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “Companies Act”), which would require the passing of a shareholders’ special resolution, the Companies Act and Cayman Islands law do not currently require, and we are not aware of any other applicable law that will require, shareholder approval of our initial business combination.
The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:

● | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other time and budget constraints of the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases of our Securities
We are seeking shareholder approval of our pending Business Combination with GBT. In the event that the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated and we conduct redemptions in connection with another proposed business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial shareholders, Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and the rules of the NYSE. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights.
In the event that our initial shareholders, sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
Our initial shareholders, sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our initial shareholders, sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the class of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the shareholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.

Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination
As discussed in our Proxy Statement/Prospectus, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares in connection with our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us as permitted withdrawals, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein (such redemption, the “APSG Share Redemption”). The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Class B ordinary shares held by them and any public shares held by them in connection with our initial business combination (the “letter agreement”).
Limitations on Redemptions
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that in no event will we redeem our Class A ordinary shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, the proposed business combination may require (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
As discussed in our Proxy Statement/Prospectus, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target business in a manner that requires shareholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a shareholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other legal reasons.
If we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above.

20



If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of our outstanding ordinary shares representing a majority of the voting power of all of our outstanding ordinary shares entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial shareholders will count toward this quorum and have agreed to vote their Class B ordinary shares and any public shares purchased in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding ordinary shares voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ Class B ordinary shares, we would need 30,630,376, or 37.5%, of the 81,681,000 public shares sold to be voted in favor of a transaction (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our initial business combination approved. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial shareholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into the letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Class B ordinary shares and any public shares held by them in connection with our initial business combination.
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will:

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any shareholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NYSE listing or Exchange Act registration.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon the public announcement of our business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Shareholder Approval
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination.

21



Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
Public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” are required to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials (as applicable) mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials (as applicable) that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the shareholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination.
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different during the remainder of the completion window (as defined below).
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we have until 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering but have not completed our initial business combination within such 24-month period (the “completion window”) to complete our initial business combination, including the pending Business Combination with GBT. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the completion window, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to make permitted withdrawals (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window.

22



Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into the letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any Class B ordinary shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window. However, if our sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window.
Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within the completion window or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to make permitted withdrawals, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. Pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, such an amendment would need to be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 65% of all then outstanding ordinary shares.
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from cash held outside of the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.
However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not used to make permitted withdrawals, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.

23



Although we will seek to have all vendors (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent public accountants) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share.
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to approximately $2,000,000 from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.

24



If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the completion window, subject to applicable law, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within the completion window or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash in connection with our initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.
Certain Potential Conflicts of Interest
Under Cayman Islands law, directors owe fiduciary duties to the company including the following:

● | duty to act in good faith in what the director believes to be in the best interests of the company as a whole;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | duty to exercise authority for the purpose for which it is conferred;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | directors should not improperly fetter the exercise of future discretion;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | duty not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal interests; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | duty to exercise independent judgment.
--+---------------------------------------

In addition to the above, directors also owe a duty of care which is not fiduciary in nature. This duty has been defined as a requirement to act as a reasonably diligent person having both the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by that director in relation to the company and the general knowledge skill and experience which that director has.
As set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing, or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance by the shareholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of permission granted in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by shareholder approval at general meetings.

Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Certain members of our management team and directors who are affiliated with Apollo have fiduciary duties or are subject to contractual obligations or policies and procedures that require them to present business opportunities that may be appropriate for one or more Apollo Funds to the respective investment committees of such funds prior to presenting such opportunities to us regardless of the capacity in which they are made aware of such opportunities. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity, including an Apollo entity, to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such other entity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both us and another entity, including any Apollo entity, about which any member of our management team or director acquires knowledge and we will waive any claim or cause of action we may have in respect thereof. In addition, we may pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with an entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by borrowing from or issuing to such entity a class of equity or equity-linked securities. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination.
Apollo manages a significant number of Apollo Funds. Apollo and its affiliates, as well as Apollo Funds, may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. If these entities or companies decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from procuring such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within Apollo may be suitable for both us and for Apollo affiliates and/or current or future Apollo Funds and may be directed to such affiliates and/or Apollo Funds rather than to us. Neither Apollo nor members of our management team who are also employed by Apollo have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware. Apollo and/or our management, in their capacities as partners, officers or employees of Apollo will be, or in their other endeavors may be, required to present potential business combinations to other entities, before they present such opportunities to us.
In addition, Apollo and its affiliates and/or Apollo Funds, including our officers and directors who are affiliated with Apollo may sponsor or form other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination, and members of our management team may participate in such blank check companies. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among the management teams.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with any affiliates of Apollo or investors in the Apollo Funds. In addition, we may pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with an entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Such entities may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by borrowing from or issuing to such entity a class of equity or equity-linked securities.
Potential investors should also be aware of the following other potential conflicts of interest:

● | None of our officers or directors is required to commit his or her full time to our affairs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating his or her time among various business activities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. Our management may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.

● | Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Class B ordinary shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. Additionally, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Class B ordinary shares held by them if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the completion window. If we do not complete our initial business combination within such applicable time period, the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants held in the trust account will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, and the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. Furthermore, our initial shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any Class B ordinary shares held by them until one year after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination or earlier if, subsequent to our initial business combination, (i) the last sale price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination or (ii) we consummate a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. With certain limited exceptions, the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A ordinary shares underlying such warrants will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. Since our sponsor and officers and directors may directly or indirectly own ordinary shares and warrants following the Initial Public Offering, our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination.

● | Our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our sponsor or any of its affiliates may make additional investments in the company in connection with our initial business combination, although our sponsor and their affiliates have no obligation to do so. Apollo and its affiliates and certain of the Apollo Funds engage in the business of originating, underwriting, syndicating, acquiring and trading loans and debt securities of corporate and other borrowers, and may provide or participate in any debt financing arrangement in connection with any acquisition, financing or disposition of any target business that we may make. If our sponsor or any of its affiliates elect to make additional investments or provide financing, such proposed transactions could influence our sponsor’s motivation to complete our initial business combination.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our sponsor, officers or directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a business combination and financing arrangements as we may obtain loans from our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or any of our officers or directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period.

The conflicts described above may not be resolved in our favor.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Apollo, our sponsor, officers or directors or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
Apollo, our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, may serve as a finder or provide other services for which they may be paid underwriting discounts and commissions, placement agent fees, initial purchaser fees or discounts, finder’s fees, arrangement fees, commitment fees and transaction, structuring, consulting, advisory and management fees and similar fees by the company for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Further, commencing on the date our securities are first listed on the NYSE, we pay an amount equal to $16,667 per month, for up to 27 months, to our sponsor for office space, utilities, secretarial support and administrative services provided to us.

In the event that we submit our initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. Our initial shareholders have agreed to vote any Class B ordinary shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination and our officers and directors have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of our initial business combination.
Sponsor Indemnity
Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent public accountants) for services rendered or products sold to us, or by a prospective target business with which we have entered into a letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn in permitted withdrawals. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
Facilities
Our executive offices are located at 9 West 57th Street, 43rd Floor, New York, NY 10019, and our telephone number is (212) 515-3200. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $16,667 per month, for up to 27 months, we pay to our Sponsor for office space, utilities, secretarial support and administrative services.
Human Capital Management
We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that they will devote in any time period will vary based on the stage of the business combination process we are in.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
Our Units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains such reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials (as applicable) sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), or reconciled to, GAAP, or the international accounting standards board (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that any applicable requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.

28



We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and to have our internal control procedures audited. GBT is not and any other target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
Legal Proceedings
There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.
