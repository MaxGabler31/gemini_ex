Item 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
We are a global gaming technology company which owns and operates a betting software designed with a unique “distributed model” architecture colloquially named Elys Game Board (the “Platform”) through our subsidiary, Odissea Betriebsinformatik Beratung GmbH (“Odissea”). The Platform is a fully integrated “omni-channel” framework that combines centralized technology for updating, servicing and operations with multi-channel functionality to accept all forms of customer payment through our distribution channels described below. The omni-channel software design is fully integrated with a built in player gaming account management system, built-in sports book and a virtual sports platform through our subsidiary, Virtual Generation Limited (“Virtual Generation”). The Platform also provides seamless application programming interface integration of third-party supplied products such as online casino, poker, lottery and horse racing and has the capability to incorporate e-sports and daily fantasy sports providers.
 
We believe that our Platform is considered one of the newest betting software platforms in the world and our plan is to expand our Platform offering to new jurisdictions around the world on a business-to-business (“B2B”) basis, including expansion through Europe, South America, South Africa and the developing market in the United States. We also generate service revenue from royalties through authorized agents by providing our virtual sports products through our Virtual Generation subsidiary and generated service revenues through the provision of bookmaking and platform services through our recently acquired subsidiary, Bookmakers Company US, LLC d/b/a U.S. Bookmaking (“US Bookmaking”). We intend to leverage our partnerships in these countries to cross-sell our Platform services to expand the global distribution of our betting solutions.
 
The Platform is certified by the Agenzia delle Dogane e dei Monopoli (“ADM”), the Malta Gaming Authority (“MGA”) in Malta and Gaming Laboratories International (“GLI”) and is owned by our Odissea subsidiary. The software architecture was developed and built on the latest Microsoft.Net Core framework, supporting both online customer gaming accounts as well as land-based bet processing capability with multi-channel functionality accepting all forms of payment methods (i.e., cash, e-wallet, bank card and wire transfer, etc.) backed by a real-time customer relationship management (“CRM”) and business intelligence (“BI”) program for streamlined cross-platform marketing as well as a synchronized financial accounting processes. Data is communicated directly to on-the-ground sales and marketing agents that manage and maintain both our online and land-based retail distribution. The Platform allows our independent B2B customers to (i) rapidly and effectively model their gaming businesses and manage gaming accounts, (ii) monitor and analyze performance on an ongoing basis, (iii) share dashboards, and (iv) generate management reports all within a fully integrated solution. In addition, our clients can use the built-in business intelligence modules to evaluate actual performance and leverage insights from analytics to make informed, timely decisions to drive future business. The unique ’shop-client’ architecture of the Platform is to our knowledge a one-of-a-kind solution in the leisure betting industry. Elys was built around the specific needs of leisure betting operators and proven through our existing Multigioco distribution throughout Italy.
 
Our intention is to focus our attention on developing and expanding the U.S. market. We currently provide gaming services in the U.S. market on a B2B basis via our recently acquired subsidiary , US Bookmaking, in certain licensed states where we offer bookmaking and platform services to our customers and recently expanded our operations is Washington, D.C. through a Class B Managed Service Provider and Class B Operator license to operate a sportsbook within the Grand Central Bar and Grill located in the Adams Morgan area of Washington, D.C., and have recently entered into an agreement to provide services with another location in Washington, D.C. In addition, in March 2022 we commenced operations with Ocean Resort Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Our penetration into the U.S. market is significant as we have demonstrated that we can provide our bookmaking and platform services to both smaller retail locations and large casino operators using the same technology and platform base for all potential customers with minimal modification required to our operating systems and bookmaking services, which is extremely cost effective.
 
We provide our gaming services in Italy through our subsidiary, Multigioco Srl (“Multigioco”), which operations are carried out via both land-based or online retail gaming licenses regulated by the ADM that permits us to distribute leisure betting products such as sports betting, and virtual sports betting products through both physical, land-based retail locations as well as online through our licensed website www.newgioco.it or commercial webskins linked to our licensed website and through mobile devices. Our Austria Bookmaker license that was regulated by the Austrian Federal Finance Ministry (“BMF”) permitted us to operate online sports betting in certain European jurisdictions through our subsidiary, Ulisse GmbH (“Ulisse”), under the free-trade principles incorporated within bilateral Intra-EU trade agreements that refers to all trade, including e-commerce transactions in most goods, services and products between member states of the European Union (“EU”). Since the majority of Ulisse Data Transmission Centers (CTD) locations were not expected to re-open after the COVID-19 related lockdowns in Italy subsided, management decided to simplify our Italian footprint by focusing our investment towards the Multigioco operations and discontinued Ulisse presence in Italy during Q2-2021. Management decided during the fourth quarter of 2021 to focus all of its attention and technical resources on developing the significant opportunities and new business leads in the U.S. market. After careful consideration of the potential of developing gaming operations in the Austrian and other European markets, management decided to let the Austrian license lapse, which resulted in a license impairment charge of $4,827,914.

In Italy, our gaming products and services are offered to customers throughout the following three distribution channels:
 

· | Online gaming websites or mobile solutions where players, through an online account and an e-wallet, using the internet, can play online poker, online casinos games, sports betting wagers, play i-lottery games etc.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Punti Virtuali di Ricarica (“PVR”) (translated as Virtual Reload Centers) or Web-shop (“web cafe” or “internet cafe”): A PVR or web-shop is a physical location that is operated by third-party independent businesses that promote our online gaming websites, acquires online customers and via manned or self-service automated terminals permit online-players to make cash deposits that are electronically credited to their personal online gaming accounts. While at the PVR online-players could also play games and wager through their personal online account by using the public internet accessing communal PC’s available at the venue.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Corner or Punto Sportivo (translated as Sporting Point-of-sale): A corner is distinguished from an agency insofar as the principal business situated at the location that is operated by third-party independent businesses and is an activity that is primarily different from gaming (such as a coffee shop or convenience store) with a terminal connected to the ADM network. The primary purpose of such facility is not gaming, but rather, there is only a small ‘corner’ for extra cash flow in exchange for a fee and/or commission. Specifically, a maximum of 30% of floor space of a corner location can be dedicated to gaming where gaming transactions are collected and processed by a counter clerk.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We currently service approximately 100,000 online user accounts and an indeterminate number of walk-in customers at a combination of the three types of venues: approximately 1,300 web-shops, 8 corners and 1 land based shop.
 
Our corporate group is based in North America, which includes an executive suite situated in Las Vegas Nevada and a Canadian office in Toronto, Ontario through which we carry-out corporate activities, handle day-to-day reporting and U.S. development planning, and through which various employees, independent contractors and vendors are engaged.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, transaction revenue generated through our subsidiaries Multigioco and Ulisse consisted of wagering and gaming transactions income broken down to: (i) spread on sports bet wagers, and (ii) fixed rate commissions on casino, poker, lotto and horse racing wagers from online based betting web-shops and websites as well as land-based retail betting shops located throughout Italy; while our service revenue generated by our Platform is primarily derived from bet and wager processing through Multigioco and Odissea.
 
In the USA we operate as a B2B, the same as the “Corner or Punto Sportivo”. We are licensed to operate in several regulated states including Washington, D.C. (District of Columbia) and New Jersey. The locations oversee the wagers and paying out winnings and use our technology and support for the bookmaking services and our operating platform. We earn revenue generated from the use of the Platform as well as a share of the Net Gaming Revenue (NGR).
 
Organizational Structure
 
Our operations are carried out through three geographically organized groups: (i) operational groups based in Europe and administrative offices headquartered in Rome, Italy and satellite offices for operations administration and risk management trading in Naples and Teramo, Italy and San Gwann, Malta, as well as Las Vegas, Nevada for U.S. operations; (ii) a technology group which is based in Innsbruck, Austria and manages software development, training and administration; and (iii) a corporate group which is based in North America and maintains an executive suite in Las Vegas, Nevada and a Canadian office in Toronto, Ontario through which we carry-out corporate activities, handle day-to-day reporting and U.S. development planning, and through which various employees, independent contractors and vendors are engaged.
Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to expand our market presence by expanding our penetration into the U.S. market, entering new foreign markets while at the same time further penetrating the Italian and additional European markets. We expect the U.S. market and other new markets, such as Canada and Africa, to be a large source of our future growth, in particular, the U.S. market is one where we intend to offer the use of our Platform to existing commercial and tribal casinos, retail betting operators and franchise enterprises.

Our Strengths
 
We believe we have established ourselves as one of the leaders in the Italian leisure betting market. Below are our strengths that we believe should enable us to capture a meaningful share of the United States and global leisure betting market:

Highly Differentiated Technology Platform. Built from the ground-up,
the Platform is designed to be a highly flexible and robust sportsbook engine able to cope with the demands of today’s betting
operators and players. The Platform is an industry designed, user centric multi-channel solution and can offer any type of sport
(or non-sport) event and any type of betting market (i.e., soccer, football, basketball, hockey, baseball, tennis, etc.) in both
pre-match and in-game modes across both fixed-odds (player versus bookie) and pool (player versus player) styles and manage the
risk for each individual transaction through all verticals (i.e., online or land-based). Our proprietary Platform is designed to
address the independent operator’s ability to compete against larger and more established franchise operators effectively
and inexpensively. It is designed also to monitor, evaluate and permit the risk management of each bet transaction at each location
from which a bet is placed.


Market Momentum. We believe that our unique multi-channel designed
Platform is gaining momentum in the Italian leisure betting market also thanks to our comprehensive retail shop-client application
with integrated gaming account management functionalities and business intelligence modules. We currently have approximately 100,000
online user accounts and an indeterminate number of walk-in customers through the three existing distribution channels: mobile/desktop
web sites, 1,000 web-cafés (or “web-shops”), and 7 corners.


Scalable Platform at Minimal Cost. Our Platform is highly scalable.
Expansion of the Platform under our existing infrastructure requires little additional overhead and should create in-house efficiencies
for our corporate operations and for our agents and operator clients. Many of the inherent functions and features of our ADM Platform
certification in Italy have received prior approval and adhere to multi-jurisdictional standards which in our view will enable
us to receive certification in new markets and expand into new markets in a timely manner.


Growing Industry. Online gambling is growing in popularity. Gamblers
worldwide increasingly prefer Internet and mobile channels for their betting activities due to the ease of access offered and safety
provided. Extensive usage of digital processes and growing bettor demand is driving the market for online betting platforms. Recent
liberalization and state-by-state legislation in the United States has resulted in new opportunities in the United States sports
betting market. We anticipate that the United States market will begin to have a strong and steady uptake in active wagers. As
of March 2022, twenty-six jurisdictions (including the District of Columbia) have some form of legal sports betting available.
Nine others, including Washington and North Carolina, have authorized legal sports betting but not yet launched their market.


Highly Experienced Senior Management Team. We are led by a dedicated
and highly experienced senior management team with significant industry experience and proven ability to develop novel solutions.
Each of the members of our senior management have more than 20 years of relevant experience.

Development of Foreign Markets
 
The North America Sports Betting Market.
 In the U.S., until 2018 the Interstate Wire Act of 1961 combined with the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (“PASPA” or the “Bradley Act”), prohibited sports betting in the U.S. in all but four grandfathered states (Montana, Oregon, Nevada, Delaware). In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned PASPA in a 6-3 decision that found the law conflicted with the Tenth Amendment leaving individual states to decide whether to allow its residents to bet on sports. As described below under the section “Developments in the U.S. Market”, many states, such as New Jersey, Montana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and others, have moved quickly to establish sports betting as a means to increase their respective capital resources. While several states have recently passed legislation to allow online gambling, we believe that the U.S. sports betting market will take 5 – 10 years to fully develop. We believe that the United States represents a large addressable market opportunity for us with our Elys betting Platform. Additionally, in Canada we are observing promising legislative developments and we expect a new digital gaming regulatory framework, combined with the permission of single-wagering sport betting events, to be in place soon. This additional jurisdiction could represent a meaningful opportunity for our gaming solution.

 Mergers and Acquisition in the Global Gaming Industry. 
 Mergers and Acquisition in the Global Gaming Industry. In an effort to scale and grow the business, we intend to evaluate potential acquisitions that can be easily integrated into our business. The global gaming industry is still very much fragmented. There have been a significant number of noteworthy consolidations such as: (1) The Stars Group/SkyBet (July 2018) and CrownBet/William Hill Australia (April 2018); (2) Paddy Power/Betfair (February 2016) and with Stars Group (April 2020); (3) GVC/BWIN Ladbrokes/Coral (March 2018), and (4) in gaming machine and lottery concentration (IGT/GTECH (April 2015); as well as others such as Pollard/Innova (July 2017); NYX Gaming Group/Scientific Games (January 2018), which we believe provide us with an opportunity to capitalize on the acquisition of smaller operators forced to compete against newly formed larger players. In addition to the above, and specifically in the U.S., we observed consolidations and acceleration of gaming operators acquiring sports betting technology providers like (1) DraftKings acquiring SBTech (April 2020; (2) Caesars Entertainment acquiring William Hill (September 2020); and (3) Bally’s Corporation acquiring Bet.Works (November 2020) which strengthens our position as one of few remaining, truly independent sport betting providers in the market.
Further Penetration in the Italian Market
 

· | Acquisitions of Smaller Operators.
--+-----------------------------------

 Government legislated consolidation of the regulated Italian lottery and gaming market have driven smaller regional operators in Italy to our licensed brand “New Gioco”TM in both the online and land-based sales channels. The Italian regulated gaming market is the largest in the EU and is extremely fragmented. Recent new regulations in Italy have made it more difficult for smaller regional operators throughout Italy to operate and we believe that our innovative and cost-effective Platform is an attractive alternative for such smaller regional operators throughout Italy that will not be able to maintain the new standards set out by the Italian regulator on their own.
 

· | Organic Growth.
--+----------------

 The Italian online gaming market continues to drive substantial growth in our core operations. From January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, we increased the number of registered online accounts to over 100,000 players and webshop locations we operate in Italy from approximately 1,200 to approximately 1,300 and believe that there is ample room for continued growth in the Italian market. 

Expansion and New Markets
 
Developments in the U.S. Market
 
In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court (“SCOTUS”) ruled that the PASPA was unconstitutional as it violated the Tenth Amendment prohibition against forcing states to implement federal laws. Enacted in 1992, PASPA generally prohibited states from authorizing, licensing or sponsoring betting on competitive games in which amateur or professional athletes participate. PASPA did not make sports betting a federal crime; rather, it allowed the attorney general for the Department of Justice, as well as professional and amateur sports organizations, to bring civil actions to enjoin violations of the act. The SCOTUS decision opens the door for all states to legalize and regulate sports gambling within their borders. States such as Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Montana, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Tennessee, New York, New Mexico, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, Michigan, Mississippi, Colorado and the District of Columbia have passed laws that were ready to be enacted once the federal ban on sports betting was lifted. In addition, additional states including Maine, California, Connecticut, Louisiana, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio and Maryland are considering active bills. 
 We believe that the U.S. sports betting and online gaming market presents a large opportunity to deploy our Platform on a business-to-business-to-consumer (“B2B2C”) basis to several potential independent commercial and tribal casino and gaming operators throughout the United States. In September 2020, our retail sports betting solution obtained Gaming Laboratories International (“GLI”) certification allowing our technology to be ready for deployment in the U.S. land-based gaming segment. Furthermore, we have analyzed the technical specifications checklist supplied by GLI to verify that coding in our online product meets the functional specifications set forth in the GLI-33 standards GLI’s technical standard for event wagering systems). We believe that our online Platform currently meets the majority of the GLI-33 certification standards and we expect to be in a position to send our digital software to GLI for certification in 2022. Upon obtaining GLI-33 certification and obtaining regulatory approvals to operate in the digital segment, we also expect to be well-positioned to commence processing online sports bets in the U.S. on a B2B2C basis through our Platform. 
 As part of our multi-year business growth strategy, during 2021 and 2020 we made significant investments for expansion into the U.S. market with the acquisition of US Bookmaking, the acquisition of operating licenses and customers in Washington, D.C. and New Jersey and GLI-33 certification of our Platform, professional services, trade show marketing and brand promotion to enter and then to build a foundation aimed at accelerating our U.S. expansion plans. To support these principal objectives, we initiated an ambitious investment strategy that is fundamental to the successful execution of our long-term business plan. These fundamental investments have resulted in short-term, non-recurring expenses related to key elements such as regulatory and policy requirements and establishing a centralized US-based headquarters.

On September 1, 2020, our Odissea subsidiary obtained ISO-27001:2013 certification for safety management. The process involved a detailed and formal compliance audit and independent testing of the Information Security Management System (ISMS) that now certifies Odissea to manage the security of sensitive third party information such as financial assets, legal and personal details.
 
Products and Services and Distribution Methods
 
Betting Platform
 
We believe that our Platform, engineered and launched by our software development team at Odissea, is a highly efficient, cutting edge betting Platform technology that supports the processing of online client gaming account protocols as well as land-based betting protocols with seamless multi-channel functionality accepting all forms of payment methods (i.e., cash, e-wallet, bank card and wire transfer, etc.) and integrated with a real-time CRM and Business Intelligence program for streamlined cross-platform marketing as well as a synchronized financial accounting process.
 
Payment channels for both deposit and withdrawals online are as set forth below:
 

· | Player indirect – meaning that the player makes a deposit indirectly to their gaming account through a licensed agent (such as a cash deposit to their gaming account at a web-shop counter (e-credit to player account)).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Player direct – meaning that the player makes a deposit directly to their own gaming account through one or more of the following methods: 


Credit card;
ATM/debit card;
Bank wire
Postal money order; and
E-wallet or e-credit transfer.

 
Payment channels for both play of wagers and settlement of winnings at the land-based or retail agency or corner counter is as follows:
 

· | Player direct – meaning that the customer pays for the wager in cash and accepted debit or credit cards.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We currently employ a customizable client-focused and cost-effective “hands-on” method, rather than a “general approach” to our Platform design with the goal of empowering our player-facing customers, agents and employees to enhance the players’ experience by allowing personalized dashboard design and customer care for all customer call-ins to our service agents. We believe that this strategy has been highly effective in the Italian retail betting market and has been instrumental in increasing our revenues, net earnings and player retention.
 
Gaming Product Offerings
 
Our online sales channel (websites and web-shops) in Italy offers a full suite of gaming products that can be played in both real-money or free-play modes which include:

· | Sports Betting: Considered the largest and most well-known industry segment offering both pre-match and live in-game betting events on a wide variety of sports.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Online Casino: includes the following: 


· | Traditional Online Slot Games: Automated (using random number generated (“RNG”)) casino games and slot machines.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Traditional Online Table Games: Table games such as roulette, blackjack and baccarat.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Poker: Texas Hold’em and Omaha in both cash and tournament formats. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Bingo and Skilled and Interactive Games: Games that are programmed with a random number generator to ensure constant fairness for all parties. These games include card games such as tresette (3 Sevens), scopa (Sweep) and briscola (Trump).
· | Virtual Sports Betting: Various computer generated sport and racing events that are programmed with an RNG 
· | Horse Racing: Live track horse racing events. 

 
Our land-based customer locations generally offer only sports betting, and may also carry virtual sports betting and horse racing in Italy.

Current Markets, Other Services and Facilities
 
In addition to complementing gaming offerings originally provided by our acquired operators with our Newgioco branding, we intend to add new products and services with the assistance of gaming specialists, software providers and market research professionals. We believe that we can generate additional revenues by establishing more marketing centers and web-shops in Italy and expand our services in restaurants, bars and other similar small businesses across the U.S.
 
In Italy, we currently service approximately 100,000 online user accounts and estimate that our online user base will continue to further increase based on projections of both organic growth and acquisitions of existing operators. In addition, we also service an indeterminate number of walk-in customers at our physical locations throughout the U.S. and Italy. Subject to licensing requirements in each state, we also expect to increase our penetration in the U.S. and other North American markets in 2022.
 
Our client’s range in age from ages 18 through 79 and are a mix of 70% male and 30% female. In addition, we separate our revenue source by (a) sports betting, (b) casino and card game betting and (c) poker. Our in-house analysis indicates that sports betting and casino games are more popular than poker and other card games among our customer base. Furthermore, sports betting is our most profitable revenue stream yielding the highest percentage of our gross gaming revenue at 52% of revenues, which is representative of industry metrics when measured by completed sports seasons on a year over year basis. Our second largest source of revenue is currently casino followed by poker. We anticipate a shift in revenue in the future and that our largest source of our future revenue growth will be from B2B2C, which is expected to have the highest gross margin followed by sportsbook, casino and poker.
 
Our internal analysis further indicates different gaming patterns among our male and female online users. Male players prefer sports-bets, while approximately 10% of them also explore casino and poker. Conversely, female players prefer casino and bingo while approximately 1% try our other games such as poker, sports-betting or lotteries.
 
Most of our users are currently located throughout Italy, with the highest concentrations in larger centers such as Rome and Naples.
 
We expect that users from any operators that we acquire will continue to utilize our services and anticipate that any operators we acquire will have existing revenues from users who frequent their establishments and venues or use their gaming websites. In addition to acquiring customers through the acquisition of operators, we intend to obtain additional licenses and pursue contracts and relationships with other operators that we believe will attract and secure new users as we increase our customer base globally.
 
Revenue Streams
 
Our revenue streams primarily consist of transactional income and service revenue.
 
In the U.S. we currently generate service revenue from providing our platform and bookmaking services on a B2B basis to retail locations and casino operators in the U.S. market, through our subsidiaries, Elys Gameboard Technologies, (“Gameboard”) and US Bookmaking. We also intend to expand our presence in the U.S. market and are considering expanding our operations to provide a digital solution to customers in the U.S. on a business-to-consumer (“B2C”) basis.
 
In Italy, we currently generate transactional revenue through collection of bets from sports wagering and gaming from online betting and land-based betting shops located throughout Italy through our subsidiary Multigioco. We also generate service revenue from providing our Platform services to third party operators on a B2B basis through our Odissea subsidiary.
 
As we increase our customer base in Italy, our handle in our Italian operations reached approximately $574 million by the end of 2020 and $842 million by the end of 2021. In addition, our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 included revenue generated by Gameboard consisting of a percentage of net gaming revenues and revenue generated by Virtual Generation consisting of royalties invoiced for the sale of virtual games through authorized agents. We generated revenue of approximately $45.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and approximately $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, substantially all of which was generated from revenue from operations or services provided in Italy. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net gaming revenues represented 97.7% and 99.6%, respectively, and platform and service revenue represented 2.3% and 0.4%, respectively, of revenue.

Gaming revenues
 
Revenues from sports-betting, casino, cash and skill games, slots, bingo and horse race wagers represent the gross pay-ins (also referred to as turnover) from customers less gaming taxes and payouts to customers. Revenues are recorded when the game is closed which is representative of the point in time at which we have satisfied our performance obligation. In addition, we receive commissions from the sale of scratch tickets and other lottery games. Commissions are recorded when the ticket for scratch off tickets and lottery tickets are sold.
 
Betting platform
 
Revenues from the Betting Platform include license fees, training, installation, and product support services. Revenue is recognized when transfer of control to the customer has been made and our performance obligation has been fulfilled. License fees are calculated as a percentage of each licensee’s level of activity and are contingent upon the licensee’s usage. The license fees are recognized on an accrual basis as earned.
 
Mobile Browser Application
 
Based upon customer demand for improved performance, speed, and ease-of-use for sports betting on mobile devices, we engaged a dedicated internal team of engineers to this distribution channel and have already launched and intend to continue to launch several new and innovative features.
 
Our next-generation mobile browser and application based betting solution on our Platform is constantly evolving and being customized for deployment in each specific country market. The mobile solution is dedicated to improving the user experience with respect to sports betting with a unique modular design that allows quick go-to-market with plug-and-play features, we have the ability to tailor the mobile app to each market, including specific look and feel features, while end users quickly get to the desired bet ticket with just a few clicks. The modular architecture design of our mobile platform includes features inherent in the leading-edge Material Design framework developed by GoogleTM in 2014. Material Design is a visual language that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation of technology and science allowing the flexibility to quickly create new layouts for a variety of both enterprise brands and chain store locations, private brands and applications to add other features such as loyalty rewards for restaurants and cruise lines, push marketing for customer acquisition and retention and importantly, the ability to offer both online and land-based betting distribution under a variety of gaming regulations.
 
Our Websites
 
In Italy, we own our branded URL (uniform resource locator) newgioco.it that we operate in accordance with the ADM GAD licensing requirements either directly or through white label websites with online customers, or alternatively, contract the websites to third party agents or promoters operating webskin URLs under the newgioco.it licensed website. Our licensed gaming website, newgioco.it, currently processes live and virtual sports bets and mobile sports betting transactions through our Platform, while online casino and poker are provided under a third-party service provider agreement with Microgame SpA, and lotto products are provided by Lottomatica SpA.
 
Our gaming websites are tailored for the Italian market and Odissea provides and operates all aspects of our online gaming websites including servers, routers, software development, sportsbook trading, telephone betting, licensing, website hosting, payment solutions, security, and gaming related customer support needs.
 
The branded website newgioco.it serves both players directly and web-shops (i.e., internet café’s) through the online channel of our Platform. There are some variations in website style because we offer different services through distinctive marketing campaigns:
 

newgioco.it is mainly devoted to marketing for shops, including marketing
with respect to campaigns, branding, and proposals/marketing for prospective operators to become a “Newgioco shop”
and is the landing page for all white-label websites. A landing page refers to a webpage that is generally owned by a promoter
(which can also be referred to as a betting shop) which redirects their marketing (social network, friends or other forms of marketing)
to this main webpage. Apart from a few advertisements, the landing page links patrons to sign-up or register directly on the newgioco.it
main page except that a promotional code is tied to the link, such that the web promoter can funnel its marketing through a subnet.
In the case of Italy, the entire subnet (a subnet is a logical grouping of connected network devices; nodes on a subnet tend to
be located in close physical proximity to each other such as on a LAN) must be connected to the ADM network (and all games offered
through the network) must be certified and approved by SOGEI (an entity authorized to conduct such certification and approval by
the Italian Ministry of Finance).

Our newgioco.it website offers wagering in many categories of sports events. We intend to capture a larger share of the Italian sports betting market by focusing on the Serie A, Serie B, and Serie C soccer matches as well as virtual sports betting, online poker, online casino and slots, skill games, and Italian horse racing through agent-based sales campaigns.
 
Our direct sales campaigns aimed at end users and agent-based sales campaigns are offered through white-label pages or webskins that direct gaming transactions through our licensed website newgioco.it. We currently operate eleven such webskins as follows:
 

● originalbet.it | ● timetobet.it 
-----------------+---------------------------
● lovingbet.it | ● quibet.it 
● tecknogame.it | ● fullmatchnew.it 
● clubgames.it | ● newbetlive5k.it 
● gamesmart.it | ● guadagnomatematicobet.it
● 782xbet.it | 

 
Webskins or white-label pages are dedicated to the end-user, or player, and focus on regional campaigns and gaming offerings directed at local players, such as welcome bonuses, poker rake rebate for poker players, etc. A white-label page is a complete gaming website (similar to the main website of the licenser (in our case Multigioco)) but with the interface and logo of the promoter. The promoter earns fees based on a percentage of the handle (turnover) generated through their website.
 
In relation to the third-party websites, the promoter (“partner”, “shop”, “agent” or “promoter”) is responsible for marketing strategies, administration and costs. The promoter may utilize special promotions, draws and incentives to drive players to their website to increase gaming handle (turnover) or visits. Generally, these regional promoters operate in areas that are remote or distant from our central operations based in Rome. Therefore, some promotions may be tied to local events in the jurisdictions surrounding the “home base” of the promoter rather than originating from our main operations. The relationship with local shops and players from the promoter region remains with the promoter since there may be regional nuances that attract their clientele to our gaming offerings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the gaming business is owned by the underlying licensor (i.e., Multigioco) and is included in our overall financial results as gaming handle (turnover).
 
The promoter does not have direct access to our client gaming accounts and is therefore not legally responsible or liable for maintaining gaming account balances. Instead, the licensor is legally responsible for compliance and client gaming account control such as anti-money laundering, know-your-client and minimum age restrictions, and is also required to ensure that all payouts due to players are credited to each players’ gaming account and are available to players within seven business days of the completion of the play.
 
In the Italian market, our websites are only published in Italian. We may include additional languages if we determine that such services are commercially viable and if we agree to pay the related development fees. We currently have plans to expand our websites to include additional languages in the future.
 
Although we have a diverse portfolio of product and service offerings through our websites, we intend to focus on creating in-house cost savings and synergies by undertaking strategic acquisitions of competing webskin operators and to operate them under our Newgioco branding. We intend to replicate our successful operational model developed in the regulated Italian market through the U.S. and into other international markets.
 
Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into, and does not form any part of, this Form 10-K. We have included our website address as a factual reference and do not intend it to be an active link to our website. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available free of charge through the investor relations page of our internet website as soon as reasonably practicable.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not own any patents or have any patent applications pending in Italy or any other jurisdiction. As a result of our acquisitions of Multigioco, Rifa and the gaming assets of Newgioco Srl, we obtained the rights to the domestic distribution brand known throughout Italy as New Gioco, and in July 2015, we obtained a trademark on the brand and logo for New Gioco. Our prior subsidiary Rifa was amalgamated into Multigioco with effect on January 20, 2020.
 
As a result of the acquisition of Odissea, we obtained the intellectual property and technical know-how behind our betting Platform.

We also have proprietary rights to a number of trademarks, service marks and trade names used in this Annual Report which are important to our business including “NewGioco”, “OriginalBet”, “LovingBet” and “Elys.”
 
Research and Development
 
We are continually updating the Platform and the products that we offer. We incurred expenses in the amount of approximately $2.0 million and $1.7 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively for research and development. We expect that expenses we incur for development and improving our betting software to be continuous recurring research and development expenses.
Industry Overview 
 
See the section entitled COVID-19 Update found elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our industry.
 
Overview of the US Gaming Market
 
In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the national ban on sports betting (PASPA) was unconstitutional, paving the way for states to enact laws authorizing sports gambling.
 
The future of sports betting in the United States remains very promising for future years. Despite the sudden COVID-related suspensions of nearly all sports from March to early summer of 2020, the first two years since the repeal of PASPA still saw growth for legal sports betting, both in terms of market expansion in legal states and new legislation paving the pathway to regulated sports betting in additional jurisdictions.
 
As of February 2022, twenty-six jurisdictions (including the District of Columbia) have some form of legal sports betting available. Nine others, including the states of Washington and North Carolina, have authorized legal sports betting but not yet opened their market. Larger markets such as California and Texas remain uncertain at this time.
 
Overview of the Italian Leisure Betting Industry
 
Leisure betting describes consumer entertainment products such as purchase of lottery tickets, scratch off tickets, sports betting and online casino, which customers play on a daily or regular basis.
 
Gambling has been culturally rooted since Roman times, and as such, Italian gaming laws are governed by a well-defined set of regulations which are considered to be some of the most advanced and robust regulations in the world. The ADM has created a barrier to entry into the gaming industry in Italy through its implementation of processes and regulations aimed at consolidating and reducing the number of licenses including, but not limited to, increased insurance requirements, increased minimum number of locations.
 
Overview of the Global Leisure Gaming Market
 
The easing of government regulations on sports betting is expected to be a primary growth driver for the global online gambling market. We believe that the tax revenue in addition to increase in employment opportunities derived from online gambling will motivate governments around the globe to legalize online gambling
 

The global online gambling market is gaining popularity in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) because online sports betting sites generate substantial revenues for governments. Their significant contribution to national revenues is encouraging several countries to legalize online gambling.
 
The global online gambling market is characterized by the presence of several vendors competing to gain market dominance. Some small vendors are operating only in specific product verticals such as casino and lottery, while other vendors are operating in multiple areas including poker and sports betting. The growth opportunity for these vendors is increasing due to the rise in the number of online gambling providers and improved access to the internet around the world, as well as the increase in the number of players.
 
15
 



Certain key vendors in the global online gambling market are:
 

● Bet 365 (Hillside Group); | ● bet-at-home.com; 
-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------
● The Stars Group (formerly Poker Stars); | ● GVC Holdings; 
● Paddy Power Betfair; | ● Ladbrokes Coral Group: 
(now merged with Stars Group); | (now merged with GVC Holdings); 
● DraftKings; | ● GAN Limited 
● 888 Holdings; | ● IGT/GTECH Lottomatica SpA, and 
● William Hill; | ● Kindred (Unibet Group). 

 
Other notable product vendors in the market also include Betsson, Gamenet/Intralot/Goldbet, Camelot Group, Genting UK, NetEnt, Playtech (acquired Snaitech), and Rank Group. See “Competition” below for additional information on major operators in Italy.
 
The sports betting segment is expected to grow with the increased popularity of global soccer sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup and ongoing global growth of cricket and rugby tournaments. In addition, online betting is popular in many sports events that take place around the globe including basketball, horse and greyhound racing, ice hockey, baseball, golf, tennis and American football. Sports betting is becoming more popular due to the expansion of wagering on these sports through online channels.
 
Competition
 
Competition in the leisure gaming industry is moderate with operators competing for customers in various geographic markets. These include online operations of “land- based” casino operators, poker rooms, sports/race books, bingo, skills games, lottery, betting exchanges as well as internet or web only based operators. The global reach of the internet together with the abundant supply of games and operators means that users can easily switch gaming platforms and operators, thereby increasing competition. Government and other regulations make it more difficult for operators to expand their footprint in certain markets leading to the consolidation of operators in such markets, while the easing of regulations in some markets has permitted more operators to expand to new marketplaces.
 
We compete with several private and publicly listed companies that provide land-based and/or online gaming, many of which have greater sources of financing, greater name recognition and have been engaged in the industry longer than we have. In addition, current land-based casino competitors, many of which have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and greater financial and other resources than us, may provide Internet gaming services in the future.
 
We face direct competition in Italy from established online gaming sites including:
 

Lottomatica S.p.A.: large gaming operating with a range of products
and services from online casinos, sport betting and gaming machines;
Snaitech: (recently acquired by Playtech) an Italian corporation that
deals with the management of betting odds and horse racing contests;
Sisal: (wholly owned by CVC Capital Partners) one of the oldest Italian
gaming companies offering Internet betting, lotteries, poker and casino, slots and arcade games;
GVC Holdings/BWIN: one of the largest online gaming companies in the
world focused primarily on sports betting, as well as online casino and poker;
Ladbrokes/Gala Coral Group/Eurobet: a UK based betting and gambling
company which was acquired by GVC Holdings in March 2018;
Bet365 (Hillside Media): a UK based online gambling company offering
sports betting, poker, casino, games, and bingo, as well as video streams of sporting events;
PaddyPower/Betfair (Flutter Entertainment): is a London Stock Exchange
listed company and a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The company is a bookmaking business created by the merger of Paddy Power
and Betfair, and operates under various brands including Betfair, Paddy Power, Sportsbet, TVG and FanDuel;
The Stars Group (PokerStars): a Canadian online gaming company formerly
known as Amaya Gaming Group produces and offers online gaming products and services including poker, casino and sportsbook through
its online gaming division, Stars Interactive under the brands PokerStars, PokerStars Casino, BetStars and Full Tilt Poker and
in May 2020, The Stars Group completed its merger with Flutter Entertainment;
888 Holdings: a multinational online gambling company which operates
several international gambling websites including 888casino (one of the oldest online casino websites); 888poker and 888bingo;
and
William Hill: a UK based bookmaker founded in 1934 is listed on the
London Stock Exchange and a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index operates an online sportsbook and offers online casino games, ‘skill
games’, online bingo and online poker. The company operates approximately 2,300 betting shops and employs over 16,000 people
worldwide.

Government Regulations
 
We conduct business in a number of jurisdictions, of which Italy has historically contributed the most significant recurring gaming revenue, while our Virtual Generation subsidiary operates as a vendor or supplier to the gaming industry in such other jurisdictions. We are subject to various government regulations in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in as set forth below. Current and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of regulated online and land-based gaming and wagering. Any noncompliance with the various laws and regulations that our operations are subject to may harm our business and results of operations.
United States
 
There is no federal United States legislation that explicitly addresses the legality of online gambling. However, there are several acts that impact online gambling.
 
The Federal Wire Act of 1961 makes the placing of sports bets over the telephone illegal. The Federal Wire Act of 1961 does not explicitly refer to online gambling, leaving its applicability to on online gambling open to interpretation.
 
The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (“UIGEA”) prohibits any person engaged in the business of betting or wagering from knowingly accepting payments related to unlawful bets or wagers transmitted over the Internet. While the UIGEA does not define online gambling as being illegal, the UIGEA instructs the U.S. Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to impose obligations upon financial institutions and other payment processors to establish procedures designed to block online gaming-related financial transactions. It also expressly requires Internet bets and wagers to comply with the law of the jurisdiction where the wagers are initiated and received (i.e., within state borders). As a result of the UIGEA we may not accept bets received by use of wire communications facilities, including telephones and computers, unless such bets originated and terminated in jurisdictions where such betting or wagering is legal.
 
In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (the “PASPA”) was unconstitutional as it violated the Tenth Amendment prohibition against forcing states to implement federal laws. Enacted in 1992, PASPA generally prohibited states from authorizing, licensing or sponsoring betting on competitive games in which amateur or professional athletes participate. PASPA did not make sports betting a federal crime; but rather, it allowed the attorney general for the Department of Justice, as well as professional and amateur sports organizations, to bring civil actions to enjoin violations of PASPA. The U.S. Supreme Court decision opens the door for all states to legalize and regulate sports gambling within their borders. States such as Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Montana, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Tennessee, New York, New Mexico, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, Michigan, Mississippi, Colorado and the District of Columbia have passed laws that were ready to be enacted once the federal ban on sports betting was lifted. In addition, additional states including Maine, California, Connecticut, Louisiana, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio and Maryland are considering active bills.
 
Italy
 
Italian operation of land-based and online gaming activities requires a license awarded by the ADM. The ADM is responsible for, among other things:
 

regulating games and enforcing relevant regulatory provisions;
issuing licenses, and supervising compliance by licensees;
monitoring the distribution of gaming services; and
collecting gaming taxes.

 
There are currently two main categories of licenses (land-based and online) issued or awarded by the ADM in three series:
 

Series 1 first issued by legal decree in 1992, renewed in 2009 under
the Abruzzo decree and are colloquially branded as “Monti” licenses, that expired in 2016 and are expected to be called
for renewal tender between 2021 and 2023;
Finance Act series which were awarded by tender in 2006 and are known
as “Bersani” Licenses that expired in 2016 and are expected to be called for renewal tender between 2021 and 2023;
and
New series Gioco a Distanza (Games at a Distance) (“GAD”)
issued by application process under the Comunitaria decree in 2010 expire in 2021 and are expected to be renewed through a license
tender auction.

 
17
 



The Monti and Bersani licenses provide distribution authorization to operate both Negozio Sportivo (agency) and Punto Sportivo (corner) land-based establishments as well as GAD online (web-based) distribution. Land-based Monti licenses and Bersani licenses are subject to and expected to be consolidated under a new decree at renewal auction which is expected to be called for renewal tender between 2022 and 2023, to match up with the limited number of Comunitaria Series GAD licenses which expired in 2021.
 
We currently hold, through our Multigioco subsidiary, three gaming licenses upon which our business is dependent: (i) a Bersani license, (ii) a Monti license, and (iii) a GAD license. Our Italian Bersani, Monti and GAD licenses are issued by the ADM. Each Italian license is typically valid for a term of nine years which can be terminated if we fail to comply with required regulations in each country. The renewal process for the Bersani license and Monti license, is a call to tender auction process held at the same time for all licensees approximately once every nine years with the highest bidders being awarded not only licenses but rights to operate a certain number of land-based locations. In addition, the maximum number of land-based license rights that any one operator may bid on at auction is 20% of the total market being auctioned.
 
Each of the Bersani and Monti land-based licenses allow us to offer specific gaming products through physical retail locations that require one license right per each physical location. The rights granted under the Bersani and Monti licenses are not fixed to any specific physical location and can be moved at the discretion of the licensee to any physical address so long as the physical address has a police issued municipal license (as prescribed by article 86, paragraph 3, of the Italian Unified Text of Public Security Law (TULPS)) to sell gaming products and so long as the physical locations meet the ADM requirements, most of which are zoning requirements that require that the location is situated at a minimum distance from schools, churches and ATM’s and banks. Multigioco currently holds one land-based Bersani license with seven corner location rights that was issued to it in 2006, and one land-based Monti license with three agency location rights that was issued to it in 2010. Each of the Monti and Bersani licenses held by Multigioco expired in 2016. Although both of these land-based “concession” series of licenses expired for all Italian licensed operators in 2016, the ADM has granted a letter of authority which permits us to continue our land-based operations in Italy until the government holds the next organized auction for the renewal of licenses, which is expected to take place between 2022 and 2023.
 
By extending the pre-2016 concession licenses, the ADM has instituted an environment that authorizes licensed Operators to continue operating until the next license renewal auction. In this regard, certain non-Italian, European-based operators have commenced civil proceedings in the European Court of Justice against the ADM’s efforts to prohibit access to the regulated Italian betting market by foreign operators. The outcome of these proceedings and the effect on our business in the Italian market are presently unknown.
 
Multigioco was awarded a Comunitaria Series GAD license by the ADM in 2011. The licenses provide Multigioco the right to:
 

offer gaming products that ADM authorizes for deployment in Italy through
online channels which include websites and apps displayed on a PC, tablet or mobile phone;
enter into licensing, joint venture and acquisition agreements with
shops and private enterprises as concessionaires that provide various local services such as convenience stores, bars, cafes, and
restaurants in Italy;
establish web cafe`s as permitted by the regulations enforced by the
ADM regional office within Italy; and
take such steps such as know your client (“KYC”) and anti-money
laundering controls (“AML”) that are deemed necessary to develop the business of regulated gaming in Italy.

 
An online account allows a player to fund an account through a variety of electronic payment channels such as credit cards, ATM/debit cards and bank wires. The GAD license allows us the opportunity to open an unlimited number of web-shops and to close any of the web-shops that we open in our sole discretion. We currently operate approximately 1,300 web-shops throughout Italy. Our GAD license expired on June 15, 2021 and can be renewed provided that we have not violated any regulations. Although we believe that we will be able to renew this license through a tender notice process, no assurances can be given that the renewal will be timely, if at all.
 
Our Italian licenses could also be terminated if we fail to comply with required regulations in Italy.
 
In addition, our software Platform has been certified for use in Italy in accordance with the ADM requirements by Quinel M. Limited, an international technology auditor that conducted an audit of the Platform in June 2017. The purpose of the certification is to prove the effectiveness and accuracy of communications between the supplier interface and the user/operator interface. Any updates to the software or changes to key functions that we implement, require recertification, for which there can be no assurance that our software will qualify.
 
As a result of ongoing proceedings in the European Court of Justice regarding the application of Italian regulation for wagering under the Intra-EU model since the past renewal date of June 30, 2016 the ADM has imposed a moratorium on the issuance of new sports betting licenses and standardization of regulations. In the interim, the ADM is delaying the Italian license renewal process and has temporarily instituted operating authorizations for pre-2016 concessions that allow operators, including Multigioco, to continue to operate until the next license renewal is announced and concluded. The outcome and duration of this process is presently unknown.

Ulisse held one Austrian bookmaker license that was issued in June 2018 which had no termination date but could be terminated or cancelled by the regulator if Ulisse had failed to comply with any regulations. In accordance with established inter-European business principles that permit the formation and operation of business within EU state members, we previously operated gaming websites and 110 CTD retail locations in Italy under our Austrian bookmaker license. All 110 CTD retails locations were closed for the greater part of 2020 due to the COVID-19 restrictions. Management decided during the fourth quarter of 2021 to focus all of its attention and technical resources on developing the significant opportunities and new business leads in the U.S. market. After careful consideration of the potential of developing gaming operations in the Austrian and other European markets, management decided to let the Austrian license lapse and acquired the Ulisse customer relationships through Multigioco, operating under the Multigioco licenses and platform.
 
United Kingdom and European Union
 
The United Kingdom and certain EU countries, such as Germany, France, Spain and Greece, have enacted online gaming laws and regulations. To the extent that we operate in any of these jurisdictions, our operations will need to be in compliance with the laws and regulations of such jurisdiction.
Additional Government Regulations
 
We are subject to general business regulations and laws which cover among others, taxation, virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing.
 
For a description of the risks associated with the licenses and their renewal see the Risk Factors. Our failure to successfully acquire the requisite number of location rights we desire at the renewal auction in Italy may adversely impact our business. In such event, we will most likely either acquire rights in the secondary market from someone selling rights they acquired at auction at prices which are typically higher than the auction prices of the ADM or open additional web-shops, which will be less expensive but also have lower profit margins than the land-based operations.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As a multinational company our business success is dependent upon our global workforce which spans five countries. As of December 31, 2021, we employed 1 person directly located in Canada, and 5 people in the United States and engaged 5 persons as independent contractors, while our subsidiaries Multigioco employed 46 full-time employees and 1 part time employee located in Italy, and approximately 11 independent contractors and sales agents, Odissea employed 18 full-time employees located in Austria, Ulisse employed 1 full-time employees and Virtual Generation employed 1 full time employees between Italy, Malta and its international offices. Approximately 19% of our employees are part of our technology team and 81% are involved in finance, general management and other administrative functions. In July 2021, we acquired US Bookmaking that has 16 employees based in Las Vegas, Nevada. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good. Although, management continually seeks to add additional talent to its work force, management believes that it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. Our recruitment programs are regionally focused, and hiring is done at a local level to ensure compliance with applicable regulations.
 
We also offer our employees a compensation packages with premier health and welfare programs for employees and family members. In addition, every employee is eligible for equity awards to share in the Company’s financial success. Our paid time off programs enable our workforce to enjoy personal time away from their job responsibilities.
 
In early March 2020, we implemented a safe work plan to protect the health of our employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including closing our administrative offices. We had encouraged most of our employees to work from home, and we implemented health and safety protocols in our administrative offices to ensure that we are ready for the safe return of our employees to our offices, in order to ensure the success of our employees during the shift to remote work, we developed training resources for managers to ensure they had the proper skills to lead remote teams and provided training to employees on how to be effective while working remotely.
 
Most of our employees have returned to our workplaces during the second and third quarter of 2021 as local government restrictions were eased. We allow employees to work from home where circumstances warrant it and anticipate that we will continue this policy in the foreseeable future.

COVID-19 Update
 
As a result of the global outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, on March 8, 2020 the Italian government issued a decree which imposed certain restrictions on public gatherings and travel, and closures of physical venues that included betting shops, arcades and bingo halls across Italy. Accordingly, we had temporarily closed all betting shop locations throughout Italy as a result of the decree until May 4, 2020. Subsequently, on March 10, 2020 the Italian government imposed further restrictions on travel throughout Italy as well as transborder crossings and had either postponed or cancelled most professional sports events which had an effect on the Company’s overall sports betting handle and revenues and negatively impacted the Company’s operating results.
 
On June 19, 2020 all land-based betting shops, including corner locations such as coffee shops throughout Italy temporarily reopened until November 2020 when the Italian government imposed new lockdowns that were lifted on June 14, 2021. The closing of physical betting shop locations did not affect our online and mobile business operations which has mitigated some of the impact. Due to the high percentage of vaccinations administered in Italy, we do not anticipate further severely restrictive lockdowns.
 
During Q2 2021, management decided to close our Ulisse operations in Italy due to the uncertainty at that time of the duration and scope of the COVID-19 outbreak, while focusing investments on growing our U.S. market and the more familiar Multigioco brand, the result of which management believes has reduced the complexity and improved the efficiency of our gaming operations in Italy.
