Item 1. Business
Overview



Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company,” “Citius” or “we”), headquartered in Cranford, New Jersey, is a late-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of first-in-class critical care products with a focus on oncology, anti-infectives in adjunct cancer care, unique prescription products and stem cell therapy. Our goal generally is to achieve leading market positions by providing therapeutic products that address unmet medical needs yet have a lower development risk than usually is associated with new chemical entities. New formulations of previously approved drugs with substantial existing safety and efficacy data are a core focus. We seek to reduce development and clinical risks associated with drug development, yet still focus on innovative applications. Our strategy centers on products that have intellectual property and regulatory exclusivity protection, while providing competitive advantages over other existing therapeutic approaches.



The Company was founded as Citius Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company, on January 23, 2007. On September 12, 2014, Citius Pharmaceuticals, LLC entered into a Share Exchange and Reorganization Agreement, with Citius (formerly Trail One, Inc.), a publicly traded company incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. Citius Pharmaceuticals, LLC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citius. On March 30, 2016, Citius acquired Leonard-Meron Biosciences, Inc. (“LMB”) as a wholly-owned subsidiary. LMB was a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of critical care products with a concentration on anti-infectives. On September 11, 2020, we formed NoveCite, Inc. (“NoveCite”), a Delaware corporation, of which we own 75% of the issued and outstanding capital stock. NoveCite is focused on the development and commercialization of its proprietary mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of acute respiratory disease syndrome (“ARDS”). On August 23, 2021, we formed Citius Acquisition Corp. (“Citius Acq.”) as a wholly-owned subsidiary in conjunction with the acquisition of I/ONTAK, which began operations in April 2022.



Since its inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, acquiring our proprietary technology, research and development, recruiting management and technical staff, and raising capital. We are developing five proprietary products: I/ONTAK, in-licensed in September 2021, a engineered IL-2 diphtheria toxin fusion protein, for the treatment of patients with persistent or recurrent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (“CTCL”); Mino-Lok, an antibiotic lock solution used to treat patients with catheter-related bloodstream infections by salvaging the infected catheter; Halo-Lido, a corticosteroid-lidocaine topical formulation that is intended to provide anti-inflammatory and anesthetic relief to persons suffering from hemorrhoids; Mino-Wrap, a liquifying gel-based wrap for reduction of tissue expander infections following breast reconstructive surgeries; and NoveCite, a mesenchymal stem cell therapy for the treatment of ARDS. We believe these unique markets for our products are large, growing, and underserved by the current prescription products or procedures.



Citius is subject to a number of risks common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry including, but not limited to, risks related to the development by Citius or its competitors of research and development stage products, market acceptance of its products that receive regulatory approval, competition from larger companies, dependence on key personnel, dependence on key suppliers and strategic partners, the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing and the Company’s compliance with governmental and other regulations.



I/ONTAK



Overview



In September 2021, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories SA, a subsidiary of Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. (collectively, “Dr. Reddy’s”), to acquire its exclusive license of E7777 (denileukin diftitox), a late-stage oncology immunotherapy for the treatment of CTCL, a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. E7777, an engineered IL-2-diphtheria toxin fusion protein, is an improved formulation of oncology agent, ONTAK®, which was previously approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of patients with persistent or recurrent CTCL. We have renamed E7777 as I/ONTAK although we refer to it as E7777 at times in this report.

Phase 3 Trial



A global, multicenter, open label single arm pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of patients with persistent or recurrent CTCL was initiated in 2013. Inclusion criteria for the study were to evaluate patients in advanced stage CTCL (Mycosis Fungoides or Sézary Syndrome), who received at least one prior CTCL therapy.



The pivotal trial was divided into two phases, a lead-in phase with 21 subjects that evaluated dose finding, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity, as well as assessing the Objective Response Rate (the “ORR”). An ORR is defined as a greater than 50% reduction in tumor burden.



The results of the lead-in study were:




● | 9 mcg/kg/dose for 5 consecutive days in 21-day cycles which was selected for the main phase of the study based on safety, tolerability, and efficacy data.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No new safety signals were identified compared to Ontak.
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | An ORR of 38.1% in the intent to treat population and 44.4% in the efficacy evaluable populations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The second phase to the pivotal trial was a 70-patient study administered at the 9 mcg/kg/dose rate for 5 consecutive days in 21-day cycles, The inclusion criteria was identical to the lead-in study and the primary objective was to evaluate the ORR.



According to the trial protocol, the treatment would be considered efficacious and demonstrate clinical benefit if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% exact confidence interval (CI) of the observed ORR exceeds 25.0%, as determined by the Independent Review Committee (IRC).



The results of the pivotal trial were:




● | The IRC determined the study achieved an ORR of 36.2%, 95% confidence interval (25.0%, 48.7%) (25 patients out of 69);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An Investigator Efficacy Analysis determined that the study achieved an ORR of 42.3%, 95% confidence interval (30.6%, 54.6%) (30 patients out of 71);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The FDA recently provided additional written comments indicating that their efficacy evaluation will be based on study results showing the lower limit of a 95% confidence interval to exceed a clinically relevant response rate (determined during its review of our BLA) which may be supported with data from the prior ONTAK study that led to ONTAK’s initial approval. In our trial, ORR will need to be supported by adequate magnitude of duration of response and an acceptable risk/benefit ratio; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Overall rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were consistent with published data of previously approved ONTAK. Most common adverse events included: nausea, fatigue, increased alanine aminotransferase, chills and peripheral oedema, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and infusion related reaction. No new safety concerns were identified.

Investigator Initiated Trials



We believe there is an opportunity in the field of immune-oncology and have undertaken two investigator-initiated trials to evaluate the potential safety and efficacy of E7777 for potential as an immune-oncology combination therapy.



A Phase 1 trial was initiated in June 2021 at the University of Minnesota, Masonic Cancer Center. This study is a single-arm non-randomized trial which has an estimated enrollment of 30 participants who will be administered E7777 prior to tisagenlecleucel Chimeric Antigen Receptor, (“CAR-T”) therapy. The Phase 1 study consists of two components: dose finding to establish a maximum tolerated dose (“MTD”) of E7777 in combination with CART-T Therapy, and a small extension component to provide an estimate of efficacy at that MTD.



A second Phase 1 Study was initiated in September 2022 at the University of Pittsburg Medical Center, Hillman Cancer Center. This study will be investigating the safety and efficacy of a combined regimen of pembrolizumab with T-regulatory cell depletion and E7777 in patients diagnosed with recurrent or metastatic solid tumors in the second line setting.

Regulatory Development



In the 1990’s, denileukin diftitox was developed at Boston University and the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”) in collaboration with Seragen, Inc. In 1999, Ontak® (denileukin diftitox) was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of persistent or recurrent CTCL with Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Ligand”) acquiring the marketing rights in that same year. In 2006, Eisai Co., Ltd. (“Eisai”) acquired the commercial rights to Ontak from Ligand.



In 2008, the FDA granted full approval to Ontak for CTCL.



In 2011, there was a commercial supply disruption due to manufacturing issues and a new formulation of denileukin diftitox was developed under the code name E7777. The FDA considered this a new product with a new IND being filed. In ensuing discussions, the FDA agreed to a development plan that included a single arm, open label study to conclude safety and efficacy of E7777 and a CMC development plan that demonstrates the new process results in a comparable drug product.



In 2011, the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development granted E7777 orphan drug designation status for the treatment of Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (“PTCL”). In 2013, the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development granted E7777 orphan drug designation status for the treatment of CTCL.



In 2013, the first patient was enrolled into the lead-in phase of the pivotal study for the E7777 U.S. CTCL clinical trial.



In 2014, commercial sales of Ontak were discontinued when the product was voluntarily withdrawn from the market due to manufacturing issues at the contract manufacturer.



In 2015, the last patient enrolled exited the lead-in phase of the E7777 U.S. CTCL clinical trial.



In March 2016, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (“DRL”) acquired the global rights to E7777 from Eisai, other than far east countries, with Eisai retaining the rights in those countries.



In June 2016, the first patient was enrolled in the Phase 3 pivotal study for E7777 CTCL in the U.S.



In March 2020, Eisai filed an NDA for E7777 in Japan for both CTCL and PTCL and in March 2021 received approvals in both CTCL and PTCL.



Patient enrollment for the Phase 3 Pivotal study of E7777 was completed in December 2021. In April 2022, we reported that the topline results from the Phase 3 trial were consistent with the prior formulation. Moreover, no new safety signals were identified. 



In September 2022, we filed a biologics license application (“BLA”) for E7777. In December 2022, we announced that the FDA had accepted the BLA.



Market Opportunity



CTCL’s are a heterogeneous subset of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas (“NHL”) of mature, skin-homing T-cells that are mainly localized to the skin. The most common types of CTCL are mycosis fungoides (“MF”) and primary cutaneous CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL), jointly representing an estimated 80–85% of all CTCL. Sézary Syndrome (“SS”), a very rare subtype (~2–5% of CTCL) characterized by diffuse inflammatory, often exfoliative, erythroderma and by leukemic and nodal involvement, displays a significant degree of clinical and biological overlap with MF and has long been considered a clinical variant of MF, although recent evidence suggests that it may be a separate entity. The rest is represented by extremely rare, generally more aggressive subtypes. In light of the overlap between MF and SS, and considering that many of the systemic therapy options for the two neoplasms are the same, some consider the treatment approach to MF and SS as if they were a single disease entity (MF/SS). However, some of the drugs currently in use, or in development, for MF/SS appear to be more effective in clearing different anatomical compartments (skin versus blood, for example) and therefore have differential efficacy in MF and SS.

Based on Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data from 2001–2007, the estimated incidence rate of MF/SS in the U.S. is 0.5/100,000 or about 2,500–3,000 new cases per year representing about 25% of all T-cell lymphomas.



The Company estimates that there are 30,000 – 40,000 patients living with CTCL in the U.S. with approximately 16,000 – 20,000 having mycosis fungoides. Of those, the Company further estimates that there are 10,000 patients with relapsed or refractory CTCL that require systemic therapy.



The Company also estimates that the addressable U.S. market is approximately $300,000,000 - $400,000,000 for patients with advanced stage relapsed or refractory CTCL.



Proposed Spinoff



In May 2022, we announced that we intend to split the Company’s assets into two separate publicly traded entities. We plan to form a new company focused on developing and commercializing I/ONTAK. Our other pipeline assets, including Mino-Lok, would remain at Citius. Citius would continue to trade on the Nasdaq exchange under its current ticker CTXR. The strategic action is intended to optimize organizational resources and investment capital to support the successful execution of each development program. The transactions are expected to be completed in calendar year 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including final approval from the Citius Board of Directors, regulatory approvals, and SEC filings. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the proposed transaction or that the transaction will be completed at all.



Mino-Lok®



Overview



Mino-Lok is a patented solution containing minocycline, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edetate), and ethyl alcohol, all of which act synergistically to treat and salvage infected central venous catheters (“CVCs”) in patients with catheter related bloodstream infections (“CRBSIs”). Mino-Lok breaks down biofilm barriers formed by bacterial colonies, eradicates the bacteria, and provides anti-clotting properties to maintain patency in CVCs.



The administration of Mino-Lok consists of filling the lumen of the catheter with 0.8 ml to 2.0 ml of Mino-Lok solution. The catheter is then “locked”, meaning that the solution remains in the catheter without flowing into the vein. The lock is maintained for a dwell-time of two hours while the catheter is not in use. If the catheter has multiple lumens, all lumens may be locked with the Mino-Lok solution either simultaneously or sequentially. If patients are receiving continuous infusion therapy, the catheters alternate between being locked with the Mino-Lok solution and delivering therapy. The Mino-Lok therapy is two hours per day for at least five days, usually with two additional locks in the subsequent two weeks. After locking the catheter for two hours, the Mino-Lok solution is aspirated, and the catheter is flushed with normal saline. At that time, either the infusion will be continued, or will be locked with the standard-of-care lock solution until further use of the catheter is required. In a clinical study conducted by MD Anderson Cancer Center (“MDACC”), there were no serum levels of either minocycline or edetate detected in the sera of several patients who underwent daily catheter lock solution with minocycline and edetate (“M-EDTA”) at the concentration level proposed in Mino-Lok treatment. Thus, it has been demonstrated that the amount of either minocycline or edetate that leaks into the serum is very low or none at all.



Phase 2b Results



From April 2013 to July 2014, 30 patients with CVC-related bloodstream infection were enrolled at MDACC in a prospective Phase 2b study. Patients received Mino-Lok therapy for two hours once daily for a minimum of five days within the first week, followed by two additional locks within the next two weeks. Patients were followed for one month post-lock therapy. Demographic information, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, therapy, as well as adverse events and outcome were collected for each patient. Median age at diagnosis was 56 years (range: 21-73 years). In all patients, prior to the use of lock therapy, systemic treatment with a culture-directed, first-line intravenous antibiotic was started. Microbiological eradication was achieved at the end of therapy in all cases. None of the patients experienced any serious adverse event related to the lock therapy.

The active arm, which is the Mino-Lok treated group of patients, was then compared to 60 patients in a matched cohort that experienced removal and replacement of their CVCs within the same contemporaneous timeframe. The patients were matched for cancer type, infecting organism, and level of neutropenia. All patients were cancer patients and treated at MDACC. The efficacy of Mino-Lok therapy was 100% in salvaging CVCs, demonstrating equal effectiveness to removing the infected CVC and replacing it with a new catheter.



The main purpose of the study was to show that Mino-Lok therapy was at least as effective as the removal and replacement of CVCs when CRBSIs are present, and that the safety was better, that is, the complications of removing an infected catheter and replacing with a new one could be avoided. In addition to having a 100% efficacy rate with all CVCs being salvaged, Mino-Lok therapy had no significant adverse events (“SAEs”), compared to an 18% SAE rate in the matched cohort where patients had the infected CVCs removed and replaced with a fresh catheter. There were no overall complication rates in the Mino-Lok arm group compared to 11 patients with events (18%) in the control group. These events included bacterial relapse (5%) at four weeks post-intervention, and a number of complications associated with mechanical manipulation in the removal or replacement procedure for the catheter (10%) or development of deep-seated infections such as septic thrombophlebitis and osteomyelitis (8%). As footnoted, six patients had more than one complication in the control arm group.

Phase 3 Trial



In November 2016, the Company initiated site recruitment for Phase 3 clinical trials. From initiation through the first quarter of 2017, the Company received input from several sites related to the control arm as being less than standard-of-care for some of the respective institutions. The Company worked closely with the FDA with respect to the design of the Phase 3 trial and received feedback on August 17, 2017. The FDA stated that they recognized that there is an unmet medical need in salvaging infected catheters and agreed that an open label, superiority design would address the Company’s concerns and would be acceptable to meet the requirements of a new drug application. The Company amended the Phase 3 study design to remove the saline and heparin placebo control arm and to use an active control arm that conforms with today’s current standard-of-care. Patient enrollment commenced in February 2018.

The Mino-Lok Phase 3 Trial was originally planned to enroll 700 patients in 50 participating institutions, all located in the U.S. There were interim analyses at both the 50% and 75% points of the trial as measured by the number of patients treated. As of November 30, 2022, there are 18 active sites in the United States currently enrolling patients including such academic centers as MDACC, Henry Ford Health Center, Georgetown University Medical Center, and others.



In May 2022, the Company selected Biorasi, LLC (“Biorasi”), a global clinical research organization (CRO), to help expand the Company’s Phase 3 Mino-Lok trial by implementing additional sites outside the United States. There currently are 17 sites selected in India, making a total of 35 participating Mino-Lok institutions globally.



In September 2019, the Company announced that the FDA agreed to a new primary efficacy endpoint of “time to catheter failure” in comparing Mino-Lok to the antibiotic lock control arm. This change in the trial design reduced the required patient sample size of the trial from 700 subjects to approximately 144 available subjects to achieve the pre-specified 92 catheter failure events needed to conclude the trial. Additionally, the Company submitted a response to the FDA that it would implement this change in the primary endpoint and expected it to result in less than 150 subjects needed in its Phase 3 trial. The new primary endpoints require that the time to catheter failure be at least 38 days for Mino-Lok versus 21 days for the standard of care antibiotic locks.



In October 2019, the FDA agreed that the patient sample size of approximately 144 patients was acceptable.



In October 2019, the Company announced that the Phase 3 trial had reached the 40% completion triggering an interim futility analysis by the data monitoring committee (the “DMC”). The DMC is an independent panel of experts that review progress regarding the safety and efficacy of drugs in clinical trials, and to determine if the trial may be futile in achieving its endpoints or if the trial should be modified in any way.



In December 2019, the DMC convened and recommended that the trial continue with no changes because the analysis showed a positive outcome, as it met the prespecified interim futility analysis criteria.



In May 2020, we announced that we are providing free access to Mino-Lok for healthcare providers under an Expanded Access protocol to ease the burden associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the Expanded Access protocol, an infected central venous catheter can now be treated with Mino-Lok, potentially avoiding the need for the removal and replacement procedure.



In June 2020, we announced that we had received positive feedback from the FDA on our proposed catheter compatibility studies for Mino-Lok. The studies, if and when successfully completed, should allow Mino-Lok to be labeled for use with all commercially available CVCs and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) on the U.S. market. We further assume that these studies will meet European and world standards. The ability to be labeled without restrictions with respect to catheter type would allow Mino-Lok unrestricted access to the full U.S. and world markets for an effective antibiotic lock therapy for central line associated blood stream infections (“CLABSIs”).



In September 2020, we announced that another DMC meeting was held to review the data being generated and analyzed in the Mino-Lok Phase 3 trial based on progress to date, and to make recommendations to us as to any action that may be necessary regarding the study. After reviewing these data, the DMC members stated that they did not find any safety signals; and they also recommended continuing the trial without any modifications. The DMC further conducted an ad hoc meeting and agreed with the Company that a 75% interim analysis be conducted as planned in which superior efficacy is evaluated. The 75% interim analysis was subsequently changed to a 65% interim analysis by the Company.



In September 2020, the Company announced that the three registration batches for all components of Mino Lok were manufactured and that clinical sites were resupplied with registration product.



In November 2020, the Company announced that the three components of Mino-Lok, minocycline, disodium edetate (“EDTA”), and ethanol, were superior to EDTA and ethanol in their ability to eradicate resistant staphylococcal biofilms.



The 65% interim analysis was completed in June 2021. In July 2021, the Company announced that following an unblinded data review of safety and efficacy, the independent DMC for the trial recommended proceeding with the trial as planned. The DMC did not identify any safety concerns and no modifications were recommended to the protocol-defined sample size or power to achieve the primary endpoint.





7







As of December 21, 2022, the Mino-Lok Phase 3 trial has resulted in:




● | 169 patients enrolled to date vs. a planned 144 patients;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | 72 failure events to date vs. a planned 92 failure events; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | 17 patients currently in treatment or pending study completion data. These may result in future failure events.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Completion of enrollment is expected in 2023.



Fast Track Designation



In October 2017, the Company received official notice from the FDA that the investigational program for Mino-Lok was granted “Fast Track” status. Fast Track is a designation that expedites FDA review to facilitate development of drugs which treat a serious or life-threatening condition and fill an unmet medical need. A drug that receives Fast Track designation is eligible for the following:

● | More frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the drug’s development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | More frequent written correspondence from the FDA about the design of the clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Priority review to shorten the FDA review process for a new drug from ten months to six months; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rolling review, which means Citius can submit completed sections of its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for review by the FDA, rather than waiting until every section of the application is completed before the entire application can be submitted for review.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mino-Lok International Study



In October 2017, data from an international study on Mino-Lok was presented at the Infectious Disease Conference, (“ID Week”), in San Diego, California. The 44-patient study was conducted in Brazil, Lebanon and Japan and showed Mino-Lok therapy was an effective intervention to salvage long-term, infected CVCs in CRBSIs in patients who had cancer with limited vascular access. This study showed 95% effectiveness for Mino-Lok therapy in achieving microbiological eradication of the CVCs as compared to 83% for the control. The single failure in the Mino-Lok arm was due to a patient with Burkholderia cepacia that was resistant to all antibiotics tested.



Stability Patent Application for Mino-Lok



In October 2018, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued U.S. Patent No. 10,086,114, entitled “Antimicrobial Solutions with Enhanced Stability.” On October 9, 2019, the European Patent Office (“EPO”) granted European Patent No. 3370794, entitled “Antimicrobial Solutions with Enhanced Stability.” The grant of this European patent strengthens the intellectual property protection for Mino-Lok through November of 2036. This invention overcomes limitations in mixing antimicrobial solutions in which components have precipitated because of physical and/or chemical factors, thus limiting the stability of the post-mix solutions. The scientists and technologists at MDACC have been able to improve the stability of the post-mixed solutions through adjustments of the post-mixed pH of the solution. This may allow for longer storage time of the ready-to-use solution. Citius holds the exclusive worldwide license which provides access to this patented technology for development and commercialization of Mino-Lok.

Market Opportunity



In spite of best clinical practice, catheters contribute to approximately 70% of blood stream infections that occur in the intensive care unit or are associated with hemodialysis or cancer patients (approximately 470,000 per year). Bacteria enter the catheter either from the skin or intraluminally through the catheter hub. Once in the catheter, bacteria tend to form a protective biofilm on the interior surface of the catheter that is resistant to most antimicrobial solutions. The most frequently used maintenance flush, heparin, actually stimulates biofilm formation. Heparin is widely used as a prophylactic lock solution, in spite of the evidence that it contributes to the promotion of biofilm formation. The formation of bacterial biofilm usually precedes CRBSIs.



The standard of care in the management of CRBSI patients consists of removing the infected CVC and replacing it with a new catheter at a different vascular access site. However, in cancer and hemodialysis patients with long-term surgically implantable silicone catheters, removal of the CVC and reinsertion of a new one at a different site might be difficult, or even impossible, because of the unavailability of other accessible vascular sites and the need to maintain infusion therapy. Furthermore, critically ill patients with short-term catheters often have underlying coagulopathy, which makes reinsertion of a new CVC at a different site, in the setting of CRBSIs, risky in terms of mechanical complications, such as pneumothorax, misplacement, or arterial puncture. Studies have also revealed that CRBSI patients may be associated with serious complications, including septic thrombosis, endocarditis and disseminated infection, particularly if caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Candida species. Furthermore, catheter retention in patients with CRBSIs is associated with a higher risk of relapse and poor response to antimicrobial therapy.



According to Maki et al., published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings in 2006, there are approximately 250,000 CRBSIs annually in the U.S. Subsequent to this study, our estimates have ranged upwards to over 450,000 CLABSIs annually (see analysis in the table below). CRBSIs are associated with a 12% to 35% mortality rate and an attributable cost of $35,000 to $56,000 per episode.



We estimate that the potential market for Mino-Lok in the U.S. to be approximately $500 million to $1 billion as shown in the table below based on a target price of up to $300 per dose of each salvage flush treatment.




 | Short-Term CVC | Long-Term CVC | Total

Under various plausible pricing scenarios, we believe that Mino-Lok would be cost-saving to the healthcare system given that the removal of an infected CVC and replacement of a new catheter in a different venous access site is estimated by us to cost between $8,000 and $10,000. Furthermore, there are potential additional medical benefits, a reduction in patient discomfort and avoidance of serious adverse events with the Mino-Lok approach since the catheter remains in place and is not subject to manipulation. We believe there will be an economic argument to enhance the adoption of Mino-Lok by infection control committees at acute care institutions.



In January of 2017, we commissioned a primary market research study with MEDACore, a subsidiary of Leerink, a healthcare focused network with more than 35,000 healthcare professionals, including key opinion leaders, experienced practitioners and other healthcare professionals throughout North America, Europe, Asia and other locations around the world. This network includes approximately 55 clinical specialties, 21 basic sciences and 20 business specialties. As part of this market research project, we commissioned a third-party survey of 31 physicians to qualify the need for catheter salvage in patients with infected, indwelling central venous lines, especially when the catheter is a tunneled or an implanted port. There were 19 infectious disease experts and 12 intensivists surveyed who all agreed that salvage would be preferable to catheter exchange to avoid catheter misplacements, blood clots, or vessel punctures that can potentially occur during reinsertion. Most were also concerned that viable venous access may not be available in patients who were vitally dependent on a central line.

Halo-Lido



Overview



Halo-Lido is a topical formulation of halobetasol propionate, a corticosteroid, and lidocaine that is intended for the treatment of hemorrhoids. To our knowledge, there are currently no FDA-approved prescription drug products for the treatment of hemorrhoids. Some physicians are known to prescribe topical steroids for the treatment of hemorrhoids. In addition, there are various topical combination prescription products containing halobetasol propionate along with lidocaine or pramoxine, each a topical anesthetic, that are prescribed by physicians for the treatment of hemorrhoids. These products contain drugs that were in use prior to the start of the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (“DESI”) program and are commonly referred to as DESI drugs. However, none of these single-agent or combination prescription products have been clinically evaluated for safety and efficacy and approved by the FDA for the treatment of hemorrhoids. Further, many hemorrhoid patients use over the counter (“OTC”) products as their first line therapy. OTC products contain any one of several active ingredients including glycerin, phenylephrine, pramoxine, white petrolatum, shark liver oil and/or witch hazel, for symptomatic relief.
Development of Hemorrhoids Drugs



Hemorrhoids are a common gastrointestinal disorder, characterized by anal itching, pain, swelling, tenderness, bleeding and difficulty defecating. In the U.S., hemorrhoids affect nearly 5% of the population, with approximately 10 million persons annually admitting to having symptoms of hemorrhoidal disease. Of these persons, approximately one third visit a physician for evaluation and treatment of their hemorrhoids. The data also indicate that for both sexes a peak of prevalence occurs from age 45 to 65 years with a subsequent decrease after age 65 years. Caucasian populations are affected significantly more frequently than African Americans, and increased prevalence rates are associated with higher socioeconomic status in men but not women. Development of hemorrhoids before age 20 is unusual. In addition, between 50% and 90% of the general U.S., Canadian and European population will experience hemorrhoidal disease at least once in life. Although hemorrhoids and other anorectal diseases are not life-threatening, individual patients can suffer from agonizing symptoms which can limit social activities and have a negative impact on the quality of life.



Hemorrhoids are defined as internal or external according to their position relative to the dentate line. Classification is important for selecting the optimal treatment for an individual patient. Accordingly, physicians use the following grading system referred to as the Goligher’s classification of internal hemorrhoids:




Grade I | Hemorrhoids not prolapsed but bleeding. 
----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grade II | Hemorrhoids prolapse and reduce spontaneously with or without bleeding. 
Grade III | Prolapsed hemorrhoids that require reduction manually. 
Grade IV | Prolapsed and cannot be reduced including both internal and external hemorrhoids that are confluent from skin tag to inner anal canal.

Development Activities to Date



In the fall of 2015, we completed dosing patients in a double-blind dose ranging placebo-controlled Phase 2a study where six different formulations containing hydrocortisone and lidocaine in various strengths were tested against the vehicle control. The objectives of this study were to: (1) demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the formulations when applied twice daily for two weeks in subjects with Grade I or II hemorrhoids, and (2) assess the potential contribution of lidocaine hydrochloride and hydrocortisone acetate, alone or in combination for the treatment of symptoms of Goligher’s Classification Grade I or II hemorrhoids.





10







Symptom improvement was observed based on a global score of disease severity (“GSDS”) and based on some of the individual signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids, specifically itching and overall pain and discomfort. Within the first few days of treatment, the combination products (containing both hydrocortisone and lidocaine) were directionally favorable versus the placebo and their respective individual active treatment groups (e.g., hydrocortisone or lidocaine alone) in achieving ‘almost symptom free’ or ‘symptom free’ status according to the GSDS scale. These differences suggested the possibility of a benefit for the combination product formulation. As a result of this study, we determined that the performance of the active arms of the study relative to the vehicle could be improved by re-formulating our topical preparation. Therefore, we initiated work on vehicle formulation and evaluation of higher potency steroids.



Overall, results from adverse event reporting support the safety profile of all test articles evaluated in this study and demonstrate similar safety profiles as compared to the vehicle. The safety findings were unremarkable. There was a low occurrence of adverse events and a similar rate of treatment related adverse events across all treatment groups. The majority of adverse events were mild and only one was severe. None of the adverse events were an SAE and the majority of adverse events were recovered/resolved at the end of the study. There were only two subjects who were discontinued from the study due to adverse events.



As part of this Phase 2 trial, information was obtained relating to the use of the GSDS as an assessment tool for measuring the effectiveness of the test articles. Individual signs and symptoms were also assessed but can vary from patient to patient. Therefore, the goal of the GSDS was to provide an assessment tool that could be used for all patients regardless of which signs and symptoms they are experiencing. The GSDS proved to be a more effective tool for assessing the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of the drug when compared to the assessment of the individual signs and symptoms.



Citius developed this assessment tool as well as other patient reported outcome endpoints for use in the recently begun Phase 2b trial and in subsequent trials. In June and July 2016, we engaged the Dominion Group, a leading provider of healthcare and pharmaceutical marketing research services. The primary market research was conducted to understand the symptoms that are most bothersome to patients better in order to develop meaningful endpoints for the clinical trials. We also learned about the factors that drive patients to seek medical attention for hemorrhoids in an effort to understand the disease impact on quality of life. The results of this survey, along with the information from the Phase 2b trial, allowed us to develop our patient reported outcome evaluation tool, ePro. This tool can be used in clinical trials to evaluate the patients’ conditions and to assess the performance of the test articles.



In March 2018, we announced that we had selected a higher potency corticosteroid in our steroid/anesthetic topical formulation program for the treatment of hemorrhoids. The original topical preparation, which we referred to as Hydro-Lido or CITI-001, which was used in the Phase 2a study, was a combination of hydrocortisone acetate and lidocaine hydrochloride. The new formulation, CITI-002, which we refer to as Halo-Lido, combine lidocaine with the higher potency corticosteroid halobetasol propionate for symptomatic relief of the pain and discomfort of hemorrhoids.



We held a Type C meeting with the FDA in December 2017 to discuss the results of the Phase 2a study and to obtain the FDA’s view on development plans to support the potential formulation change for the planned Phase 2b study. We also requested the FDA’s feedback on our Phase 2b study design, including target patient population, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and efficacy endpoints. The pre-clinical and clinical development programs for CITI-002 are planned to be similar to those conducted for the development of CITI-001 to support the design for a planned Phase 3 clinical trial.



In April 2022, we initiated a.multi-center, randomized, dose-ranging, double-blind, parallel group comparison Phase 2b clinical trial. Five cohorts of adults with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic Goligher’s classification Grade II or Grade III hemorrhoids are planned to be dosed. Approximately 60 patients per cohort are expected to be enrolled, for a total of 300 patients.



The key objective of the study is to evaluate the ability of the formulations used in each cohort to provide relief for patients with acute flare ups. The study will evaluate reduction in hemorrhoidal symptoms (including: pain, burning, itching, and swelling) following treatment and is expected to provide the foundation for development of the Phase 3 study.





11







A Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) instrument, developed by Citius with FDA guidance, will be used by patients to record and report important safety and efficacy data in real time. The instrument has been adapted for use on an electronic platform and will be loaded on patients’ hand-held smart devices. The study will also be used to validate the ePRO. Data readout of the trial is expected in the second half of 2023.



Market Opportunity



The current market for OTC and topical prescription (“Rx”) products for the symptomatic treatment of hemorrhoids is highly fragmented and includes approximately 20 million units of OTC and over 4 million prescriptions. None of the Rx products have received FDA approval and are only available due to the DESI program, which started decades ago after enactment of the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments. These DESI products have no FDA reviewed evidence of efficacy or safety and may be subject to withdrawal if an approved product were to be introduced. Several topical combination prescription products for the treatment of hemorrhoids are available containing hydrocortisone in strengths ranging from 0.5% to 3.0%, combined with lidocaine in strengths ranging from 1.0% to 3.0%. The various topical formulations include creams, ointments, gels, lotions, enemas, pads, and suppositories. The most commonly prescribed topical combination gel is sold as a branded generic product and contains 2.5% hydrocortisone and 3.0% lidocaine.



We believe there are currently no FDA-approved prescription drug products for the treatment of hemorrhoids. Although there are numerous Rx and OTC products commonly used to treat hemorrhoids, none possess proven safety and efficacy data generated from rigorously conducted clinical trials. We believe that a novel topical formulation of halobetasol propionate and lidocaine designed to provide anti-inflammatory and anesthetic relief and which has an FDA-approved label specifically claiming the treatment of hemorrhoids will become an important treatment option for physicians who want to provide their patients with a therapy that has demonstrated safety and efficacy in treating this uncomfortable and often recurring disease. We believe that our Halo-Lido product represents an attractive, low-risk product opportunity with meaningful upside potential.



Market Exclusivity



We believe that we will be the first company to conduct rigorous clinical trials and receive FDA approval of a topical corticosteroid-lidocaine combination product for the treatment of hemorrhoids. If we receive FDA approval, we will qualify for three years of market exclusivity for our dosage strength and formulation. In addition, we will also be the only product on the market specifically proven to be safe and effective for the treatment of hemorrhoids. Generally, if a company conducts clinical trials and receives FDA approval of a product for which there are similar, but non FDA-approved, prescription products on the market, the manufacturers of the unapproved but marketed products are required to withdraw them from the market. However, the FDA has significant latitude in determining how to enforce its regulatory powers in these circumstances. We have not had any communication with the FDA regarding this matter and cannot predict what action, if any, the FDA will take with respect to the unapproved products.



We believe that should Halo-Lido demonstrate, proven safety and efficacy data and receive FDA approval, and if Halo-Lido obtains three years of market exclusivity based on our dosage strength and formulation, we are likely to have a meaningful advantage in our pursuit of achieving a significant position in the market for topical combination prescription products for the treatment of hemorrhoids.



Mino-Wrap



Overview



On January 2, 2019, we entered into a patent and technology license agreement with the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System on behalf of MDACC, whereby we in-licensed exclusive worldwide rights to the patented technology for any and all uses relating to breast implants, specifically the Mino-Wrap technology. This includes rights to U.S. Patent No. 9,849,217, which was issued on December 16, 2017. We intend to develop Mino-Wrap as a liquefying, gel-based wrap containing minocycline and rifampin for the reduction of infections associated with breast implants following breast reconstructive surgeries. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize Mino-Wrap under several regulatory scenarios and achieve milestones associated with these regulatory options leading to an approval from the FDA. Mino-Wrap will require pre-clinical development prior to any regulatory pathway. In July 2019, we announced that we intend to pursue the FDA’s Investigational New Drug (“IND”) regulatory pathway for the development of Mino-Wrap. On August 4, 2020, we announced that we had submitted a briefing package to the FDA for a pre-IND consultation on Mino-Wrap.





12







In December 2020, the Company announced the receipt of a written response and guidance from the FDA Division of Anti-Infective Products to the Company’s Pre-IND consultation request for its Mino-Wrap briefing package. The briefing package contained information regarding pre-clinical data and a clinical development plan, along with questions for the FDA regarding safety and efficacy data that would be required to advance Mino-Wrap into clinical trials. The FDA granted a Written Response Only meeting regarding guidance and direction on our Mino-Wrap development plan. The FDA indicated that bio absorption simulation studies may provide information to support the development of Mino-Wrap and made suggestions on what should be provided relative to non-clinical support. The FDA provided guidance on the design of the drug elution studies and agreed that a large animal pharmacology study would be appropriate. They also agreed that a 28-day toxicology study appears appropriate and that microbiology support through existing data is acceptable. We are pursuing these studies and anticipate filing an IND for Mino-Wrap in 2023.



Market Opportunity



Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women worldwide, representing 25% of all cancer diagnoses with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer. In the United States, the overall rate of mastectomies, combining single and double mastectomies, increased 36% from 2005 to 2013. Additionally, the incidence of post-mastectomy breast reconstruction, following breast cancer treatment, has been increasing on an annual basis.



In 2017, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons reported that over 105,000 women in the United States underwent a post-mastectomy breast reconstructive procedure. Approximately 30% of these breast reconstructions occur simultaneously with mastectomy, with most reconstructions occurring weeks later.



The current standard of care in post-mastectomy breast reconstruction is the use of a Tissue Expander (“TE”), which is a temporary implant that is placed below the pectoralis muscle within the mastectomy space. Once a sufficiently large soft tissue envelope has been created, the TE is then replaced by a permanent breast implant. Approximately 80% of the time, a TE is used in breast reconstructions.



The rate of infection following a mastectomy with a TE is 2.4 to 24% with an estimated mean of 12-14%. Once the implant becomes infected, the patient is usually hospitalized requiring approximate two weeks of IV and/or oral antimicrobials. In addition, the TE is removed, leading to a delay of lifesaving chemo-radiation therapy, and a more complex reconstruction in the future.



Currently, preventive measures are used to decrease the rate of TE infections, which include a systemic perioperative antimicrobial agent with the perioperative immersion of the implant or irrigation of the surgical pocket with an antimicrobial solution prior to insertion of the device. This is also administered with immediate postoperative oral antimicrobials.



Based on the in vitro preclinical laboratory work, Mino-Wrap appears to have the characteristics necessary for advancement in the protection of human implants from subsequent infection.



NoveCite



Overview



In October 2020, we, through our subsidiary, NoveCite, signed an exclusive agreement with Novellus Therapeutics Limited (“Novellus”) to license iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs). Under this worldwide exclusive license, we are focused on developing cellular therapies. Specifically, we are seeking to develop and commercialize the NoveCite mesenchymal stem cells (“NC-iMSCs”) to treat acute respiratory conditions with a near term focus on ARDS.





13







NC-iMSCs are the next generation mesenchymal stem cell therapy. We believe them to be differentiated and superior to donor-derived MSCs. Human donor-derived MSCs are sourced from human bone marrow, adipose tissue, placenta, umbilical tissue, etc. and have significant challenges (e.g., variable donor and tissue sources, limited supply, low potency, inefficient and expensive manufacturing). NC-iMSCs overcome these challenges because they:




● | Are more potent and secrete exponentially higher levels of immunomodulatory proteins;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Have practically unlimited supply for high doses and repeat doses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Are from a single donor and clonal so they are economically produced at scale with consistent quality and potency, as well as being footprint free (compared to viral reprogramming methods); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Have a significantly higher expansion capability.
--+--------------------------------------------------




Several cell therapy companies using donor-derived MSC therapies in treating ARDS have demonstrated that MSCs reduce inflammation, enhance clearance of pathogens and stimulate tissue repair in the lungs. Almost all these positive results are from early clinical trials or under the FDA’s emergency authorization program.



In December 2020, the Company announced interim data from a proof-of-concept (“POC”) large animal study of its proprietary NC-iMSC therapy. The available results of NC-iMSC therapy in the study show improvement in critical parameters, such as improved oxygenation, less systemic shock, and reduced lung injury, compared to the control group. The study was conducted in a widely accepted large animal model.



In the third quarter of 2021, the Company completed the characterization and expansion of its NC-iMSC accession cell bank (ACB) at Waisman Biomanufacturing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to create a cGMP master cell bank (MCB).



In July 2021, Novellus was acquired by Brooklyn ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. (“Brooklyn”). Pursuant to this transaction, the NoveCite license was assumed by Brooklyn with all of the original terms and conditions in the exclusive license agreement.



In October 2022, Brooklyn changed its name to Eterna Therapeutics Inc.



Market Opportunity



Globally, there are 3 million cases of ARDS every year, out of which approximately 200,000 cases are in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has added significantly to the number of ARDS cases. Once COVID-19 patients advance to ARDS, they are put on mechanical ventilators. Death rate among patients on ventilators can be as high as 50% depending on associated co-morbidities. There are no approved treatments for ARDS, and the current standard of care only attempts to provide symptomatic relief.
Sales and Marketing



We are primarily focused on identifying opportunities within the critical care and cancer care market segments. In our product acquisition criteria, we concentrate on markets that are highly influenced by key opinion leaders, commonly referred to as KOLs, and in which products are prescribed by a relatively small number of physicians, yet provide opportunities for growth and market share. This strategy allows for a manageable commercialization effort for our Company in terms of resources and capital. We also seek to provide cost-effective therapies that would be endorsed by payers, patients, and providers. We believe that we will be able to commercialize products within the scope of these criteria ourselves, and that we can create marketing synergies by having a common narrow audience for our marketing efforts (“several products in the bag for the same customer”).



For our product candidates that fall out of the narrow scope criteria, we have identified pharmaceutical companies with large sales forces, experienced sales and marketing management teams, direct-to-consumer capabilities, significantly larger resources than ours, and non-competing product portfolios that we believe would make excellent sales and marketing partners. We intend to license our mass audience, non-specialty product candidates to such companies for sales and marketing.





14







Intellectual Property



We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality, licensing and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates both in the U.S. and abroad. However, patent protection may not provide us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. To help protect our proprietary know-how that is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests.
I/ONTAK Intellectual Property



On September 3, 2021, we acquired the exclusive license of E7777 (denileukin diftitox), a late-stage oncology immunotherapy for the treatment of CTCL, a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. E7777, an engineered IL-2-diphtheria toxin fusion protein, is an improved formulation of oncology agent, ONTAK®, which was previously FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with persistent or recurrent CTCL, from Dr. Reddy’s. We refer to the agent as I/ONTAK. The exclusive license, which was amended as part of the transaction, is with Eisai and includes rights to develop and commercialize I/ONTAK in all markets except for Japan and certain parts of Asia. Additionally, we have an option on the right to develop and market the product in India.



Under the license agreement, Eisai is to receive a $6 million development milestone payment upon initial approval by the FDA of I/ONTAK for the CTCL indication (which increases to $7 million in the event we have exercised our option to add India to the licensed territory prior to FDA approval) and an aggregate of up to $22 million related to the achievement of net product sales thresholds. We also are required to reimburse Eisai for up to $2.65 million of its costs to complete the ongoing Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial for I/ONTAK for the CTCL indication and reimburse Eisai for all reasonable costs associated with the preparation of a BLA for I/ONTAK.



Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, Eisai is responsible for completing the current CTCL clinical trial, and chemistry, manufacturing and controls development activities through the production of the BLA, which we filed with the FDA in September 2022, while we are responsible for the costs of correcting any major deficiencies in the BLA as well as the costs of any necessary companion diagnostic or pediatric study. We are responsible for development costs associated with potential additional indications.



The term of the license agreement will continue until (i) if there has not been a commercial sale of a licensed product in the territory, until the 10-year anniversary of the original license effective date, March 30, 2016, or (ii) if there has been a first commercial sale of a licensed product in the territory within the 10-year anniversary of the original license effective date, the 10-year anniversary of the first commercial sale on a country-by-country basis. The term of the license may be extended for additional 10-year periods for all countries in the territory by notifying Eisai and paying an extension fee equal to $10 million. Either party may terminate the license agreement upon written notice if the other party is in material breach of the agreement, subject to cure within the designated time periods. Either party also may terminate the license agreement immediately upon written notice if the other party files for bankruptcy or takes related actions or is unable to pay its debts as they become due. Additionally, either party will have the right to terminate the agreement if the other party directly or indirectly challenges the patentability, enforceability or validity of any licensed patent.



We are responsible for preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications and patents included in the licensed patents that we intend to pursue within the territory.



Under the terms of the agreement with Dr. Reddy’s, we are obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $40 million related to CTCL approvals in the U.S. and other markets, up to $70 million in development milestones for additional indications, and up to $300 million for commercial sales milestones. We also must pay on a fiscal quarter basis tiered royalties equal to low double-digit percentages of net product sales. The royalties will end on the earlier of (i) the 15-year anniversary of the first commercial sale of the latest indication that received regulatory approval in the applicable country and (ii) the date on which a biosimilar product results in the reduction of net sales in the applicable product by 50% in two consecutive quarters, as compared to the four quarters prior to the first commercial sale of the biosimilar product. We will also pay to Dr. Reddy’s an amount equal to a low-thirties percentage of any sublicense upfront consideration or milestone payments (or the like) received by us and the greater of (i) a low-thirties percentage of any sublicensee sales-based royalties or (ii) a mid-single digit percentage of such licensee’s net sales.





15







Also under the agreement with Dr. Reddy’s, we are required to (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to make commercially available products in the CTCL indication, peripheral T-cell lymphoma indication and immuno-oncology indication, (ii) initiate two investigator initiated immuno-oncology trials, (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve each of the approval milestones, and (iv) complete each specified immuno-oncology investigator trial on or before the four-year anniversary of the effective date of the definitive agreement. Additionally, we are required to commercially launch a product in a territory within six months of receiving regulatory approval for such product in each such jurisdiction.




Patents
-------




As part of the definitive agreement with Dr. Reddy’s, the Company acquired method of use patents in which E7777 is administered in combination with the programmed cell death protein 1 (“PD-1”) pathway inhibitor drug class. PD-1 plays a vital role in inhibiting immune responses and promoting self-tolerance through modulating the activity of T-cells, activating apoptosis of antigen-specific T cells and inhibiting apoptosis of regulatory T cells.



The following patents were acquired:



US Provisional Application No. 63/070,645, which was filed on August 26, 2020, and subsequently published as US 2022/0062390 A1 on March 3, 2022, entitled Methods of Treating Cancer.



International Patent Application Number: PCT/IB2021/0576733, which was filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization on August 23, 2021, and subsequently published as WO 2022/043863 A1 on March 3, 2022, entitled, Combination for Use in Methods of Treating Cancer.



Mino-Lok Intellectual Property



In May 2014, our subsidiary LMB entered into a patent and technology license agreement with Novel Anti-Infective Therapeutics, Inc. (“NAT”), who licensed the intellectual property from MDACC, to develop and commercialize Mino-Lok on an exclusive, worldwide (except for South America), sub-licensable basis. LMB incurred a one-time license fee in May 2014. On March 20, 2017, LMB entered into an amendment to the license agreement that expanded the licensed territory to include South America, providing LMB with worldwide rights. We are obligated to pay annual maintenance fees that increase annually until reaching a designated amount, which we must pay until the first sale of product. We also must pay up to an aggregate of approximately $1.1 million in milestone payments, depending on the achievement of various regulatory and commercial milestones. Under the terms of the license agreement, we also must pay a royalty equal to mid-single digit percentages to low-double digit percentages of net sales, depending on the level of sales in that year, and subject to downward adjustment to lower- to mid-single digit percentages in the event there is no valid patent for the product in the country of sale at the time of sale. After the first sale of product, we will owe an annual minimum royalty payment that will increase annually until reaching a designated amount, which we must pay for the duration of the term. We will be responsible for all patent expenses for the term of the agreement although MDACC is responsible for filing, prosecution and maintenance of all patents.



Unless earlier terminated by NAT based on the failure to achieve certain development or commercial milestones, the license agreement remains in effect until the date that all patents licensed under the agreement have expired and all patent applications within the licensed patent rights have been cancelled, withdrawn or expressly abandoned. The license agreement will terminate in the event we breach any of our payment or reporting obligations or NAT breaches any of its obligations under the agreement. NAT will have the right to terminate the agreement if we bring or participate in an action to challenge NAT’s ownership of any of the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the license agreement upon 180 days’ notice. The license agreement may also be terminated upon our and NAT’s mutual consent.

Mino-Lok is covered in relation to the composition by issued U.S. patent No. 7,601,731, entitled “Antimicrobial Flush Solutions,” which was issued on October 13, 2009. Mino-Lok is further covered in relation to its method of use by issued U.S. Patent No. 9,078,441, which was issued on July 14, 2015. The patents provide intellectual property protection until June 7, 2024. There are corresponding patents granted in Europe and Canada (European Patent No. EP 1644024, and Canadian Patent No. 2528522).



Stability Patent Application for Mino-Lok



In October 2018, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued U.S. Patent No. 10,086,114 (the “114 patent”), entitled “Antimicrobial Solutions with Enhanced Stability.” On October 9, 2019, the European Patent Office (“EPO”) granted European Patent No. 3370794, which corresponds to the ‘114 patent. The grant of these patents strengthens the intellectual property protection for Mino-Lok through November 2036. While the original patents for Mino-Lok (discussed above) cover the basic composition, this invention overcomes limitations in mixing antimicrobial solutions in which components have precipitated because of physical and/or chemical factors, thus limiting the stability of the post-mix solutions. The scientists and technologists at MDACC have been able to improve the stability of the post-mixed solutions through adjustments of the post-mixed pH of the solution. This may allow for longer storage time of the ready-to-use solution. As such, the patents claiming the enhanced stability may effectively extend patent protection for Mino-Lok beyond the 2024 expiration of the original patents since it is expected that the compositions providing enhanced stability would be preferred over any non-stabilized versions that a competitor may introduce after June 7, 2024. Citius holds the exclusive worldwide license which provides access to this patented technology for development and commercialization of Mino-Lok.



Mino-Lok has received a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (“QIDP”) designation. The QIDP designation provides New Drug Applications an additional five years of market exclusivity, which together with the potential three years of exclusivity for the new strength and formulation of Mino-Lok, would result in a combined total of eight years of market exclusivity regardless of patent protection.



Halo-Lido Intellectual Property



We are developing Halo-Lido to have a unique combination of excipients as well as unique concentrations of the active ingredients. The goal is to have a product that is optimized for stability and activity. Once the formulation development is completed and data is obtained, we intend to apply for a patent on this new topical formulation.



We seek to achieve approval for Halo-Lido by utilizing the FDA’s 505(b)(2) pathway. This pathway allows an applicant to file an NDA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from prior studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference to such prior third-party studies. This pathway would provide three years of market exclusivity.



Mino-Wrap Intellectual Property



In January 2019, we entered into a patent and technology license agreement with MDACC to develop and commercialize Mino-Wrap on an exclusive worldwide basis, with no rights to sub-license. We paid a one-time upfront licensing fee upon execution of the agreement. Under the agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize Mino-Wrap under several regulatory scenarios and achieve milestones that are associated with these regulatory options leading to an approval from the FDA. We are obligated to pay annual maintenance fees that increase annually until reaching a designated amount, which we must pay until the first sale of product. We also must pay up to an aggregate of $2.1 million in milestone payments, depending on the achievement of various regulatory and commercial milestones. Under the terms of the license agreement, we also must pay a royalty equal to mid- to upper-single digit percentages of net sales, depending on the level of sales in that year, and subject to downward adjustment to lower- to mid-single digit percentages in the event there is no valid patent for the product in the United States at the time of sale. After the first sale of product, we will owe an annual minimum royalty payment that will increase annually for the duration of the term. We will be responsible for all patent expenses incurred by MDACC for the term of the agreement although MDACC is responsible for filing, prosecution and maintenance of all patents.

The term of the license agreement will end on the later of the expiration of all licensed patents, or the fifteenth anniversary of the agreement. MDACC may terminate the license agreement at any time after four years in any country if we have not commercialized or are not actively attempting to commercialize a product in such country. The license agreement will terminate in the event we breach any of our payment or reporting obligations or MDACC breaches any of its obligations under the agreement. MDACC will have the right to terminate the agreement if we bring or participate in an action to challenge MDACC’s ownership of any of the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the license agreement upon 180 days’ notice. The license agreement may also be terminated upon our and MDACC’s mutual consent.



In December 2017, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent No. 9,849,217, entitled “Antimicrobial Wraps for Medical Implants.” This invention overcomes limitations in breast reconstruction utilizing tissue expanders and implants following mastectomies by providing, in certain aspects, biodegradable antimicrobial film that may be wrapped around a medical implant such as a breast implant prior to the insertion into a subject such as a human patient. The scientists and technologists at MDACC have developed a biodegradable covering for a medical implant comprising a highly plasticized gelatin and at least one drug to reduce infection.



On November 18, 2021, MDACC filed a provisional patent application entitled “Antimicrobial Wraps for Medical Implants” in which the manufacturing process of the wrap now incorporates a freeze-drying process to prevent degradation of the active drug.



Citius holds the exclusive worldwide license, which provides access to this patented technology for development and commercialization of Mino-Wrap.



NoveCite Intellectual Property



In October 2020, we, through our subsidiary NoveCite, Inc., entered into a license agreement with Novellus Therapeutics Limited (“Licensor”), whereby NoveCite acquired an exclusive, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, to develop and commercialize a stem cell therapy based on the Licensor’s patented technology for the treatment of acute pneumonitis of any etiology in which inflammation is a major agent in humans. The patented technology consists of mesenchymal stem cells (“MSCs”) derived from an induced pluripotent stem cell line that is made by Licensor using the mRNA cell reprogramming methods in the patents covering the licensed technology.



Upon execution of the license agreement, NoveCite paid an upfront payment of $5,000,000 and issued to Licensor shares of NoveCite’s common stock representing 25% of NoveCite’s currently outstanding equity. We own the other 75% of NoveCite’s currently outstanding equity.



NoveCite is obligated to pay Licensor up to an aggregate of $51,000,000 in milestone payments upon the achievement of various regulatory and developmental milestones. NoveCite also must pay on a fiscal quarter basis a royalty equal to low double-digit percentages of net sales, commencing upon the first commercial sale of a licensed product. This royalty is subject to downward adjustment on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis to an upper-single digit percentage of net sales in any country in the event of the expiration of the last valid patent claim or if no valid patent claim exists in that country. The royalty will end on the earlier of (i) the date on which a biosimilar product is first marketed, sold, or distributed by Licensor or any third party in the applicable country or (ii) the 10-year anniversary of the date of expiration of the last-to-expire valid patent claim in that country. In the case of a country where no licensed patent ever exists, the royalty will end on the later of (i) the date of expiry of such licensed product’s regulatory exclusivity and (ii) the 10-year anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product in the applicable country. In addition, NoveCite will pay to Licensor an amount equal to a mid-twenties percentage of any sublicensee fees it receives.



During the term of the license agreement, NoveCite is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to make commercially available at least one product in at least two markets: the United States and either the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China or Japan. Additionally, NoveCite shall (i) on or before the five-year anniversary of the date of the license agreement, file an IND for a licensed product in the field of acute pneumonitis treatment and (ii) receive regulatory approval for a licensed product in the field of acute pneumonitis treatment in the United States or in a major market country on or before the ten-year anniversary of the date of the license agreement.





18







Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, NoveCite has been granted a right of first negotiation to exclusively license the rights to any new products developed or acquired by Licensor which cannot include MSC’s, that may be used within the field of acute pneumonitis treatment. After receiving notice from the Licensor of the new product opportunity, NoveCite has 30 days to notify Licensor of its desire to negotiate a license agreement for the new product. If such notice is given by NoveCite, the parties shall then have a period of 150 days from the date of Licensor’s notice to NoveCite to negotiate, exclusively and in good faith, the terms and conditions for the new product license agreement.



The term of the license agreement will continue on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for any and all licensed products unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms. Either party may terminate the license agreement upon written notice if the other party is in material default or breach of the agreement, subject to cure within the designated time periods. Either party also may terminate the license agreement if the other party files for bankruptcy or takes related actions or is unable to pay its debts as they become due, subject to cure within the designated time period. Additionally, Licensor will have the right to terminate the agreement if NoveCite directly or indirectly challenges the patentability, enforceability or validity of any licensed patent. NoveCite may terminate the license agreement at any time without cause upon 90 days prior written notice.



Licensor will be responsible for preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications and patents included in the licensed patents in the territory. Provided however, that if Licensor decides that it is not interested in maintaining a particular licensed patent or in preparing, filing, or prosecuting a licensed patent, it will promptly advise NoveCite in writing and NoveCite will have the right, but not the obligation, to assume such responsibilities in the territory at NoveCite’s sole cost and expense.



During the term of the license agreement, Licensor is prohibited from commercializing or exploiting (directly or indirectly) any product that includes mesenchymal stem cells for any purpose in acute pneumonitis treatment (subject to certain sponsored research exceptions), or exploiting (directly or indirectly) or enabling a third party to exploit, for any purpose in acute pneumonitis treatment or otherwise, the original licensed cell banks line or any GMP-grade cell banks of a cell line derived therefrom and that can be used as starting material for the manufacture of products derived from the licensed technology. During the term of the license agreement, each party is prohibited from soliciting any employee of the other party, subject to certain exceptions.



In July 2021, Novellus was acquired by Brooklyn. Pursuant to this transaction, the NoveCite license was assumed by Brooklyn with all of its original terms and conditions. In October 2021, Brooklyn changed its name to Eterna Therapeutics Inc.



Competition



We operate in a highly competitive and regulated industry which is subject to rapid and frequent changes. We face significant competition from organizations that are pursuing drugs that would compete with the drug candidates that we are developing and the same or similar products that target the same conditions we intend to treat. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to compete successfully against these organizations, which include many large, well-financed and experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies.



I/ONTAK Competition



The following products are approved for the systemic treatment of advanced CTCL.



Mogamulizumab, sold under the brand name Poteligeo, is a humanized, afucosylated monoclonal antibody targeting CC chemokine receptor 4. The FDA approved it for treatment of relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides and Sézary disease.



Brentuximab vedotin, sold under the brand name Adcetris, is an antibody-drug conjugate medication used to treat relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, a type of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It selectively targets tumor cells expressing the CD30 antigen, a defining marker of Hodgkin lymphoma and ALC.





19







Romidepsin sold under the brand name Istodax, is a histone deacetylase (“HDAC”) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of CTCL in adult patients who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.



Vorinostat sold under the brand name Zolinza, is a HDAC inhibitor indicated for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations in patients with CTCL who have progressive, persistent or recurrent disease on or following two systemic therapies.



There are limitations in these targeted therapies, which often are discontinued due to toxicity and adverse events as well as a limited duration of response due to resistance over time.



Mino-Lok Competition



Currently, the only alternative to Mino-Lok in the treatment of infected CVCs in CRBSI/CLABSI patients of which we are aware, is the standard of care of removing the culprit CVC and replacing a new CVC at a different vascular site. Citius is not aware of any INDs for a salvage antibiotic lock solution and does not expect any to be forthcoming due to the difficulty of meeting the necessary criteria to be effective and practical.



At this time, there are no pharmacologic agents approved in the U.S. for the prevention or treatment of CRBSIs or CLABSIs in central venous catheters. Citius is aware that there are several agents in development for prevention but none for salvage. The most prominent of these appear to be Defencath from CorMedix Inc. and B-Lock from Great Lakes Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“GLP”). Neither of these lock solutions have been shown to be effective in salvaging catheters in bacteremic patients as Mino-Lok is intended to do, and Citius does not expect that either would be pursued for this indication.



DefencathTM (CorMedix Inc.)



Defencath is a formulation of Taurolidine 1.35%, Citrate 3.5%, and Heparin 1000 units/mL. Neutrolin is an anti-microbial catheter lock solution being developed by CorMedix to prevent CRBSIs and to prevent clotting. In January 2015, the FDA granted Fast Track and QIDP designations for Defencath. In December 2015, CorMedix initiated its Phase 3 clinical trial in hemodialysis patients in the United States. On June 20, 2018, CorMedix announced that it had completed its review and source-verification of the data required for the interim analysis of the Phase 3 LOCK-IT-100 study for Neutrolin. The data was then locked and transferred to the independent biostatistician for un-blinding and analysis, who then provided the results to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) for its review.



On July 25, 2018, CorMedix announced that the DSMB had completed its review of the interim analysis of the data from the currently ongoing Phase 3 LOCK-IT-100 study for Neutrolin. Because the pre-specified level of statistical significance was reached and efficacy had been demonstrated, the DSMB recommended the study be terminated early. No safety concerns were reported by the DSMB based on the interim analysis.



CorMedix submitted its NDA for Defencath to the FDA, which accepted the NDA in August 2020. The FDA set a target review date of February 28, 2021. In March 2021, CorMedix reported that the FDA, in its Complete Response Letter (“CRL”), informed CorMedix that the FDA could not approve the NDA for DefenCath in its present form. The FDA noted concerns at the third-party manufacturing facility after a review of records requested by the FDA and provided by the contract manufacturer (“CMO”). Additionally, the FDA is requiring a manual extraction study to demonstrate that the labeled volume can be consistently withdrawn from the vials despite an existing in-process control to demonstrate fill volume within specifications. In April 2021, CorMedix and the CMO met with the FDA to discuss proposed resolutions for the deficiencies identified in the CRL and the Post-Application Action Letter (“PAAL”) received by the CMO from the FDA for the NDA for DefenCath. There was an agreed upon protocol for the manual extraction study identified in the CRL, which has been successfully completed. Addressing the FDA’s concerns regarding the qualification of the filling operation necessitated adjustments in the process and generation of additional data on operating parameters for the manufacture of DefenCath. CorMedix and the CMO determined that additional process qualification is needed with subsequent validation to address these issues. The FDA stated that the review timeline would be determined when the NDA resubmission is received and that it expected all corrections to facility deficiencies to be complete at the time of resubmission so that all corrective actions may be verified during an onsite evaluation of the manufacturing facility in the next review cycle, if the FDA determines it will do an onsite evaluation.





20







On February 28, 2022, CorMedix resubmitted the NDA for DefenCath to address the CRL issued by the FDA. In parallel, CorMedix’s third-party manufacturer submitted responses to the deficiencies identified at the manufacturing facility in the PAAL issued by the FDA concurrently with the CRL. On March 28, 2022, CorMedix announced that the resubmission of the NDA for DefenCath had been accepted for filing by the FDA. The FDA considers the resubmission as a complete, Class 2 response with a six-month review cycle. The CMO has notified us that an onsite inspection by the FDA was conducted that resulted in FORM FDA 483 observations that are being addressed. The CMO submitted responses to the inspectional observations along with a corrective action plan and requested a meeting with the FDA to discuss. CorMedix also has been notified by its supplier of heparin, an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for DefenCath, that an inspection by the FDA for an unrelated API has resulted in a Warning Letter due to deviations from good manufacturing practices for the unrelated API.



On August 8, 2022, CorMedix announced receipt of a second CRL from the FDA regarding our DefenCath NDA. The FDA stated that the DefenCath NDA cannot be approved until deficiencies conveyed to the CMO and the heparin API supplier are resolved to the satisfaction of the FDA. There were no other requirements identified by the FDA for CorMedix prior to resubmission of the NDA. As part of the NDA review process, the FDA also notified CorMedix that although the tradename DefenCath was conditionally approved, the FDA now has identified potential confusion with another pending product name that is also under review. The ultimate acceptability of the proposed tradename is dependent upon which application is approved first. As a precaution, CorMedix has submitted an alternative proprietary name to the FDA which will undergo review.



CorMedix also announced that it had finalized an agreement with Alcami Corporation, or Alcami, a U.S. based contract manufacturer with proven capabilities for manufacturing commercial sterile parenteral drug products. Alcami will function as a manufacturing site for DefenCath for the U.S. market, and CorMedix expects to be able to submit a supplement to its NDA application around the end of the first quarter of 2023 to request approval from FDA for DefenCath manufacturing.



Satisfactory resolution of these issues is required for FDA approval of the DefenCath NDA.



 B-Lock™ (Great Lakes Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)



B-Lock is a triple combination of trimethoprim, EDTA and ethanol from Great Lakes Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“GLP”). On July 24, 2012, GLP announced the initiation of a clinical study of B-Lock. We are unaware as to the progress or results of these studies. In addition, we are not aware of any IND being filed in the U.S. for B-Lock, nor are we aware of any clinical studies to support salvage of infected catheters in bacteremic patients.



There has been no further public information available on GLP. GLP’s web site and phone number are no longer active and the Company believes that they have ceased operations.



Halo-Lido Competition



The primary competition in the hemorrhoid market is non-prescription OTC products. If approved by the FDA, Halo-Lido would be the only prescription product for the treatment of hemorrhoids.



Mino-Wrap Competition



The primary competition for Mino-Wrap would be the existing standard of care treatment, which includes a systemic perioperative antimicrobial agent with the perioperative immersion of the implant or irrigation of the surgical pocket with an antimicrobial solution prior to insertion of the tissue expander device. This is also administered with immediate postoperative oral antimicrobials.





21







NoveCite Competition



There are multiple participants in the cell therapy field both in the United States and abroad. We believe that the following companies most directly compete with NoveCite in our licensed field of acute pneumonitis treatment.



Cynata Therapeutics Limited develops and commercializes a proprietary mesenchymal stem cell technology under the Cymerus brand for human therapeutic use in Australia. The company’s lead therapeutic product candidate is CYP-001, which has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of graft versus host disease. Cynata also develops products for the treatment of asthma, heart attack, diabetic wounds, coronary artery disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome, brain cancer, melanoma, sepsis, osteoarthritis, and critical limb ischemia, which are in a preclinical model.



Athersys, Inc. is a biotechnology company that focuses on the research and development activities in the field of regenerative medicine. Its clinical development programs are focused on treating neurological conditions, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory and immune disorders, and pulmonary and other conditions. The company’s lead platform product includes MultiStem cell therapy, an allogeneic stem cell product, which has an ongoing Phase 2/3 clinical trial for the treatment of ARDS and has an ongoing clinical trial in Japan for the treatment of RDS. The MultiStem therapy also is in a Phase 3 clinical study for the treatment of patients suffering from neurological damage from an ischemic stroke, as well as in a Phase 2 clinical study for the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction, and has completed a Phase 1 clinical study for the treatment of patients suffering from leukemia or various other blood-borne cancers. The company has license and collaboration agreements with Healios K.K. to develop and commercialize MultiStem cell therapy for ischemic stroke, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and ophthalmological indications, as well as for the treatment of liver, kidney, pancreas, and intestinal tissue diseases; and the University of Minnesota to develop MultiStem cell therapy platform.



Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. operates as a bio-therapeutics company in Israel. It focuses on the research, development, clinical trial, and manufacture of placental expanded (PLX) based cell therapeutic products and related technologies for the treatment of various ischemic, inflammatory, and hematologic conditions, as well as autoimmune disorders. A Phase 2 study of PLX cells as a treatment for severe COVID-19 cases complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome has been initiated in the U.S. as well as in Europe and Israel.



Mesoblast Limited is a biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes allogeneic cellular medicines. The company offers products in the areas of cardiovascular, spine orthopedic disorder, oncology, hematology, and immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases. Its proprietary regenerative medicine technology platform is based on specialized cells known as mesenchymal lineage adult stem cells. In April 2020, Mesoblast initiated a Phase 3 trial using mesenchymal stromal cells for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome. The trial was halted in December 2020 after the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) performed a third interim analysis on the trial’s first 180 patients, noting that the trial was not likely to meet the 30-day mortality reduction endpoint at the planned 300 patient enrolment. The trial was powered to achieve a primary endpoint of 43% reduction in mortality at 30 days for treatment with remestemcelL on top of maximal care. The DSMB recommended that the trial complete with the enrolled 222 patients, and that all be followed-up as planned. At follow-up through day 60, remestemcel-L showed a positive but non-significant trend in overall mortality reduction across the entire population of treated patients (n=217). In the pre-specified population of patients under age 65 (n=123), remestemcel-L reduced mortality through day 60 by 46%, but not in patients 65 or older (n=94). In an exploratory analysis through day 60, remestemcelL reduced mortality by 75% and increased days alive off mechanical ventilation in patients under age 65 when combined with dexamethasone, in comparison with controls on dexamethasone.



Supply and Manufacturing



We do not currently have and we do not intend to set up our own manufacturing facilities. We expect to use approved contract manufacturers for manufacturing our product candidates in all stages of development after we file for FDA approval. Each of our domestic and foreign contract manufacturing establishments, including any contract manufacturers we may decide to use, must be listed in the NDA or the BLA, as applicable, and must be registered with the FDA. Also, the FDA imposes substantial annual fees on manufacturers of branded products.



In general, our suppliers purchase raw materials and supplies on the open market. Substantially all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so that the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on us.





22







If we elect to conduct product development and manufacturing, we will be subject to regulation under various federal and state laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Controlled Substances Act and other present and potential future federal, state or local regulations.



We have contracted with proven suppliers and manufacturers for active pharmaceutical ingredient, development and packaging. We are confident that all materials meet or will meet specifications discussed at the chemistry, manufacturing and controls meeting with the FDA.



Regulation



United States Government Regulation



The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. All of our current product candidates are considered drugs. Consequently, we submitted a BLA to the FDA for I/ONTAK in September 2022 and, depending on the results of our preclinical and clinical trials, we intend to submit an NDA to the FDA for each of Mino-Lok, Halo-Lido, Mino-Wrap and a BLA to the FDA for NoveCite.



In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the agency’s implementing regulations. If we fail to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, including clinical testing, as well as at any time before and after the approval process, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our company and its operations.



Before any one of our drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States, it must be approved by the FDA. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:




● | preclinical laboratory and animal tests, and formulation studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing that must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each indication for which approval is sought;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the submission to the FDA of an NDA or a BLA and the FDA’s acceptance of the NDA or BLA for filing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is to be produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------

Foreign Regulation



We and any of our collaborative partners may be subject to widely varying foreign regulations, which may be different from those of the FDA, governing clinical trials, manufacture, product registration and approval and pharmaceutical sales. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, we or our collaboration partners must obtain a separate approval for a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries prior to the commencement of product marketing in such countries. In certain countries, regulatory authorities also establish pricing and reimbursement criteria. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In addition, under current United States law, there are restrictions on the export of products not approved by the FDA, depending on the country involved and the status of the product in that country.





23







Employees



As of September 30, 2022, we had 21 employees and various consultants providing support. Through our consulting and collaboration arrangements, and including our Scientific Advisory Board, we have access to more than 30 additional professionals, who possess significant expertise in business development, legal, accounting, regulatory affairs, clinical operations, and manufacturing. We also rely upon a network of consultants to support our clinical studies and manufacturing efforts.
