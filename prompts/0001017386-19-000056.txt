Cellular Network Extender – Technical analysis
 
Why Poor Signals Exist
 A variety of factors may cause dropped calls and dead zones, including congestion, radio signal interference, tower hand-off, and lack of coverage. Despite continued infrastructure investment by operators, and antenna technology improvements by base station providers and mobile phone makers, these problems will continue for the foreseeable future. This is because many of the contributing factors can't be controlled by the operators and manufacturers. In order to understand how innovative 5BARz™ products are in improving phone signals, it's first important to understand the causes of poor signal quality.
Congestion
 In 1999, sales of mobile phones surpassed combined sales of personal computers and automobiles. By 2010, mobile phones had replaced land-line phones in 30% of U.S. households. Smart phones, led by iPhones and Android phones, have become indispensable personal assistants. Laptop computer sales outnumber desktop computer sales, and most laptops are equipped with cellular data chipsets or USB modems. Apple's iPad has sparked the connected tablet market too. Vending machines, automobiles, mobile sensors, and many other devices include "machine to machine" cellular data modules. As a result, the number of cellular voice and data devices will soon exceed the number of people on Earth.
 
If sheer numbers weren't enough, new uses for mobile devices are causing even faster growth in bandwidth usage. Obvious uses include video entertainment, videoconferencing, downloaded and streaming music, MMS, email, and application downloads. Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and many other social networking applications put further load on operator networks. Also, surprising sources of traffic have emerged, such as deliberate " missed calls ". A missed call is when one subscriber calls another, but hangs up before the receiving party answers. Since operators don't charge for these uncompleted calls, subscribers are using missed calls as a free way to communicate. In India, orders for milk are made this way. In Syria, five missed calls in a row signals the recipient to "go online" to the Internet and chat. In Bangladesh, it's estimated that up to 70% of traffic at peak times is due to missed calls. This practice isn't limited to countries with low per-capita income, and yet it places a high load on operator networks.
 There are sources of congestion based on location and time, too. Transportation clusters like airports, major highway intersections, bridges, and toll road gates all bring many people together at peak times. Also, because of home land-line replacement, many residential neighborhoods have many mobile phones in simultaneous use in mornings and evenings. Lastly, local population growth and immigration can result in too many phones for existing infrastructure. Due to long planning times, investment requirements, local government permits, and construction time, it's difficult for infrastructure to keep up with the pace of change in many developing areas, especially in growth countries.
 Radio Signal Interference
 Interference comes from both obvious and subtle causes. Certain materials aren't transparent to radio signals, especially durable materials used in buildings, large structures, and even automobiles. As a result there are radio shadows in which a mobile phone can't sense the signal from a base station. In addition, radio signals from adjacent channels or reflected signals can interfere with each other due to wave cancellation effects. In some cases these forms of interference primarily attenuate the signal (make it weaker). However, interference can also add noise, so that the ratio of signal to noise becomes too low for the mobile phone and the base station to understand each other.
 Tower Hand-Off
 Mobile phone networks are called "cellular" networks because they are made up of overlapping areas of coverage that are provided by base stations in fixed locations. As a mobile subscriber travels by automobile or train, he will eventually reach the limit of a base station's coverage. At that point, his mobile phone will "hand off" to a base station for the next coverage area. If signal quality is poor due to interference, or if the new base station is congested with too many mobile phones, the subscriber's connection may be lost.
 12



Lack of Coverage
 Some rural or developing areas don't have enough people or population density for operators to justify the cost of installing base stations except at wide intervals. In these areas the signal strength from the base station or the mobile phone may be too low to create or maintain a connection. This results in "dead zones" or dropped calls.
Solutions to Poor Signal Quality
 Operators know that dead zones, dropped calls, and poor voice quality are big problems, and that re-dialing while driving can be unsafe. Operators also are concerned about subscribers' ability to make emergency calls. They understand that people rely on mobile phones for business and connecting with family. As mobile phones replace landlines, operators are especially aware that mobile signal quality is critical. Operators also see that wireless data is increasingly important for personal and business use.
 To help, operators work with phone and base station manufacturers to improve antenna performance. They invest in new base stations in growth areas. They invest in technologies that enable more connections per base station. Operators have even provided refunds for dropped calls. However, many factors causing poor signal quality can't be controlled by operators. Therefore, products have emerged to help, provided by operators or companies who sell to either operators or subscribers.
 Femtocells
 Operators can provide femtocells to subscribers with poor signal quality at home. Usually the subscriber pays for hardware, installation, or a monthly fee. Femtocells are carrier grade and are like small base stations that communicate with operators by using the home Internet connection as a "backhaul". In addition to backhaul the incoming call is routed thru the internet as well, which leads to the degradation of a call when trying to access the internet as well as engaging in a call. Lastly, femtocells only work with phones from one operator, so families with phones from multiple operators may have to request multiple femtocells.
Repeaters
 Repeaters are usually carrier-grade equipment and are programmed for a specific operator. They extend cellular networks into buildings and small offices. As with femtocells, installation is complex and if not done properly they can cause network problems. Unlike femtocells, repeaters do not use the local Internet connections, but rather receive and re-transmit the signals between base stations and mobile phones.
Boosters
 Boosters are usually sold online and through retail. They vary widely in amplification power, quality of amplification, and power balance. For example, these products amplify signals at 1, 3, 5, or even 10 watts all the time. Using power over 1 watt increases the probability that a booster will interfere with surrounding mobile devices. Also, it would be more energy efficient to adapt amplification power as needed, rather than to simply use the same wattage constantly. Many boosters don't support balanced power in both directions between base station and mobile phone. This may result in only solving the signal quality problem in one direction. Since communication is bi-directional, this doesn't actually solve the problem. Varying quality of amplification also introduces noise, which can interfere with surrounding devices.
A New Class of Solution
 5BARz has evaluated the causes of poor signal quality, the needs of both operators and subscribers, and the solutions in the market. Femtocells, repeaters, and boosters either don't solve all parts of the problem or aren't optimal due to cost or other drawbacks. Using expertise starting with a team of engineers who designed sophisticated base station amplifiers for operators, 5BARz has developed a new class of carrier-grade technology. That engineering team grew to a multi-national team of engineers working on project specific challenges integrated into the 5BARz™ products. The result is a highly engineered hybrid of repeaters and boosters, intended for use in automotive applications, home, and office. 5BARz has tested these products in the lab, in the real world, and with operators. These products advance the state of the art to provide the following advantages: 
 13



Low Power Use
 5BARz™ products only amplify when required. The automotive products use less than 1/2 watt, while the home product uses less than 1 watt. This not only saves energy, but also minimizes interference with other wireless devices and the network itself. In fact, new rules being proposed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission are expected to mandate low power standards such as 5BARz now provides.
Simple Setup
 5BARz™ products don't require a technician to run wires, carefully determine proper location, or optimize orientation. No use of home Internet connection is required, and there are no switches or settings. The unit has a simple plug and play installation requirement.
Balanced Amplification
 This feature plays a key role in ensuring that the product does not interfere with the macro network, and is a feature covered by the Company’s patented technology. Received and sent signals need automatic balance management in order for both directions of a communication channel to be improved. 5BARz™ products are not only smart about adapting amplification levels, but also about balancing amplification for incoming signals from the base station and return signals from the mobile phone. This attribute is critical in that it ensures that the operation of the unit automatically avoids interference with the Macro Network. This automated process is a part of the 5BARz™ patented technology.
Signal Stability
 5BARz has done extensive design, testing, and re-design to avoid a number of problems experienced by the antenna design of alternatives. For example, booster products can experience oscillations when people, animals, or vehicles move nearby. These oscillations can weaken the booster effect or cause interference with other wireless devices. Many booster products are similar to 5BARz™' products, putting antennas close together in the same product package, but don't optimize radio wave interactions between those antennas. This weakens the boosters' effectiveness and is one reason why other manufacturers compensate by using too much wattage, in turn wasting power and increasing the probability of interfering with other radio frequency devices and the network.
Integrated Antennae
 The Company has developed and patented technology which facilitates the integration of both the receive and transmit antenna into the single device, without creating a feedback loop. This represents a very significant technological advance permitting the unit to be a self- contained plug and play consumer electronic.
 Broadband / Narrow band support
 The Company’s products can provide amplification for bands from 5 to 60 Mhz.
 Smart signal processing
 The Company’s product is also capable of “interference & echo” cancellation, in addition to automatic noise suppression. As a result, the signal that reached your cell phone is both better quality and a stronger signal.
 
Self-regulating intelligent power management
 
The unit is designed to sense cellular signal strength and will automatically adjust amplification to optimum levels.
 
Remote Management of Cellular Network Extender
 
The Company has integrated into the cellular network extender, management and communications equipment and software to provide to the cellular operator the ability to monitor and control all of the cellular network extenders operating on their network. The cellular network operator is provided with a dashboard to monitor the functioning of the units, to turn down or off amplification, if necessary, and to remotely detect the functional performance of the unit to facilitate remote customer support.

Markets and Marketing strategy
 Cellular Network Extender Market
 
The Company’s primary entry point to markets for the Cellular Network Extender is through collaborative arrangements with Cellular Network operators. The following graphic paints a picture of the very significant strategic decision for 5BARz to concentrate our growth at the current time in India. Not only is the current subscriber base a leading factor in the global industry, but the growth rates for the next 5 years of 310 million new subscribers is the leading rate globally.
 
By 2017, it became abundantly clear that developing regions drive growth in the cellular industry. According to the GSM Association, ten countries will account for 72% of the growth in new mobile subscribers worldwide. The number of smartphone connections globally will increase by 2.6 billion by 2020, and again around 90% of that growth will come from developing regions. China is already the largest smartphone market, but India will be the real growth driver; it is set to add almost half a billion new connections over the next five years.

Market Penetration and technology mix
 
Equally important for the market penetration of the 5BARz Cellular network extender is the Technology Mix in our current primary market of India. Note that in the Asia Pacific region, in 2016, 26% of the market operates on 3G technology. The Cellular Network extenders developed initially for that market in India are 3G, single band 2100 cellular network extenders targeting a market of 182 million subscribers. The Company is now adding a 3G dual band 2100 and 900 for the market in India. The expansion of those products into the balance of Asia pacific region will increase that target a market by 275 million 3G users.

The Company has done some preliminary work in the past in Latin America. With the introduction of the 3G dual band
 Cellular network extender we will re-enter that market. You will note that the 3G market is relatively stable at 45% of the market of the 650 Million subscriber market, making that a target market for our 3G products of 292 million subscribers.
 

The introduction of the Company’s 4G LTE products in process will focus on the primary area of growth for the market in India, in the coming years, as well as facilitate the introduction of the Company’s products into the North American marketplace.

Marketing Developments in India
 
Following the introduction of a number of prototype units for use in India in December 2014, we commenced work locally through a variety of channels. The Company’s consulting engineering team put the cellular network extender units through a series of field trials in the region, and calibrated the units for optimal performance in the region. Equally important was the joint work that commenced with the R&D department of a Tier 1 cellular network operator in India. By the end of this process, we reached the conclusion that the Indian market had substantial need for our technology and products. The Company’s objective therefore was to manufacture and distribute the 5BARz products, working in conjunction with cellular network operators in India.
 
Since that early engagement in December 2014, our involvement in the Indian market has expanded further. Following successful field testing, two of the largest cellular network operators in India approved us as vendors. The commencement of the first shipment of units took place in August 2015 to a Tier One Cellular Network Operator. We have since received follow on purchase orders from that entity as well as purchase orders from a second tier 1 cellular network operator in the region.
 
During 2016, the Company completed a development project on its units which provided for remote management of each cellular network device deployed. That is to say, cellular network operators were provided with a dashboard through which they could monitor the operation of, and control units deployed. The units amplification can be turned up, down or off, so that the cellular network operator maintains control over the operations of their equipment on their network.
 
We anticipate that our commercial activities in India will grow and expand in various areas with additional cellular network providers adopting us as approved vendors.
 
In working with Tier one cellular network operators in India, the Company received the opportunity to develop and commence deployment of the Wi-Fi Broadband ROVR, which was completed in late 2016.
 
The distribution of the wireless market in India between cellular Network operators is as follows:

5BARz Data
 
Data Monetization is certainly the holy grail of the big-data discussion. Every now & then new sources of data emerge which transform the business landscape. The discovery of new rich data sources and analytics capabilities offer huge potential to the first mover creating Multi-billion-dollar companies.
 The last 30 years has seen exponential growth in data monetization, with a select few innovative companies looking well beyond just improving existing business processes with big-data; these organizations have aggressively looked to identify and exploit new data sources & monetization opportunities, creating huge value in a relatively short period of time. The Digital Media giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter have mastered this Data Monetization process. Their entire business model is built on monetizing data.
 
In the current scenario companies look for Data from a complex network of data sources to enrich decision making. The current eco-system has data-sources providing data on few verticals / dimensions. The ones offering a wider portfolio are the aggregators, where the authenticity of the data is low.
 
Management believe that the 5BARz business model, is the next big leap in Data Monetization, offering the Richest Source of Data available in the ecosystem.
 
5BARz DATA, provides insights from Different Dimensions, Diverse Sources, Real-Time data and most importantly Authentic data.

25




5BARz Data is much richer compared to ISP, Browser & APP Companies Data
 
What 5BARz collects is the data, at first at router level and then at an application level. From the router, we will know all the sites that the person visits, and the sub-pages as well. Further with universal cookies, we will know the data inside the browsing which is like what the person is searching for and what inputs a person is providing on the page. We also collect the relevant app data which no ISP can ever get. If they have to get that data, they need to put their own router and also put their own universal cookies and copy the exact model as we are doing.
 5BARz data is a confluence of the browsing and app companies like Google and Facebooks of the world, and the ISPs, and we have more as we have: 
 
· | device level data per home,
--+----------------------------


· | universal cookies that pervade all users’ browsing insights,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | multiple SSID which is identifiable to each family member, and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | the location correlation,
--+--------------------------


· | And further, IoT data is on top of this which no one has thought through or no schema exists as of now
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5BARz data is rich and different as it is a confluence of a wider array of data provided from the users household. This is completely unprecedented and new in the market.
 
5BARz Deep Learning Algorithms
 What we are doing at 5BARz is unprecedented and unique as we are accessing data at the router level that is structured and user validated. Access to this kind of data provides us the ability to create new sets of deep learning algorithms based on relationship correlation in the family unit. This creates a new dimension of household comprehension and hence improve data to the target marketer to better stage his marketing for family as a unit and furthers our socio psychological user profiling.
 Since our routers are static in a home, we also have access to geo location information, which creates a new algorithm to understand how a population in a zip, code, town, city, county, state and country behave. These create a new avenue for target marketers to fine tune their marketing methods based on location correlation, which will result in marketing becoming hyper-local. This is a new type of data set that other players have no access to.
 Apart from getting the age during the setup of our routers, 5BARz is pioneering on new ways of age detection. When age based Deep Learning with our new algorithms are employed, a new dimension of how a particular age group is trending will be learned. This learning creates another unique opportunity for the marketers to market based on socio psychological age correlation methods.
 Since routers are also functioning as IOT hubs, the IOT data gathered when run through our deep learning algorithms will create a predictive housekeeping.
 When the above 4 intelligence strategies are meshed with one another/ or each other, the Artificial Intelligence goes to a new level that no other technology has ever had access to.
 We are in unique position to get a 360 degree cross section of our user Internet activity. This is unique to us as we are sitting at the point of first contact of our user with the Internet.
 We can mine meaningful user insights from marrying unstructured Data from user Internet activity and 3rd party sources by using advanced machine learning techniques in our Deep Learning and other neural network techniques with our new set of algorithms for relationship correlation, location correlation, age correlation and IOT data creating an unprecedented intelligence for the digital marketer. The result is that we can provide better targeting for advertisers within the confines of user privacy policy.
 5BARz provides meaningful insights to its customer
 5BARz insights will be sold to various markets. We can group the markets into:
 ·               Product & Services companies
 ·               Market Research firms
 ·               Consulting Companies

BarzCoin
 
5BARz will implement and provide digital tokens called BarzCoins (in the form of a Crypto-Currency) to its device users. This is issued based on the data exchange that happens over the ROVR and is a mechanism to reward the user for the data exchange.
 BarzCoins can then be used by the individual to redeem in a crypto currency exchange or FIAT money or to buy goods/services on the 5BARz network.
 BarzCoin will be implemented as a crypto currency defined, mined and maintained on 5BARz blockchain, which will have all information on the data exchange, coins earned and used by the user from day 1.
 BarzCoin will be the primary method for paying the customer for the data exchange. The variability of the earnings from each ROVR user is captured by the denomination of BarzCoin paid to the user.
 For jurisdictions that has restrictions for settling the user with BarzCoin, 5BARz intends to implement a blockchain enabled reward Earning system with an Earning Ledger and an Earning wallet. The settlement of the Earning will be done in terms of FIAT money or goods and services. 
 Including such jurisdictions, globally, BarzCoin will continue to capture the intrinsic value of the business, namely the quantum and quality of data exchange and the value associated with such value exchange and shall be a utility crypto currency, with all BarzCoin based transaction residing in the allowed jurisdictions. 
 BarzCoin tokens will also be a security instrument used to raise funds for the 5BARz network build-out and represents a proportional ownership in the network and revenue generated from it.
 BarzCoin will be the tokenized representation of the network infrastructure, its data and all retained earnings generated by it. This will be one of the first security tokens that has hybrid functionality to leverage the many benefits provided by blockchain technology. 
 
Market Strategy – India as the first market
 
In the wake of the current economic situation which included the popular demonetization move by the Government of India, and the push towards a digital India increases the focus of internet connectivity in the country. A report by Deloitte, along with the industry body FICCI and the department of Telecommunications, show that there is a surge in the Broadband users in India.
 India is at a nascent stage in terms of adoption of Broadband, but the potential to scale followed by the push from the government, is substantial. India still lags many countries in terms of speed, percentage of people using broadband and the infrastructure. All that is set to change with the change in focus by the Telecom operators.
 There is an enormous push by the Government of India to make the economy a cashless one and increase the tax base by bringing a larger portion of the population into the system. This is possible by reducing the number of cash transactions and increasing the digital payments and online banking.
 
Broadband homes of India
 At US$61 per Mbps, India has one of the highest median costs of Broadband amongst all emerging countries. This is almost 4 times that of Brazil and Argentina almost 30% higher than that of a few South East Asian countries. The price of access being so high currently, results in the adoption of fixed line internet to be mostly in Tier 1 cities and amongst households that can be classified as Upper middle class or High net worth individuals.
