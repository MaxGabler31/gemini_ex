Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
GXO Logistics, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“GXO,” the “Company”, “our” or “we”), is the largest pure-play contract logistics provider in the world, and a foremost innovator in an industry propelled by strong secular tailwinds. We provide our customers with high-value-add warehousing and distribution, order fulfillment, e-commerce, reverse logistics and other supply chain services differentiated by our ability to deliver technology-enabled, customized solutions at scale. As of December 31, 2021, we operated in approximately 906 facilities worldwide, totaling 195 million square feet of space that we operate primarily on behalf of large corporations, that have outsourced their warehousing, distribution and other related activities to us.
Our revenue is diversified among hundreds of customers, including many multinational corporations, across numerous verticals. Our customers rely on us to move their goods with high efficiency through their supply chains — from the moment inbound goods arrive at our logistics sites, through fulfillment and distribution, and the management of returned products. Our customer base includes many blue-chip leaders in sectors that demonstrate high growth and/or durable demand, with significant growth potential through customer outsourcing of logistics services.
The Separation
On August 2, 2021, the Company completed its separation from XPO Logistics, Inc. (“XPO”) (the “Separation”) and began regular-way trading of the Company’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “GXO.” GXO was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in February 2021. The Separation was completed under a Separation and Distribution Agreement and various other agreements that govern aspects of the Company’s relationship with XPO, including, but not limited to a Transition Services Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement (“TMA”), an Employee Matters Agreement (“EMA”) and an Intellectual Property License Agreement. For additional information regarding the agreements executed in connection with the Separation see Note — 3 The Separation to our consolidated financial statements.
Drivers of Value Creation
We have identified five key drivers of value creation in our business:
1.Critical Scale in a Fast-Growing Industry with Strong Secular Tailwinds: We are the largest pure-play contract logistics provider in the world. Our significant scale makes us well-positioned to benefit from the logistics industry’s predominant tailwinds — the growth in consumer demand for e-commerce and omnichannel retail, the rapidly increasing customer demand for warehouse automation and other digital supply chain capabilities, and the secular shift in logistics toward outsourcing.
2.Robust Technological Differentiation: Increasingly, customers want technology-enabled, highly customized solutions that incorporate intelligent automation and data science. Order fulfillment times are compressing, and new channels are emerging as companies seek to improve the efficiency, speed and visibility of their supply chain activities, notably in the e-commerce and omnichannel retail channels. Our focus as an innovator is on helping our customers meet the expectations of their customers, with reliable outcomes, more visibility and greater efficiency. The most effective way to meet these expectations is through outsourced solutions that provide advanced automation, digital visibility and intelligent machines, such as robotics and autonomous goods-to-person systems — all capabilities we offer today.
3.Long-Term Customer Relationships in Attractive Verticals: Our customer portfolio includes long-term relationships with blue-chip market leaders and world-class brands, including Fortune 100 and Fortune Global 100 companies. Our customers operate in sectors with high-growth outsourcing opportunities, such as e-
commerce, omnichannel retail, consumer technology, food and beverage, industrial and manufacturing, and consumer packaged goods. We have extensive experience in these verticals and we understand the specific requirements for quality control, real-time visibility, special handling, security, complex stock-keeping, time-assured deliveries and agility during surges in demand. The average relationship tenure for our top 20 customers in 2021, based on revenue, was over 15 years.
4.Resilient Business Model with Multiple Drivers of Profitable Growth: The vast majority of our contracts with customers are multi-year agreements, with facility lease arrangements that generally align with contract length. Historically, our customer retention rate has been over 90%. Additionally, our business requires limited maintenance capital spending, which provides us with the flexibility to adjust our overall capital spending to changes in the macro environment. We are committed to the ongoing deployment of our technology in areas such as labor productivity, warehouse management, inventory management, demand forecasting and advanced automation to maximize stockholder value.
5.Experienced and Cohesive Leadership: Our executives have decades of experience in their respective fields and work together to create sustainable value through operational excellence and a purposeful culture. Our executives foster a company culture that is safe, respectful, entrepreneurial, innovative and inclusive, with a focus on diversity, inclusion and belonging that continues to shape our recruitment efforts and work environments.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to help our customers manage their supply chains for optimal efficiency, using our network of people, technology and other physical assets. We deliver value to customers in the form of technological innovations, process efficiencies, cost efficiencies and reliable outcomes. Our services are both highly responsive to customer goals, such as increasing visibility in the supply chain, decreasing fulfillment times and mitigating environmental impacts and being proactive in identifying potential improvements.
Our strategy addresses growth and optimization by focusing on consumer-related sectors that demonstrate enduring demand over time and where we already have a deep presence. We expect to attract new customers and expand the services we provide to existing customers through new projects, thus earning more of their external and internal logistics spend. We intend to integrate best practices to drive productivity, with a focus on automation and other levers of profitable growth.
To aid in executing our strategy, we have instilled a culture that focuses on delivering mutually beneficial results for our customers and our company with the highest legal and ethical standards and clear policies and practices to support compliance throughout our organization.
Technology and Intellectual Property
Our industry is evolving and customers want to reduce risk and increase the productivity of their supply chains. We are well-positioned to meet these expectations because we have prioritized visibility, quality control and automation in our technological development.
Our highly scalable platform is built on the cloud to speed the deployment of new ways to increase efficiency and leverage our footprint. In a relatively short time, we can implement innovations across multiple geographies or take an innovation developed for one vertical and apply it to other verticals to enhance the value we offer our customers.
To date, the most significant impacts of our proprietary technology are in three areas: labor and inventory management productivity, intelligent warehouse automation and predictive analytics, all of which are integrated through our proprietary warehouse management platform.
Labor and Inventory Management
Our productivity is driven by our comprehensive “Smart” suite of intelligent tools and analytics designed to optimize labor and inventory management. This technology incorporates dynamic data science, predictive analytics and machine learning to aid decision-making. Our site managers use these tools to improve productivity in site-specific ways in a safe, disciplined and cost-effective manner.
Intelligent Warehouse Automation
Our intelligent warehouse automation includes deployments of autonomous robots and cobots, automated sortation systems, automated guided vehicles, goods-to-person systems and wearable smart devices — these are all effective ways to deliver critical improvements in speed, accuracy and productivity. Importantly, automation also enhances safety and the overall quality of employment. Our warehouse management system creates a synchronized environment across automation platforms to control these technologies holistically, providing an integrated solution.
We have found that autonomous goods-to-person systems and that cobots, which assist workers with the inventory picking process, can improve labor productivity. Stationary robot arms can repeat demanding tasks with greater precision than is possible manually. Robots are particularly valuable in markets with labor shortages and where wage inflation can erode customer margins.
Other technologies that differentiate our logistics environments are our proprietary warehouse module for order management, which gives customers deep visibility into fulfillment flows, and our analytics dashboard, which gives customers valuable business intelligence to manage their supply chains. Our connection management software module facilitates integration with SAP, Oracle and other external systems, enabling our customers to get the maximum benefit from our technology.
Predictive Analytics
Our predictive analytics add significant value for customers, particularly in e-commerce and omnichannel retail, where seasonality drives high volumes through outbound and inbound logistics processes. For example, up to 30% of consumer goods bought online are returned and this creates increased volumes at certain times of the year. We have developed analytics that predict surges in demand using a combination of historical data and customer forecasting.
As an industry leader that invests substantially in technology, we have access to an immense amount of data, as well as the analytical processing capabilities to capitalize on that data by incorporating our learnings into customer solutions. We believe our ability to process and act upon data is a key competitive advantage and differentiator.
Customers and Markets
We provide our customers with high-value-add warehousing and distribution, order fulfillment, e-commerce, reverse logistics and other supply chain services. We provide services to customers globally, including Fortune 100 companies in the U.S., European multinational market leaders and other renowned global brands. The customers we serve are primarily in North America and Europe and operate in every major industry. The diversification of our customer base reduces concentration risk. In 2021, our top five customers combined accounted for approximately 17% of our revenue.
Our revenue is highly diversified due to our expertise across a range of key verticals, reflecting our customers’ principal industry sector. In 2021, 53% of our revenue was from e-commerce, omnichannel retail and consumer technology; 17% from food and beverage; 13% from industrial and manufacturing; 10% from consumer packaged goods; and 7% from other industries, with the vast majority of our revenue generated in the U.K., U.S., France, Netherlands, and Spain.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive global industry with a highly fragmented marketplace where thousands of companies compete domestically and internationally. We compete based on our ability to deliver quality service, reliability, scope and scale of operations, technological capabilities, expertise and pricing.
Our competitors include local, regional, national and international companies that offer services similar to those we provide. Our competitors include Clipper Logistics, DHL, DSV Panalpina, Kuehne + Nagel, Geodis and ID Logistics. Due to the competitive nature of our marketplace, we strive daily to strengthen and expand existing business relationships and forge new relationships.
Environmental and Other Government Regulations
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies in the U.S. at the local, state and federal levels and in other countries where we conduct business. These regulations impact us directly, and indirectly when they regulate third parties with which we arrange or contract services. In addition, we are subject to a variety of other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption statutes.
Moreover, we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate. Historically, we have successfully resolved potential environmental exposure without a material effect on our business or operations. We believe that our operations are in compliance with current laws and regulations and we do not know of any existing environmental condition that reasonably would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.
A number of our sites are ISO 14001-certified to high standards for environmental management, and we have implemented numerous programs to manage environmental risks and maintain compliance in our business. U.S. federal and state governments, as well as governments in certain foreign jurisdictions where we operate, have also proposed environmental legislation that could, among other things, limit carbon, exhaust and greenhouse gas emissions. If enacted, such legislation could result in reduced productivity and efficiency and increased operating expenses, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations.
Seasonality
Our revenue and profitability are typically lower in the first quarter of the calendar year relative to other quarters. This is due in part to seasonality, namely the post-holiday reduction in demand experienced by many of our customers, which leads to less use of the logistics services we provide. Our business benefits from strong positioning in the e-commerce sector, where demand is characterized by seasonal surges in activity, with the fourth quarter holiday peak typically being the most dramatic.
Human Capital
Our success relies in large part on our robust governance structure and Code of Business Ethics, our corporate citizenship and engaged employees who embrace our values. As a customer-centric company with a strong service culture, we constantly work to maintain and improve our position as an employer of choice. This requires an unwavering commitment to workplace inclusion and safety as well as competitive total compensation that meets the needs of our employees and their families.
Employee Profile
As of December 31, 2021, we operated with approximately 120,000 team members (comprised of approximately 75,000 full-time and part-time employees and 45,000 temporary workers engaged through third-party agencies) in 28 countries. Our workforce is located as follows: 42% were based in the U.K., 29% were based in North America, 26% were based in Europe (excluding the U.K.) and 3% were based in Latin America and Asia combined. The 
majority of our employees in Europe and the U.K. were covered by collective bargaining agreements, while none of our employees in North America were covered by collective bargaining agreements. As of December 2021, approximately 35% our global workforce was comprised of women. In the U.S., 66% of our workforce were ethnic minorities as of December 2021.
We have made significant investments in the safety, well-being and satisfaction of our employees in numerous areas, including: diversity, inclusion and belonging; health and safety; talent development and engagement; and expansive total rewards.
Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging
We take pride in having an inclusive workplace that encourages a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives and mandates fair treatment for all individuals — these attributes of our culture make us a stronger organization and a better partner to all GXO stakeholders. We welcome employees of every gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, life experience, veteran status and disability. In November 2021, we appointed a Vice President of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging and we have launched a Sustainability Steering Committee and Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee in Europe and the Americas whose strategies will include support and contributions for our environmental, social and governance commitments and ongoing annual community engagement events.
Health and Safety
Our employees’ safety is always our foremost priority, and we have numerous protocols in place to ensure a safe workplace environment. We aim to maintain an Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordable incident rate that is less than half the published rate for the General Warehousing and Storage sector, based on the “Industry Injury and Illness Data” of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
We deployed a comprehensive array of protective measures and technology to maintain a safe workplace environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have taken many risk-mitigating actions to protect our employees, including offering 100% paid pandemic sick leave for eligible employees, procuring personal protective equipment for employees in all of our workplaces, and providing expanded access to mental health counseling services for employees and their dependents.
Talent Development and Engagement
Our employees are critically important to our ability to provide best-in-class service. We ask our employees for feedback through engagement surveys, roundtables and town halls, and we use periodic engagement surveys to gauge our progress and assess satisfaction. In this way, our employees help drive the continuous improvement of our business. We seek to identify top talent in all aspects of the recruitment process, and we emphasize training and development.
We tailor our recruitment efforts by geography and job function using an array of channels to ensure a diverse candidate pool. Our talent development infrastructure provides resources to employees who aspire to grow throughout their career, such as tailored skills development, training and mentoring. In addition, we maintain a robust pipeline of future operations leaders by using structured sponsorships and additional learning techniques to develop internal candidates who demonstrate high potential in supervisory roles into site leader positions. Our programs also serve to retain top talent by defining personalized development paths and attract new talent by differentiating GXO as an employer of choice.
Expansive Total Rewards
We offer a competitive compensation package to help attract and retain outstanding talent. We offer competitive wages and a comprehensive suite of benefits to all employees to maintain our positioning as an employer of choice in the talent marketplace. A number of the benefits we offer were introduced in response to employee feedback — in 
the U.S., examples include our pregnancy care policy, family bonding policy, tuition reimbursement program for continuing education, and benefits such as diabetes management, supplemental insurance and short-term loans. In Europe, the benefits offered vary by country and are tailored to the needs of the local markets. Examples include comprehensive healthcare and risk insurance, employee assistance programs covering mental, physical and financial wellbeing, pension plans, profit sharing, and local and global bonuses structured to offer competitive pay in each country.
