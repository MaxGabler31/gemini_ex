ITEM 1: | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Our Company
 
Ideal Power Inc. was formed in Texas on May 17, 2007 and converted to a Delaware corporation on July 15, 2013. Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms "Ideal Power," "we," "us," "our" and the "Company" refer to Ideal Power Inc.
 
We design, market and sell electrical power conversion products using our proprietary technology called Power Packet Switching Architecture™, or PPSA™. PPSA™ is a power conversion technology that improves upon existing power conversion technologies in key product metrics, such as size and weight while providing built-in isolation and bi-directional and multi-port capabilities. PPSA™ utilizes standardized hardware with application specific embedded software. Our products are designed to be used in both on-grid and off-grid applications. Our advanced technology is important to our business and we make significant investments in research and development and protection of our intellectual property. Our PPSA™ and bi-directional switch technologies are protected by a patent portfolio of 66 US and 12 foreign issued patents as of December 31, 2017.
 
We sell our products primarily to systems integrators for inclusion in larger turn-key systems which enable end users to manage their electricity consumption by reducing demand charges or fossil fuel consumption, integrating renewable energy sources and forming their own microgrid. Our products are made by contract manufacturers to our specifications, enabling us to scale production to meet demand on a cost-effective basis without requiring significant expenditures on manufacturing facilities and equipment. As our products establish a foothold in key power conversion markets, we may begin to focus on licensing our proprietary PPSA™-based product designs to OEMs to reach more markets and customers. We may seek to build a portfolio of relationships that generate license fees and royalties from OEMs for sales of their products which integrate PPSA™.
 
To date, operations have been funded primarily through the sale of common stock and, prior to our initial public offering, the issuance of convertible debt. Total revenue generated from inception to date as of December 31, 2017 amounted to $13.2 million with approximately 20% of that revenue coming from government grants. We may pursue additional research and development grants, if and when available, for the purpose of developing new products and improving current products.
 
Industry Background
 
Utility power grids are built using alternating current, or AC, generation, transmission, and distribution resources. This method of power transmission and distribution has been proven over time to be reliable and safe. The outlets in a typical home or business are AC but many electrical devices, such as computers, televisions, and other appliances operate on direct current, or DC, power. Batteries and photovoltaic, or PV, solar panels produce DC power as well. In order to connect DC devices to an AC power grid, a power conversion device is necessary.
 
We believe that significant changes in the supply of and demand for electrical power are driving demand for new energy infrastructure products and supporting technologies. In a traditional utility model, electrical power is generated from central stations and transmitted over long distance high-voltage transmission lines to substations where the voltage is reduced for distribution to consumers. Utility power grids are built to manage the flow of power in one direction, from generation to use, where sophisticated tools have been developed to match the amount of power being generated with the amount being consumed. Utilities ramp power plants up or down to closely match generation with load.

The rapid growth in worldwide renewable energy generation, such as wind and solar power, has added a new level of complexity to the task of matching power generation with consumption. These intermittent resources cannot be dispatched at will or relied upon to meet the peak power demands of the grid. Renewable energy sources tend to ramp up and down quickly. For example, a single cloud over a PV farm can cause electrical output to change dramatically in a matter of seconds. These new challenges make it increasingly difficult for utilities to accurately forecast and meet peak power demands.
 
Increased peak demand for power also has exposed weaknesses in the existing power grid. In high-cost, high-demand states, such as California, public utilities have instituted peak demand charges as a way to ration power during periods of peak demand and to incentivize commercial and industrial customers to shift their power consumption to off-peak times. At the same time, both the Federal and certain state governments have created incentive programs to encourage the development and implementation of alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind power, which has the adverse consequence of making peak demand more difficult to forecast and satisfy. Strains on the electric grid have resulted in significant brown-outs and black-outs that have heightened awareness of the vulnerabilities of the existing system. As a result, power consumers are turning to new technologies to manage their energy consumption, lower costs and assure a reliable source of supply. We believe that distributed generation with advanced power conversion systems, such as our PPSA™ products, is becoming an increasingly important element of this new infrastructure.
 
In response to these changes in the market for electrical power, a number of technologies have been developed to enable users to more effectively manage their consumption and, one of these technologies, energy storage systems, has emerged as an increasingly attractive way to mitigate the instabilities and market inefficiencies caused by these emerging power grid realities. For example, a commercial business can shift energy usage from peak to non-peak times by installing a battery energy storage system, or BESS. The commercial business can use electricity generated during off-peak hours to charge the BESS and then use the stored power to satisfy all or part of its demand during peak hours. Similarly, a commercial business can install a solar power system to generate power for use either immediately upon generation or for storage in a BESS for later use.
 
Battery energy storage systems and many alternative energy sources provide power on a DC basis. However, the electric power grid and most electrical equipment operates on an AC basis. Consequently, power conversion systems are required to convert power from DC to AC or from AC or DC as necessary to make the various components of the system function together. In addition to converting power, power conversion systems enable customers to regulate current, voltage and frequency while optimizing system resources such as batteries, PV and the utility power grid to reduce energy costs. Systems incorporating advanced power converters may also manage distributed grid energy storage and be used to create stand-alone microgrids to bring power to a business or residence if the main electrical grid, if one is present, is unavailable.
 
Our Technology
 
PPSA™ uses indirect power flow in which power flows through input switches and is temporarily stored in our proprietary AC link inductor. Our proprietary fast switching algorithms enable the transfer of quantum packets of power between ports in our system. As the AC link becomes charged, it disconnects from its input switches, resonates without being connected to either the input or output switches, and then reconnects to its output switches when it reaches the correct voltage and frequency for the application. PPSA™ is a power conversion technology that differentiates itself from traditional power conversion technology in key product metrics, such as size and weight while providing built-in isolation and bi-directional and multi-port capabilities. At December 31, 2017, we had been granted 38 US patents and five foreign patents related to PPSA™.

Figure 1: Schematic of PPSA™ Process
 


Traditional power conversion systems use continuous power flow that relies on relatively heavy and expensive magnetic components and bulk capacitors. Many of these traditional systems have custom hardware for specific applications By contrast, our conversion technology eliminates the majority of the passive components of traditional power conversion systems, including the separate isolation transformer and most of the inductors and bulk capacitors.
 
We believe PPSA™ offers several key advantages over traditional technologies, such as:
 

• | Bi-directional: PPSA™ is inherently bi-directional enabling power flow in both directions. For example, one PPSA™-based power converter could be used to both charge and discharge batteries. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Built-in Isolation: PPSA™-based power converters have built-in isolation and thus do not require an isolation transformer which adds cost, size and weight and reduces the efficiency of battery energy storage systems. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Multi-Port Capabilities: PPSA™ architecture enables multiple AC and/or DC sources and uses to be connected together in one power converter, minimizing total system cost for tying together, for example, DC solar PV and DC batteries to the AC grid.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalability/Flexibility: PPSA™ is made from standard industry components, is battery agnostic and software driven, thus providing scalability that enables rapid development cycles for new products and new applications. This same functionality provides ultimate flexibility for customers globally as it is capable of power conversion in both 50Hz and 60Hz AC environments. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Size and Weight: PPSA™ reduces size and weight by eliminating passive components such as isolation transformers, inductors and bulk capacitors. Reduced sized and weight result in lower transportation and installation costs. Our fully isolated 30kW power conversion systems weighs less than 150 pounds. By contrast, similar transformer-based 30kW power conversion systems typically weigh over 600 pounds. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Products
 
We currently sell several power conversion systems, or PCS, utilizing our patented PPSA™ technology. These products are described as follows:
 

• | The 30kW Stabiliti™ series has two product offerings, two-port (AC-DC) and multi-port (AC-DC-DC) models, which are both UL1741 Supplement A, or UL1741 SA, certified. These products are intended to be used in the stand-alone energy storage and microgrid markets. They are bi-directional and operate in both grid-tied and grid-forming modes with near seamless transfer between operating modes. Grid-forming mode provides customers the ability to form and manage a microgrid. The products operate in both 50Hz and 60Hz environments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The 30kW SunDial™ and the 30kW SunDial Plus™, which are also UL1741 SA certified, are intended to be used for the commercial and industrial grid-tied solar and solar plus storage markets. The SunDial™ is a PV string inverter which is field upgradable through the addition of a drop-in second DC port to connect batteries to a solar PV array. The SunDial Plus™ includes the PV inverter and the second DC battery port in one package. These products both include a built-in 6 string PV combiner and DC disconnects and are grid-tied, AC export only.

Future Innovations
 
Bi-Directional Switches
 
Our existing products incorporate multiple insulated gate bipolar transistors (“IGBTs”), which are power switches used in the process to convert power from one current form to another. IGBTs switch power in only one direction (DC to AC or AC to DC) and require the use of a blocking diode to prevent power from flowing back through the system. To enable our existing products to perform bi-directional power conversion, for each IGBT and diode used in our products, we must include a second IGBT and diode. These additional components have slight voltage drops that affect the electrical efficiency of our products and generate heat that must be dissipated. We have patented and are developing a new, highly efficient power switch called a bi-directional bipolar transistor, or B-TRAN™, that we believe will allow us to substitute one B-TRAN™ for two pairs of IGBTs and diodes used in our current products and is also a potential replacement for conventional power switches in the broader power semiconductor market.
 
Based on third party device software simulations and initial prototype testing, we believe that the B-TRANs™ can significantly improve electrical efficiency in our power converters. The higher efficiency would substantially reduce the heat generated by the operation of our products. As a result, products incorporating B-TRANs™ will require less space for heat dissipation which would allow us to increase power density, or power per pound, and reduce material costs.
 
In 2016, one of our semiconductor fabricators successfully tested single-sided B-TRAN™ silicon dies and the results were consistent with third party simulations that predict significant performance and efficiency improvements over conventional power switches such as SCRs, IGBTs and MOSFETs. In the second half of 2017, we shifted our focus to de-risking the proof of concept phase of the B-TRAN™ development timeline, as this phase of development was taking longer than anticipated due to the complexity of manufacturing complicated, two-sided power semiconductor devices. To facilitate this, we engaged a second semiconductor fabricator, on a parallel path, to produce a less complex to manufacture B-TRAN™ on an accelerated schedule for proof of concept and initial testing. In the first quarter of 2018, we successfully completed proof of concept testing of double-sided B-TRAN™ prototypes, validating the ability to make B-TRAN™ semiconductor power switches using conventional silicon semiconductor fabrication equipment and processes. Test results on the standard double-sided prototypes measured B-TRAN™ electrical losses at less than 40% that of conventional power switches such as silicon IGBTs. The results of this testing will be incorporated into the B-TRAN™ design and their manufacturing process. With the double-sided transistor behavior and low conduction losses confirmed, the next step is to incorporate planned corrections and improvements in the manufacturing process followed by the fabrication of prototype engineering samples for potential customers and partners.
 
We plan to first utilize the B-TRAN™ in our own power conversion products and then introduce it into the multi-billion dollar power semiconductor market utilizing a licensing model. We believe our new B-TRAN™ technology can potentially address a significant portion of the power semiconductor market that currently relies on power semiconductor devices such as IGBTs. Potential addressable markets for B-TRAN™-based products include solar photovoltaic inverters, microgrid power conversion systems, electric vehicle drivetrains, bi-directional energy storage, solid-state DC and AC contactors and breakers, variable frequency drives and other power conversion and control applications that could benefit from B-TRAN™’s enhanced switching performance. At December 31, 2017, we have 28 US and seven foreign issued patents covering the operation, control and manufacturing of the B-TRAN™ device.

Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to promote and expand the uses of PPSA™ initially through product development and product sales. To bring our products to market, we will seek out best-in-class partners who will distribute, white-label or integrate our innovative products into higher value systems resulting in multiple strategic sales channels for our PPSA™-based products and product designs. Although our primary market is the United States, we will increasingly target markets outside the United States as early as 2018. As our products gain broader acceptance in the power conversion market, we intend to license our proprietary PPSA™-based product designs to OEMs within our target markets, as well as license our technologies for other markets which we do not plan to enter directly. The basis for this approach is the belief that OEMs may achieve higher product margins and gain more market share by providing PPSA™-based products, which are differentiated from the traditional product offerings in the industry, to their customers. We believe such strategic relationships with key OEM licensees would enable us to reap the benefits of PPSA™ and gain market share more quickly than by strictly manufacturing and distributing our products.
Target Markets
 
Currently, our primary markets are solar + storage and, to a lesser extent, microgrids. We also intend to be opportunistic with regard to the stand-alone energy storage market. Prior to 2017, our primary market was the stand-alone energy storage market but we shifted our strategic focus in early 2017 to solar + storage as that market leverages the mature and global solar market while the nascent stand-alone energy storage market has been slow to develop.
Solar + Storage and Microgrid Markets
 
Solar PV has one of the lowest levelized costs of energy for new electrical generation capacity and we expect this to remain true in the near term. We expect distributed PV to continue to be a high growth business as system costs have fallen dramatically over the past several years. Accordingly, we expect the economics of generating PV for local consumption to remain strong for several more years, especially given the investment tax credit, or ITC, extension passed by Congress and signed into law in 2015 for solar energy production. Our SunDial™ products were launched to directly address this market. One shortcoming of distributed, behind-the-meter PV systems is that they require connection to the utility power grid in order to operate. For example, a business with PV on its roof will not, in most cases, benefit from the ability to generate power should the utility power grid go down. Another shortcoming of distributed PV systems is the instability they cause on the local power lines. Utility power grids were not designed to manage power inflow from the end of the lines. Asa result, distributed generation sources can lead to wide swings in line voltages when clouds pass and power output falls off, requiring the utility to ramp up its power generation to make up for the shortfall in solar. We believe the proliferation of PV, its intermittency and the elimination of net metering in many states may drive growth in the solar + storage market.
 
Whether for emergency backup power or for baseload generation in remote locations with weak or no electric grids, microgrids are an emerging business case for solar paired with energy storage. A distributed PV system connected to a BESS that includes one of our Stabiliti™ multi-port PCS enable a business to benefit from the ability to form and manage a local microgrid powered by the PV system and BESS even when the utility power grid is down. This capability is attractive to electricity consumers who need to power critical loads even in a blackout. Our Stabiliti™ PCS are also equipped to meet evolving utility requirements for low voltage ride-through and other key operating parameters, which may enable the PV and BESS it connects to the grid to help stabilize the utility power grid when voltage or frequency fluctuates due to imbalances in load and supply. In remote locations where there is no reliable electric grid or a dependence on diesel generators, which may be as diverse as a military battlefield or remote tropical island resort, or in locations where local electric rates are high due to aging and inefficient generation technology, a trend towards self-generation microgrids is developing. These sites can use solar, batteries and other forms of generation all brought together by one or more of our Stabiliti™ PCS to form and manage a microgrid using maximum solar generation for lowest cost. As such, we believe our products may become increasingly attractive to co-locate BESS with distributed PV.

According to their research, IHS believes that systems will be deployed in two principal configurations. One configuration is to have separate BESS and PV systems tied together through the AC wiring, which is supported by our current and legacy products. A second, emerging configuration is to place the BESS and the PV system behind a single PCS with two DC inputs. Our Stabiliti™ and SunDial™ Plus were designed specifically to enable this configuration which we believe is the lower cost and more efficient configuration. By tying the solar and batteries together as a DC-coupled system, the batteries become eligible for the Federal Investment Tax Credit, or ITC, and accelerated depreciation further enhancing the project economics. A key unique feature of the SunDial™’s patented technology is its ability to be deployed first as a standard commercial PV inverter and later be upgraded in the field to bring energy storage into the PV system using the same inverter. We believe this is the only product in the market today to have this unique field-upgrade capability for pairing solar with energy storage in one inverter.
 
Stand-Alone Energy Storage Market
 
The stand-alone energy storage market is served by BESS. BESS are racks of batteries coupled with a system controller and a power conversion system, such as those manufactured by us, to enable electric power to be captured, stored, and used in conjunction with electric power grids. These systems can be large, megawatt-scale systems operated by utilities to better manage their system resources, or smaller kilowatt-scale systems used by businesses and designed to enable these businesses to manage their power use and mitigate utility imposed "peak demand charges", which are charges utilities levy on their business customers for delivery of power at peak usage times of the day, such as mid-afternoons in the summer. The growth of peak demand charges has been substantial over the past decade and now can make up 50% or more of a commercial utility bill in certain markets. This is a trend that is likely to continue as more intermittent resources are added to the utility power grid causing grid instability. Utilities and aggregators of distributed generation resources are also expected to adopt BESS due to the proliferation of renewables and to take advantage of additional value streams such as energy arbitrage, frequency regulation and ancillary services, infrastructure upgrade deferral and locational capacity.
 
There are strong economic incentives available to commercial and industrial consumers in major US markets such as California and New York in the form of reduced time-of-use and/or demand charges for installing a BESS and managing when power is drawn from the grid or reducing peak consumption. There is also strong regulatory support for such systems. For example, California has issued a mandate for over 1,800 megawatts of new energy storage to be installed by 2020. Other states, including New York and Massachusetts, have also recently issued mandates for energy storage and we expect this trend to continue.
 
We expect the cost of commercial and industrial BESS to continue to decline due primarily to lower battery costs and, as a result, expect significant expansion in the addressable market for these systems. We also believe the combination of lower BESS costs, third-party financing, increases in utility demand charges, and the entrance of large, established companies to the BESS space may contribute to accelerating market growth for stand-alone energy storage.
 
Other Markets
 
Although our technology may be suitable for other vertical markets within the global power conversion market landscape, we do not currently offer products for sale directly to other power conversion markets such as the variable-frequency drive (“VFD”), uninterruptible power supply, rail, wind or electric vehicle (“EV”) traction drive markets.
 
In addition to the markets discussed above, we may also have opportunities for market expansion into fast electric vehicle chargers in certain applications where our products’ compact size and multi-port capabilities can unlock value for the system integrator particularly in locations where battery storage is coupled with the charging system to eliminate demand charges or expand the charging systems response capabilities.
 
We plan to continue to monitor all power conversion markets for opportunities to create solutions for customers and unlock the broader value of our patented technology.

Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patents, laws that protect intellectual property, confidentiality procedures, and contractual restrictions with our employees and others, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, the software that is shipped with our products is encrypted. As of December 31, 2017, we have 66 US and 12 foreign issued patents. We also had approximately 60 additional pending U.S. and international patent applications. We expect to continue to build our patent estate for both our core power conversion technology, our bi-directional switch technology and other technological developments that broaden the scope of our technology platform.
Customers
 
While we have historically been reliant on a small number of customers, our customer based expanded in 2017 and only one customer represented greater than 10% of our net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Sharp Corporation accounted for 15% of net revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Sonnen Inc. and Gexpro accounted for 44% of net revenues.
Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our products primarily to systems integrators for installation as part of a larger turn-key system providing end users with a complete solution for managing their energy consumption. Before a system integrator agrees to specify our products in their systems, the integrator engages in a lengthy and time-consuming process of testing and evaluating our equipment for use, which typically takes from a few months to as long as a year. Our products have also historically been sold through distribution channel partners and, although we do not currently have any active distribution partners, we may utilize distribution partners in the future.
 
For certain geographic markets and applications, we may seek to enter into licensing agreements that would enable licensees to build our products for sale in local markets or we may license product designs to global brands for specific applications. In 2016, we entered into our first licensing agreement for our SunDial™ with Flex Ltd. (Nasdaq: Flex). NEXTracker Inc., a Flex company, will sell the SunDial™ as part of its NX Flow solar plus storage tracker.
 
Manufacturing and Supply
 
We use contract manufacturers to manufacture our products to our specifications. We have an agreement with our contract manufacturer pursuant to which they manufacture our products pursuant to issued purchase orders. This agreement provides us with a moderate degree of rescheduling and cancellation flexibility. The agreement, executed in 2017, has a three-year term and renews annually thereafter unless terminated. We believe there are many contract manufacturers that are qualified to manufacture our products to our specifications.
 
Our contract manufacturer is responsible for the sourcing of components and materials. We qualify sources for our components and materials. Our strategy is to have multiple suppliers for all of our components and materials. Currently, we have multiple sources for most of our components. A very limited number of components are single-sourced and the process of identifying and qualifying alternative sources for these components is underway.
 
Backlog
 
Our backlog was approximately $0.2 million at December 31, 2017. The Company defines backlog as consisting of accepted orders from customers for which a product delivery schedule has been specified. The purchased orders comprising backlog are not cancelable in most cases and such orders do not typically provide price protection. Nevertheless, deliveries against received purchase orders may be rescheduled within negotiated parameters and our backlog may therefore not be indicative of the level of future sales. As our initial target markets are new or, in the case of the stand-alone energy storage market, did not grow as expected over the last two years, we have seen a trend where customers are not placing orders covering extended time periods such as six months or a year but are instead placing orders by project or by quarter. This trend results in lower backlog for us until such time that the market starts to mature and market growth is more stable and/or predictable.
 
10


Competition
 
We will compete against well-established incumbent power conversion technology providers, including PV inverter companies that already operate at a large scale in the PV market, as these competitors enter our target markets and, specifically, the commercial and industrial segment of these target markets. We expect that these power conversion technology providers will base their products on current technologies, described below, although we continue to monitor the competitive landscape for offerings or potential offerings based on new technologies. To date, we are not aware of any offerings or potential offerings based on new methods of power conversion other than our PPSA™ products.
Traditional Power Conversion:  Traditional power conversion systems are the conservative choice, as they are proven and have been commercially available longer than any other type of power conversion system. They provide isolation, but are big, heavy, and relatively inefficient. There have been improvements in the efficiency of transformer-based power conversion systems over the years, but we believe further improvements are limited due to the physical characteristics of transformers themselves. Major suppliers in this market include ABB, Eaton and Schneider Electric.
Transformerless PV Inverters: Transformerless PV solar inverters are a special class of power conversion system applicable only to PV arrays. They have become a popular choice in the market for PV applications, as they are lighter and more efficient than transformer based inverters. These transformerless inverters are one-way (DC to AC) inverters, and provide no electrical isolation. PV systems are not required to be electrically isolated in most electrical code jurisdictions. These PV inverters are not directly applicable to markets that require electrical isolation. Key providers of transformerless PV inverters include companies such as SMA Solar Technology AG, or SMA, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., or Huawei, and SolarEdge Technologies Inc.
Research and Development Costs
 
Research and development costs are presented as a line item under operating expenses and are expensed as incurred. Total research and development costs incurred during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 amounted to $4.2 million and $5.2 million, respectively.
Employees
 
As of February 28, 2018, we have 19 employees, all of whom are full-time employees. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
 
11


Industry Certifications
 
Industry certifications are generally required for our products. The main certification requirement is conformance to UL1741 Supplement A, or UL1741 SA, which specifies standards for grid and product safety for grid-connected generation equipment, including the power conversion systems made by us. A National Recognized Testing Laboratory, or NRTL, must certify our products for conformance to UL1741 SA before our customers may install and use our products in grid-tied applications in the United States. We utilize Underwriters Laboratories, or UL, for our certification requirements.
 
The European Union, or EU, Japan and certain other major jurisdictions have different certification test procedures, but generally test for similar safety and performance capabilities. Local certifications are likely to be required to sell our products outside of the United States for many applications. To date, we have not received any international certifications on our products but have deployed products in a few instances in foreign countries as demonstrations, test projects in laboratories or microgrid applications which may be exempt from the certification requirements. We currently do not have plans to start the certification process in any international market in 2018.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government approval is not required for us to sell our products. However, government support for renewable energy, grid storage, electric vehicle charging infrastructure and improved grid resiliency, including incentives and mandates, may impact the size and growth rate of our target markets. Utility regulations and support may also impact these end markets. In the near term, government and utility support for many of these markets is generally required for these markets to grow and therefore changes in policy by governments or utilities may limit the near-term market opportunities for our products.
