Item 1. | Business

Corporate History
We were originally organized in 1995 as a holding company for the operations of Nextel Communications, Inc., or Nextel Communications, in selected international markets. The corporation that is currently known as NII Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2000 as Nextel International, Inc. In December 2001, we changed our name from Nextel International, Inc. to NII Holdings, Inc. Our principal executive office is located at 12110 Sunset Hills Road, Suite 600, Reston, Virginia 20190. Our telephone number at that location is (703) 390-5100. Unless the context requires otherwise, “NII Holdings, Inc.,” “NII Holdings,” “NII,” “we,” “our,” “us” and “the Company” refer to the combined businesses of NII Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We conduct substantially all of our business through our Brazilian operating company, Nextel Telecomunicações Ltda., which we refer to as Nextel Brazil. Nextel Brazil's operations are headquartered in São Paulo, with branch offices in Rio de Janeiro and various other cities in Brazil. 
Except as otherwise indicated, all amounts are expressed in United States, or U.S., dollars and references to “dollars” and “$” are to U.S. dollars. All historical financial statements contained in this report are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP.
Proposed Sale of Nextel Brazil
On March 18, 2019, NII Holdings, Inc. and NII International Holdings S.à r.l., or NIIH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NII, entered into a purchase agreement with América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V., or AMX, and AI Brazil Holdings B.V., or AI Brazil Holdings, pursuant to which NII and AI Brazil Holdings will sell their jointly-owned wireless operations in Brazil. Specifically, NIIH will sell all of the issued and outstanding shares of NII Brazil Holdings S.à r.l., or NIIBH, and such shares, together with any shares of NIIBH issued after the date of the purchase agreement, or the acquired equity interests, to AMX. We refer to this transaction as the Nextel Brazil transaction. Also pursuant to the purchase agreement, concurrent to, and as a condition of, the consummation of the Nextel Brazil transaction, AI Brazil Holdings will sell all of its interests in Nextel Holdings S.à r.l., or Nextel Holdings, to NIIBH. We refer to this transaction as the AI Brazil Holdings transaction. At the closing of the Nextel Brazil transaction and the AI Brazil Holdings transaction, AMX will indirectly own all of the issued and outstanding shares of Nextel Brazil.
Under the terms of the purchase agreement, AMX will acquire the acquired equity interests for an aggregate purchase price of $905.0 million on a debt free and cash free basis, subject to certain adjustments at closing, including reimbursement for capital expenditures and working capital investments made from March 1, 2019 to closing. AI Brazil Holdings will receive its pro rata share of the net purchase price plus the preferred return contemplated in the Amended and Restated Articles of Association of Nextel Holdings. AMX will place $30.0 million of the purchase price into an 18-month escrow account to secure NII’s indemnification obligations under the purchase agreement.
In addition, in connection with the Nextel Brazil transaction, NII and AI Brazil Holdings have entered into an agreement relating to the Nextel Brazil transaction that includes the resolution of a dispute regarding the investment of funds into Nextel Holdings from an escrow related to NII’s sale of its operations in Mexico, or the Mexico escrow, pursuant to which the parties have agreed that AI Brazil Holdings will receive, after the closing of the Nextel Brazil transaction, the first $10.0 million recovered from the Mexico escrow followed by 6% of the value of additional funds recovered from the Mexico escrow, in both cases, if and when funds are released. NII has also agreed to indemnify AI Brazil Holdings for damages that may arise from certain tax contingencies, transaction expenses, transaction-related litigation and other matters in connection with its participation in the Nextel Brazil transaction.
The closing of the transactions contemplated by the purchase agreement are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including approval of the stockholders of NII, receipt of required regulatory and antitrust approvals, and either an amendment eliminating the obligations contemplated under, or an escrow agreement providing for a deposit in accordance with, NII’s indenture with respect to our 4.25% convertible senior notes due 2023. 
The purchase agreement includes certain termination rights for each party and provides that, in specified circumstances, NII is required to pay a termination fee of $25.0 million. In the event that the purchase agreement is terminated because NII’s 
3


stockholders fail to approve the Nextel Brazil transaction, NII is obligated to reimburse AMX for its documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the purchase agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, up to $2.0 million. 
The purchase agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by NII, NIIH, AMX and AI Brazil Holdings. Among other things, NIIH has agreed to conduct NIIBH’s, and each of its subsidiaries’, business in the ordinary course, use reasonable best efforts to operate its business in accordance with its budget for the year 2019 and use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve its business organization and preserve certain business relations. 
In connection with the proposed sale of Nextel Brazil, NII’s Board of Directors has approved a plan to dissolve and wind up its headquarters upon the completion of this transaction, which is also subject to approval by NII’s stockholders.
Minority Investment
On June 5, 2017, the Company and AINMT Holdings AB, or ice group, an international telecommunications company operating primarily in Norway under the "ice.net" brand, along with certain affiliates of the Company and ice group, entered into an investment agreement and a shareholders agreement to partner in the ownership of Nextel Brazil. On July 20, 2017, ice group completed its initial investment of $50.0 million in Nextel Holdings S. à r.l., or Nextel Holdings, a newly formed subsidiary of the Company that indirectly owns Nextel Brazil, in exchange for 30% ownership in Nextel Holdings. In connection with the initial investment, ice group received 50.0 million shares of cumulative preferred voting stock in Nextel Holdings, and we received 116.6 million shares of common stock in this entity. The investment agreement also provided ice group with an option, exercisable on or before November 15, 2017, to invest an additional $150.0 million in Nextel Holdings for an additional 30% ownership. ice group did not exercise its option, and on February 27, 2018, we terminated the investment agreement. In September 2018, ice group completed the sale of its 30% ownership interest in Nextel Holdings by selling the shares of its intermediary holding company, AI Brazil Holdings, to AI Media Holdings (NMT) LLC (90%) and Bridford Music B.V. (10%). During 2018, AI Brazil Holdings made an additional $15.9 million investment in Nextel Holdings to maintain its current ownership level. Since we continue to have a controlling interest in Nextel Brazil, we have consolidated this entity and its subsidiaries.
The investment agreement provided for, after ice group’s initial investment, the Company's contribution of proceeds arising from the release of funds deposited in escrow in connection with the sale of our Mexican operations through a 115 account, which is a contribution without the issuance of additional equity. See Note 6 for more information regarding escrowed funds. Management does not believe that this requirement survives the termination of the investment agreement and intends for all future contributions by the Company to Nextel Holdings to be made through capital contributions with additional equity being issued to us. ice group and AI Brazil Holdings have notified the Company that they believe future escrow proceeds received by the Company from the escrow account must be contributed to Nextel Holdings through the 115 account without the issuance of equity, which would result in 30% of the disputed escrow being subject to AI Brazil Holdings' non-controlling interest. To the extent the Nextel Brazil transaction is not completed and the related settlement between us and AI Brazil Holdings is not consummated, AI Brazil Holdings’ non-controlling interest in future escrow proceeds received by the Company would remain in dispute.
Nextel Brazil Business Overview
We provide wireless communication services under the NextelTM brand in Brazil with our principal operations located in major urban and suburban centers with high population densities and related transportation corridors where there is a concentration of Brazil’s population and economic activity, including primarily Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Nextel Brazil operates a wideband code division multiple access, or WCDMA, network, which has been upgraded to offer long-term evolution, or LTE, services in certain areas. We are also a party to a roaming agreement that allows us to offer our subscribers nationwide voice and data services outside of our network's footprint. Our target market is individual consumers who use our services to meet both professional and personal needs. Our target subscribers generally exhibit above average usage, revenue and loyalty characteristics. We believe our subscribers are attracted to the services and pricing plans we offer, the quality of and data speeds provided by our network and our dedicated customer service. 
The services we currently offer include:

• | mobile telephone voice and wireless data services;


• | international voice and data roaming services; and


• | value-added services, including sports, music and entertainment streaming capabilities; online education; and access to national and international WiFi hotspot networks.

Our original network utilized integrated digital enhanced network, or iDEN, technology to provide mobile services on our 800 megahertz, or MHz, spectrum holdings. During the last several years, Nextel Brazil experienced iDEN subscriber losses and 
4


overall declines in its iDEN service revenue. In response to continued subscriber losses on its iDEN network, in September 2017, Nextel Brazil decided to wind down its iDEN operations. After migrating some subscribers to its WCDMA network, Nextel Brazil disconnected all of its remaining iDEN subscribers at the end of the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of our subscribers purchase services from us by acquiring subscriber identity module, or SIM, cards from us and using these SIM cards in handsets that they acquire separately from other sources. As of December 31, 2018, Nextel Brazil had about 3.31 million total subscriber units in commercial service, which we estimate to be about 4% of total postpaid mobile handsets and other devices in commercial service in Brazil. We refer to these subscriber units in commercial service collectively as our subscriber base.
Operating Strategy 
Pending the completion of the sale of Nextel Brazil, we expect to continue to operate our business in the ordinary course. Our goal is to grow our subscriber base and revenues by providing differentiated wireless communications services that are valued by our existing and potential subscribers. As discussed below, we have also been taking actions to reduce costs in our business to lower our spending and preserve our liquidity in the near term while improving our profitability and cash flow over the long term. Our strategy for achieving these goals is based on several core principles, including:

• | offering a unique and superior customer-centric experience, including a reliable and high quality wireless network and rate plan flexibility;


• | continuing to implement cost reduction strategies and reconfiguring our network architecture in order to lower cash costs per user, or CCPU, gain scale advantages, create an agile organization and improve overall profitability;


• | offering simple and valuable service plans that generate higher average revenue per user, or ARPU, and result in lower subscriber turnover; and


• | building on the strength of the unique positioning of the Nextel brand.

Our consolidated operating revenues declined by $250.0 million, or 29%, from 2017 to 2018, partially as a result of a $135.0 million decrease in iDEN-based operating revenues resulting from the wind down of Nextel Brazil's iDEN network in mid-2018. The remaining $115.0 million decrease in consolidated operating revenues was primarily the result of a 15% depreciation in the value of the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar and an 11% decrease in WCDMA service ARPU in local currency driven by competitive pricing pressure, partially offset by higher operating revenues generated from a larger WCDMA subscriber base in 2018. While we were able to reduce our cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses by 33% in 2018 to offset a portion of the decline in operating revenues, we generated a $41.9 million operating loss for the period, partially as a result of $18.9 million in net impairment, restructuring and other charges and $28.6 million in depreciation and amortization that we recognized in 2018. Due to improvements we made in our operations, our subscriber turnover levels were 96 basis points lower in 2018 than in 2017, resulting in 343,600 net WCDMA subscriber additions in 2018, which was a significant improvement from 3,600 net WCDMA subscriber additions in 2017. 
In recent years, we have implemented changes in our business to better align our organization and costs with our operational and financial results and improve our customers' experience. These changes have included a transition to lower cost subscriber acquisition channels, initiatives to improve the rendering of services while reducing operating costs, including headcount reductions, and projects designed to gain operational and capital expenditure efficiencies in Brazil, all of which were intended to reduce costs while maintaining the support necessary to meet our subscribers' needs. We expect that, if we can continue to maintain customer turnover levels similar to those experienced in 2018 and grow our WCDMA subscriber base, we will be able to generate higher operating revenues in the future. We are also continuing to focus on opportunities to reduce operating expenses through operational improvements and cost reductions to preserve our liquidity.

Economic Environment
Recently, Brazil experienced one of the worst economic recessions in its history, characterized by years of negative wage growth, a net loss of jobs, higher unemployment and lower consumer confidence. These economic conditions and trends resulted in a decline in the amount of consumer disposable income available to purchase telecommunications services and negatively impacted Nextel Brazil's results of operations for recent prior years. Recent data indicates that Brazil's economy is beginning to recover, but to date, the growth has been slow with gradual improvements. According to reports issued by the International Monetary Fund, Brazil's gross domestic product, or GDP, improved by about 1% in each of 2017 and 2018, but unemployment rates reached the highest in decades at approximately 12% at the end of 2018. Real wages in Brazil fluctuated but grew slightly from 2017 to 2018. The foreign currency exchange rate in Brazil depreciated in value by almost 15% relative to the U.S. dollar during 2018. 
Competitive Environment
We believe that the wireless communications industry in Brazil has been and will continue to be characterized by intense competition on the basis of price, the types of services offered, speed of data access and quality of service. In recent years, the prices we have been able to charge for services in Brazil have declined as a result of intensified price competition, including the introduction by our competitors of aggressive pricing promotions, such as plans that allow shared minutes between groups of callers and plans that provide more services and in many cases, unlimited calling, for lower rates than some of the plans we offer. Since the second half of 2017, Nextel Brazil has been offering unlimited voice rate plans on its WCDMA network and making other targeted efforts to promote customer loyalty and improve collections in response to the increasingly competitive environment. 
We compete with large, well-capitalized competitors in Brazil that have substantial financial and other resources. Nextel Brazil's largest competitors are Vivo, which is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the largest market share in the São Paulo metropolitan area and Rio de Janeiro; Claro, which is controlled by Mexico's America Movil; Telecom Italia Mobile, or TIM, a subsidiary of Italy's Telecom Italia; and TNL PCS S.A., a subsidiary of Telemar Norte Leste, Brazil's largest wireline incumbent, that offers its services under the brand name “Oi.” 
Many of our competitors have a larger spectrum position than ours, including more spectrum that can be used to support a wide range of wireless technologies, and have greater coverage areas and/or name recognition than we do, making it easier for them to expand into new markets and offer new products and services. Our competitors typically have more extensive distribution channels than ours or are able to use their scale advantages to acquire subscribers at a lower cost than we can, and they have implemented network technology upgrades, including both WCDMA and LTE, that support high speed data services. Some of these competitors also have the ability to offer bundled telecommunications services that include local, long distance, subscription television and data services, and can offer a larger variety of handsets and other devices with a wide range of prices, brands and features. In addition, the financial strength and operating scale of some of these competitors allows them to offer aggressive pricing plans, including those targeted at attracting our existing subscribers.
In recent years, our largest competitors have increasingly focused their marketing efforts on attracting postpaid subscribers within our target segments by, among other things, enhancing their network quality and their customer care functions, which may minimize the value of our network quality and speed and the quality of our customer service as points of differentiation. 
We compete with other communications service providers based primarily on our simple and attractive pricing plans, high quality customer experience and wireless service offerings. We are continuing to pursue our target market with an expanded message that focuses on our transition to a full service wireless operator capable of providing high quality and high speed data services supported by our WCDMA and LTE network. 
We believe that the users who primarily make up our targeted subscriber base are likely to base their purchase decisions on network quality and quality of customer support, as well as on the availability of differentiated features and services that make it easier for them to communicate quickly, efficiently and economically. However, because pricing is one of a number of important factors in potential customers' purchasing decisions, and in light of Brazil's recovering economy discussed above, increased price competition in the customer segments we target could require us to decrease prices or increase service and product offerings, which would lower our revenues, increase our costs or both.
In response to the aggressive nature of Brazil's competitive environment, as well as its recent economic climate, we have taken and are continuing to take the following actions: 

• | offering flexible rate plans in order to meet our customers' individualized needs, including various unlimited voice rate plans at competitive prices;


• | taking advantage of our smaller company size and flexibility to aggressively market to certain customer segments;


• | providing a superior customer-centric experience that cultivates a long-term relationship with our customers;


• | continuing to implement cost reduction strategies and reconfiguring our network architecture to reduce CCPU;

6



• | streamlining distribution channels, including closing unprofitable retail stores; and


• | reviewing commission and subsidy strategies.

As a result of these and other initiatives, in 2018, Nextel Brazil had 1.32 million gross WCDMA subscriber additions, 343,600 net WCDMA subscriber additions and WCDMA subscriber turnover of 2.61%.
Our Networks and Wireless Technologies
We currently offer services supported by a network that utilizes WCDMA and LTE technology. WCDMA is a standards-based technology being deployed by wireless carriers throughout the world that provides service capabilities such as high speed internet access, increased network capacity and reduced costs for voice and data services when compared to previous technologies. LTE is a standard for wireless data transmission on mobile devices that increases capacity and speed using a different radio interface together with core network improvements.
In late 2010, Nextel Brazil participated in a series of spectrum auctions and was the successful bidder for 20 MHz of spectrum in the 1.9/2.1 gigahertz, or GHz, spectrum bands in 11 of the 13 auction lots covering approximately 98% of the Brazilian population for $714.4 million based on foreign currency exchange rates at the time. Nextel Brazil also successfully bid on 20 MHz of spectrum in the 1.8 GHz band in Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and some states in the north and northeast regions of Brazil for a total bid price of approximately $121.7 million. Nextel Brazil is utilizing this 1.9/2.1 GHz spectrum to support its WCDMA network and is utilizing the 1.8 GHz spectrum to support its LTE-based network. The licenses relating to the spectrum won by Nextel Brazil in the auction were granted in June 2011 and have a term of 15 years. These licenses are renewable once for an additional 15-year period and require Nextel Brazil to meet specified network coverage construction requirements within specified timeframes. In December 2015, Nextel Brazil participated in a spectrum auction and was the successful bidder for 30 MHz of spectrum in the 1.8 GHz band for 455.0 million Brazilian reais, or approximately $116.7 million based on foreign currency exchange rates at the time. Nextel Brazil currently offers LTE services in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. These services are automatically available to subscribers with an existing mobile plan and compatible smartphone at no additional cost.
We continue to evaluate ways in which we can use our 800 MHz spectrum to support existing or new services. Our current 800 MHz spectrum holdings are largely contiguous, making it possible to use that spectrum to support future technologies, including LTE-based technologies, if certain technical, operational and regulatory requirements are met, including, for example, the availability of compatible network and subscriber equipment. The availability of that equipment will likely depend upon a number of factors, including the technology decisions made by other wireless carriers and the willingness of infrastructure and device manufacturers to produce the required equipment. 
Sales and Distribution
Our target customers include consumer market segments that value our attractive pricing plans, high quality network and our superior level of customer service, as well as the small, medium and large business markets that value our wireless services. We use a variety of distribution channels to reach our target customers, including direct sales representatives, indirect sales agents, retail stores and kiosks, and other subscriber-convenient sales channels such as online purchasing. Nextel Brazil is continuously optimizing its mix of sales channels to take into consideration the methods that best meet local subscriber preferences, most cost effectively sell and provide support to our different segments and facilitate our overall strategy of attracting and retaining subscribers in our targeted segments.
We employ sales representatives who market our services directly to potential and existing customers. The focus of our direct sales force is primarily on customers that value our industry expertise and services, as well as our ability to develop tailored custom communications capabilities that meet the specific needs of these customers. We also utilize indirect sales agents, which mainly consist of local and national non-affiliated dealers that solicit customers for our service and are generally paid through commissions. These dealers participate with Nextel Brazil's direct sales force in varying degrees when pursuing each of our targeted customer groups.
Our sales channels also include distribution through subscriber-convenient channels, including telesales and sales through our Nextel retail stores, shopping center kiosks and other locations. We have realigned these sales channels and locations and have also expanded our marketing through regional and national retailers with store kiosks and handset and prepaid card distribution offers. We also utilize our website as a marketing tool that allows subscribers to compare our various rate plans and research our suite of products and services, including handsets, accessories and special promotions. We use a digital platform and other online purchase tools as additional sales channels to allow subscribers to purchase our services directly without any interaction with a Nextel representative. Subscribers can purchase a SIM card at an accredited point of sale, install the SIM card on an Android or 
7


iOS smartphone, download the application, and activate and change rate plans. In 2018, we also began offering an express delivery option that delivers a SIM card to our subscribers within a 4-hour window in order to allow for immediate activation of service. 
Marketing
Since 2002, we have offered services under the Nextel brand under a trademark license agreement with Nextel Communications. As a result of our efforts, the Nextel brand is recognized in Brazil as standing for both quality of service and the customer support we provide. Our marketing strategy is focused on the availability of the broad range of services and features offered by our WCDMA and LTE networks that we believe appeals to a wide range of consumers. The positioning of our brand continues to focus on customers who are attracted to our services and our reputation for providing a high quality customer experience. 
Regulation of SMR and PCS Operations 
In Brazil, the wireless communications regulations are based on a concept called calling party pays, which requires the mobile carrier of the subscriber initiating a call to pay the mobile carrier of the party receiving the call when mobile calls occur between subscribers of different carriers. These calling party pays charges are based on rates that we refer to as mobile termination rates. In 2012, ANATEL, Brazil's telecommunications regulatory agency, approved regulations to implement a transition to a cost-based model for determining mobile termination rates. Under the current regulations, the mobile termination rates are being gradually reduced over a transition period ending in 2019, when cost-based rates will take effect and we will likely pay the same rates as our competitors.
Foreign Currency Controls, Dividends and Tax Regulation 
The purchase and sale of foreign currency in Brazil continues to be subject to regulation by the Central Bank of Brazil despite regulatory changes enacted in 2005 that were designed to reduce the level of government regulation of foreign currency transactions. The purchase of currency for repatriation of capital invested in Brazil and for payment of dividends to foreign stockholders of Brazilian companies may only be made if the original investment of foreign capital and capital increases were registered with the Brazilian Central Bank. Nextel Brazil has registered substantially all of its investments with the Brazilian Central Bank.
Brazilian law provides that the Brazilian government may, for a limited period of time, impose restrictions on the remittance by Brazilian companies to foreign investors of the proceeds of investments in Brazil whenever there is a material imbalance or a serious risk of a material imbalance in Brazil’s balance of payments. The Brazilian government may also impose restrictions on the conversion of Brazilian currency into foreign currency. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,640 employees, of which 2,626 were employees of Nextel Brazil. Nextel Brazil is a party to a legally mandated collective bargaining agreement that covers most of its employees and expires on August 31, 2019. NII Holdings is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. We believe that the relationship between us and our employees, and between Nextel Brazil and its employees, is good.
