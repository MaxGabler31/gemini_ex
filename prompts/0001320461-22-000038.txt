Corporate History and Business Developments
Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. was established in 2004 as a Delaware corporation and began operating on December 23, 2004 when it acquired the automotive segment of Cooper Tire & Rubber Company. Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. operates the business primarily through its principal operating subsidiary, Cooper-Standard Automotive Inc. (“CSA U.S.”). Since the 2004 acquisition, the Company has expanded and diversified its customer base through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions. 
In 2018, we established ATG, which incorporated our Industrial and Specialty Group, to accelerate and maximize the value stream of Cooper Standard’s materials science technology in industrial and specialty markets. We furthered the expansion of our Industrial and Specialty Group through the acquisition of Lauren Manufacturing and Lauren Plastics in 2018 and signed multiple joint development agreements for our Fortrex™ chemistry platform throughout 2018 to 2021.
In 2019, we finalized the divestiture of our anti-vibration systems business (“AVS”) product line within our North America, Europe and Asia Pacific segments. In 2020, we completed the divestiture of our European rubber fluid transfer and specialty sealing businesses, as well as our Indian operations.
Business Strategy
We have set a clear vision for achieving profitable growth with a defined, focused plan to return to double-digit return on invested capital (“ROIC”). At the beginning of 2022, the Company introduced a new Purpose Statement - Creating Sustainable Solutions Together - which represents the importance of sustainability for the long-term health of the business as a whole and the sustained value that we work each day to deliver to our stakeholders (customers, investors, employees, suppliers and communities). Our key strategic imperatives are defined as:

Financial Strength: | Execute our Driving Value plan, achieving and sustaining double digit adjusted EBITDA margins and ROIC. 
Growth – Building For The Future: | Leverage our materials science and manufacturing expertise. Pursue opportunities for both organic and inorganic growth. Continue to build an exceptional workforce.
World-Class Functional Expertise and Execution: | Attain world-class results across all functions allowing the Company to be the first choice of our stakeholders. 
Sustainability: | Deliver value to all our stakeholders through Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Company. 

Cooper Standard’s global alignment around these imperatives continues to drive further value in many areas of the business, including: 
Operational and Strategic Initiatives
As part of Cooper Standard’s world-class operations, the Company implemented CSOS (Cooper Standard Operating System) to fully position the Company for growth and ensure global consistency in engineering design, program management, manufacturing process, purchasing and IT systems. Standardization across all regions is especially critical in support of customers’ global platforms that require the same design, quality and delivery standards everywhere across the world. As a result of these initiatives, the Company has leveraged CSOS to drive an average savings from improved operating efficiency of approximately $60 million each of the past five years. 
In addition, as part of our continued focus on sustainability and corporate responsibility, Cooper Standard recently formed a Global Sustainability Council to provide executive level oversight for the Company’s sustainability strategy and ensure alignment and integration with business goals and stakeholder priorities. The council maintains a holistic look at the Company’s ESG (environmental, social and governance) initiatives, tracks rapidly evolving best practices and further develops long-term goals to drive world-class ESG performance.
Cooper Standard continues to progress its diversification strategy through its Advanced Technology Group which is charged with accelerating and maximizing expertise in the Company’s core process types for applications in the industrial and specialty markets. This business also drives growth and diversification through the Company’s applied materials science offerings, which include the Fortrex™ chemistry platform that provides performance advantages over many other materials, as well as a significantly reduced carbon footprint.
The Company’s CS Open Innovation initiative aims to position Cooper Standard as the partner of choice for start-ups, universities and other suppliers through a proactive outreach program. The initiative is focused in the areas of materials science, manufacturing and process technology, digital/artificial intelligence and advanced product technology. 
In addition, the Company has implemented its Driving Value plan to return to double-digit adjusted EBITDA margins and ROIC to help deliver sustained value for all of our stakeholders.
Leverage Technology and Materials Science for Innovative Solutions
We utilize our technical and materials science expertise to provide customers with innovative solutions. Our engineers combine product design with a broad understanding of materials science for enhanced vehicle performance. We believe our 
reputation for successful innovation in product design and materials is the reason our customers consult us early in their vehicle development and design process of their next generation vehicles.
Cooper Standard utilizes its i3 Innovation Process (Imagine, Initiate, Innovate) and CS Open Innovation as mechanisms to capture ideas while promoting a culture of innovation. Ideas are carefully evaluated by our global technology council, and those that are selected are put on an accelerated development cycle. We are developing innovative technologies based on materials expertise, process know-how, and application vision, which may drive future product direction. Fortrex™, the Company’s chemistry platform, offers reduced weight while delivering superior material performance and aesthetics. We have also developed several other significant technologies, especially related to advanced materials, processing and weight reduction. These include: FlushSeal™, an advanced integrated solution for frame under glass static sealing systems offering better appearance, improved aerodynamics, quieter ride and reduced weight; MagAlloy™, a processing technology for brake lines that increases long term durability through superior corrosion resistance; and Easy-Lock™, a small package coolant and fuel vapor quick connect. Given the trajectory and anticipated future growth of electric vehicles, Cooper Standard has developed innovations to provide lightweight plastic tubing with our PlastiCool® 2000 multilayer tubing, smooth and CVT mid temperature multilayer tubing, and our next generation Ergo-Lock™ and Ergo-Lock™ + VDA quick connectors for glycol thermal management needs.
Among our newer technologies is Cooper Standard’s artificial intelligence (A.I.)-enhanced development cycle for polymer compounds that has shortened material development times while realizing rapid discovery of new compounds that offer superior performance properties, which yield superior products. We have also developed proprietary technology for A.I.-enhanced continuous processes controls. This technology enables full automation of polymer extrusion and other complex continuous processes, reducing process variation (a top driver of scrap), increasing product quality, improving operational metrics and reducing our carbon footprint.
Our innovations are receiving industry recognition. Cooper Standard has been named a General Motors Overdrive Award winner for Fortrex® in the category of ‘Sustainability’, in addition to the chemistry platform being named a 2018 Automotive News PACE Award winner and a 2018 and 2019 Society of Plastics Engineers Innovation Award finalist. Also, Cooper Standard’s artificial intelligence-enhanced development cycle for polymer compound development was named a finalist for the 2019 Automotive News PACE Awards.
Pursue Acquisitions and Alliances to Enhance Capabilities and Accelerate Growth
We may, from time to time, consider and selectively pursue complementary acquisitions and joint ventures to enhance our customer base, geographic penetration, scale and technology. Consolidation is an industry trend, which has been encouraged by the OEMs’ desire for global automotive suppliers. We believe we have a strong platform for growth through acquisitions based on our past integration successes, experienced management team, global presence and operational excellence. 
Industry
The automotive industry is one of the world’s largest and most competitive markets. Consumer demand for new vehicles largely determines sales and production volumes of global OEMs. The business and commercial environment in each region also plays a role in vehicle demand as it relates to fleet vehicle sales and industrial use vehicles such as light and heavy trucks.
OEMs compete for market share in a variety of ways including pricing and incentives, the development of new, more attractive models, branding and advertising, and the ability to customize vehicle features and options to meet specific consumer needs or demands. They rely heavily on thousands of specialized suppliers to provide the many distinct components and systems that comprise the modern vehicle. They also rely on these automotive suppliers to develop technological innovations that will help them meet consumer demands as well as regulatory requirements. 
The supplier industry is a highly competitive industry and is generally characterized by high barriers to entry, significant start-up costs and long-standing customer relationships. The criteria by which OEMs judge automotive suppliers include quality, price, service, performance, design and engineering capabilities, innovation, timely delivery, financial stability and global footprint. Over the last decade, suppliers that have been able to achieve manufacturing scale globally, reduce structural costs, diversify their customer base and provide innovative, value-added technologies have been the most successful.
The technology of today’s vehicles is evolving rapidly. This evolution is being driven by many factors including consumer preferences and social behaviors, a competitive drive for differentiation, regulatory requirements, environmental impact and safety. Cooper Standard supports these trends by providing innovations that reduce weight, increase life-cycle and durability, reduce interior noise, enhance exterior appearance, simplify the manufacturing and assembly process, and help reduce a vehicle’s environmental impact. These are innovations that can be applicable and valuable to virtually any vehicle (including internal combustion, hybrid or battery electric powertrains) or vehicle manufacturer and, in many cases, can also be transferred 
to non-automotive applications in adjacent markets. Cooper Standard remains closely aligned with our customers and is prepared to meet their evolving needs as they shift their fleets and offer more EV options. We are focused on growing our business in the EV segment by leveraging our technology and innovation to provide value-add solutions for increasingly specialized technical requirements.

2020 | $ | 101.6 | | 4.3 | %
2019 | $ | 114.9 | | 3.7 | %

Intellectual Property
We believe that one of our key competitive advantages is our ability to translate customer needs and our ideas into innovation through the development of intellectual property. We hold a significant number of patents and trademarks worldwide.
Our patents are grouped into two major categories: (1) specific product invention claims and (2) specific manufacturing processes that are used for producing products. The vast majority of our patents fall within the product invention category. We consider these patents to be of value and seek to protect our rights throughout the world against infringement. While in the aggregate these patents are important to our business, we do not believe that the loss or expiration of any one patent would materially affect our Company. We continue to seek patent protection for our new products and we develop significant technologies that we treat as trade secrets and choose not to disclose to the public through the patent process. These technologies nonetheless provide significant competitive advantages and contribute to our global leadership position in various markets. We believe that our trademarks, including FlushSeal™, Gen III Posi-Lock™, Easy-Lock™, MagAlloy™, Ergo-Lock™, Ergo-Lock™ +, PlastiCool® 2000 and Fortrex™, help differentiate us and lead customers to seek our partnership.
We also have technology sharing and licensing agreements with various third parties, including Nishikawa Rubber Company, one of our joint venture partners in sealing products. We have mutual agreements with Nishikawa Rubber Company for sales, marketing and engineering services on certain sealing products. Under those agreements, each party pays for services provided by the other and royalties on certain products for which the other party provides design or development services. We also have licensing and joint development agreements for commercial applications of our Fortrex™ chemistry platform in non-automotive industries.
Innovation, Materials, and Product Lifecycle 
The international response to risks and opportunities of climate change is transforming our global economy. Our most significant opportunity to contribute to this low-carbon and circular economy is through the sustainability impacts of our products. We purposefully apply sustainable principles in the design and production of our products, reducing the environmental impact from sourcing through end-of-life. These efforts also enable our customers to reduce their environmental impacts. 
When obtaining or innovating materials for our products, we seek to sustainably source raw materials, increase the use of recycled content or recyclable material where feasible, decrease our use of hazardous chemicals where possible, and properly 
disclose restricted materials to customers and regulators. We believe our culture of innovation is a key differentiator, allowing us to compete and succeed within our dynamic global markets. 
Supplies and Raw Materials
Cooper Standard is committed to building strong relationships with our supply partners. We recognize the importance of engaging with suppliers to create value for our customers.
The principal raw materials for our business include synthetic and natural rubber, carbon black, process oils, and plastic resins. Principal procured components are primarily made from plastic, carbon steel, aluminum and stainless steel. We manage the procurement of our direct and indirect materials to assure supply continuity and to obtain the most favorable total cost. Procurement arrangements include short-term and long-term supply agreements that may contain formula-based pricing, based on commodity indices. These arrangements provide quantities needed to satisfy normal manufacturing demands. We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our products with suppliers located around the world, although we continue to manage, with our supplier partners, short-term disruptions in production and logistics throughout our supply chain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Raw material prices are susceptible to fluctuations which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain. Costs related to raw materials, such as steel, aluminum, and oil and oil-derived commodities, continue to be volatile, which led to extended and magnified increases in these costs in 2021. It is generally difficult to pass through such increases to our customers. As such, we have implemented strategies with both our suppliers and our customers to help manage these fluctuations. These actions include material substitutions and leveraging global purchases. Our global supply chain optimization efforts include using benchmarks and selective sourcing from strategic suppliers. We have also made process improvements to ensure the efficient use of materials through scrap reduction, as well as standardization of material specifications to maximize leverage over higher volume purchases. With some suppliers, on certain raw materials, we have implemented indices that allow price changes as underlying material costs fluctuate. 
Seasonality
Our principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Sales to OEMs are lowest during the months prior to model changeovers or during assembly plant shutdowns. Automotive production is traditionally reduced during July, August and year-end holidays, and our quarterly results may reflect these trends. However, economic conditions and consumer demand may change the traditional seasonality of the industry. In 2021, while demand remained strong, production was more volatile due to supply chain disruptions, which resulted in late-notice shutdowns of certain customer facilities for an intermediate period of time. 
Backlog
Our OEM sales are generally based upon purchase orders issued by the OEMs, with updated releases for volume adjustments. As such, we typically do not have a firm and definitive backlog of orders at any point in time. Once selected to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the platform life, which is normally five to eight years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform, although there is no guarantee that this will occur.
Human Capital and Safety
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 22,600 employees, including 2,600 contingent workers. We maintain good relations with both our union and non-union employees and, in the past ten years, have not experienced any major work stoppages. We renegotiated some of our non-domestic union and works council agreements in 2021, and have several contracts set to expire in the next twelve months. 
Our people have always been the driving force of value at Cooper Standard. The emergence of new ways of working during the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing international movement for civil rights, and our unwavering dedication to keeping our employees healthy and safe has only made them more critical to our success. We accomplish this by developing the capabilities of our employees through continuous learning and performance management processes. Additionally, building an internal talent pipeline supports the achievement of this priority. In 2021, our internal fill rate was approximately 60%. This metric, which is based on salaried director level positions and above, helps us to understand where employees are advancing in their career and the effectiveness of our internal development programs. For 2021, our voluntary employee turnover rate was approximately 20%. While this metric has increased compared to prior years and despite the current competitive environment for talent, we believe that our culture and continued effort to provide our employees with growth opportunities contributes to retaining our strong talent. 
In addition, we aim to diversify our workforce because we recognize the value of engaging different opinions and backgrounds in a global company. We are committed to recruiting, developing and retaining a high-performing and diverse workforce. A global measurement for our diversity is women in the company and women in leadership. In 2021, women made up approximately 38% of our workforce. Of our leadership positions, defined as vice president positions and above, women held approximately 22% of such roles. 
Safety continues to be a top priority and primary focus of management. An emphasis on reducing workplace incidents helps Cooper Standard to maintain a safe workforce and continue to deliver world class results for product quality. In 2021, our total incident rate (“TIR”) was 0.40, which represents an Occupational Safety and Health Administration measurement of on-the-job injuries in relation to total hours worked. Based on our review of industry peer sustainability reports, we have a lower TIR relative to our peer group. Additionally, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees while meeting the needs of our customers. After the onset of COVID-19, we adopted enhanced safety measures and practices across our facilities to protect employee health and safety and ensure a reliable supply of products to our customers. We monitor and track the impact of the pandemic on our employees and within our operations and proactively modify or adopt new practices to promote their health and safety.
Also in 2021, the Company was named to Newsweek’s list of America’s Most Responsible Companies for the third consecutive year and was recognized as one of the 2021 World’s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere for the second consecutive year. These awards are a further testament to Cooper Standard’s commitment to ESG (environmental, social and governance) topics, including our core value of integrity.
Community Involvement
Supported by the Cooper Standard Foundation, our employees are highly engaged in their local communities. The Foundation’s mission is to strengthen the communities where Cooper Standard employees work and live through the passionate support of children’s charities, education, health and wellness, and community revitalization. The Cooper Standard Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization with oversight by its Board of Directors, Board of Trustees and Philanthropic Committee. For more information on the Company’s community involvement, please visit our Corporate Responsibility Report located on the Cooper Standard website. 
Environmental
Cooper Standard considers itself a steward of the environment, and we monitor the environmental impact of our business and products. We prioritize our environmental management as a means of driving and sustaining excellence. We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, and local environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations in the United States and other countries, including regulations governing: emissions to air, discharges to water, noise and odor emissions; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, reclamation and disposal of chemicals and waste materials; the cleanup of contaminated properties; and human health and safety. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. While our costs to defend and settle known claims arising under environmental laws have not been material in the past and are not currently estimated to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, such costs could be material to our financial statements in the future. Further details regarding our commitments and contingencies are provided in Note 21. “Contingent Liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Report”).
