Item 1.  Business
 U.S. Concrete, Inc. is a Delaware corporation founded and incorporated in 1997. In this report, we refer to U.S. Concrete, Inc. and its subsidiaries as "we," "us," "our," the "Company," or "U.S. Concrete," unless we specifically state otherwise, or the context or content indicates otherwise.
General
Our principal business is producing ready-mixed concrete and supplying aggregates in select geographic markets in the United States, U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada. We are a leading supplier for large-scale commercial and industrial, residential and infrastructure (including streets, highways and other public works) construction projects in high-growth markets across the country. We hold leading ready-mixed concrete market positions in New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Dallas-Fort Worth and Washington, D.C., and our materials have been used in some of the most complex and highly specialized construction projects of the last decade. U.S. Concrete has continued to grow both organically and through a series of strategic acquisitions of independent producers in our target markets. 
We operate principally in the Atlantic Region (which we define to include New York, New Jersey, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania), Texas / Oklahoma, and the West Coast Region (which we define to include California and British Columbia, Canada) with those markets representing approximately 34%, 34% and 31%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue for 2018. We believe we are well positioned for strong growth in these attractive regions. 
Total revenue for 2018 was $1.5 billion, of which we derived approximately 86.7% from our ready-mixed concrete segment, 9.1% from our aggregate products segment (excluding $46.1 million sold internally) and 4.2% from our other operations. For 2018, we had net income attributable to U.S. Concrete of $30.0 million. 
We serve substantially all segments of the construction industry in our select geographic markets. Our customers include contractors for commercial and industrial, residential and infrastructure. Ready-mixed concrete product revenue by type of construction activity for the past three years was:

 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016
Commercial and industrial | 56% | 56% | 58% 
Residential | 25% | 26% | 26% 
Infrastructure | 19% | 18% | 16% 

In 2017, we completed our largest acquisition to date with the purchase of Polaris Materials (“Polaris”), a construction aggregate producer in British Columbia, Canada. This acquisition added a significant amount of aggregates production and reserves to our portfolio. The Polaris acquisition represented a key step in our vertical integration growth strategy. Beyond our own traditional regions, we also serve aggregates-only markets in Southern California and Hawaii. Also in 2017, we acquired Corbett Aggregate Companies, LLC ("Corbett") located in Quinton, New Jersey, another significant step in vertically integrating our operations. Corbett provides a critical component to our aggregates needs in New York City, through our New York Sand & Stone business unit and their network of aggregates terminals. 
In 2015, we completed a significant ready-mixed concrete acquisition of Ferrara Bros. Building Materials, in Queens, New York. This acquisition significantly expanded our footprint in New York City and allowed us to serve all five boroughs. In subsequent acquisitions in 2016, we completed a series of acquisitions of Jenna Concrete, Nycon Supply Co. and Kings Ready Mix as part of a strategy to strengthen and expand our New York City operations. These acquisitions expanded our ready-mixed concrete operations, adding New York as a major contributor to our success.

Our Competitive Strengths
Our competitive strengths lie in manufacturing and delivering high-performance concrete in challenging, urban markets. We are well positioned to supply large, complex projects through our unique plant networks in large metropolitan markets that are difficult to serve. Such projects include infrastructure projects with complex Federal Highway Administration or Federal Aviation Administration specifications and high levels of delivery requirements. Through this operational excellence, we can leverage our competitive strengths by testing and then sharing best practices among our operating units. 
Our ability to source raw materials further adds to our operational excellence, continuing to enhance our competitive strengths. Our aggregate and sand vertical integration in areas of the country where aggregates are expensive and depleting, coupled with our water borne and strategically located docks further strengthens our self-supply model.
While zoning and permitting regulations make it difficult to permit new quarries and ready-mixed concrete plants in many of the markets we serve, the barriers to entry also make our market positions more valuable. Our ability to internally source aggregates requirements for our most challenging projects, and in every market we serve, gives us a distinct competitive strength. 
Our comprehensive asset base enables greater efficiencies and asset utilization, while scale leverages purchasing power advantages and delivery and asset utilization efficiencies. To further enhance our asset base, we have increased our investment in technology to drive continued improvements, such as our proprietary dispatch and analytics system, Where’s My ConcreteTM. 
Sustainability and environmentally friendly solutions continue to grow and be in high demand in our industry. We take pride in our leadership and commitment to deliver these critical solutions. We were the first company in the U.S. concrete industry to adopt the 2030 Challenge to develop Environmental Product Declarations ("EPD") for our ready-mixed concrete products. This challenge, issued by Architecture 2030, calls on architecture, planning and building industries worldwide to specify, design and manufacture products that meet specific carbon reduction targets between now and the year 2030. Our operating unit in Northern California, Central Concrete Supply Co., was the first of our business units to adopt the challenge, and our EPD adoption spread across the company. Currently, our operating units combined have over 13,000 EPDs.
Beyond EPDs, we have found a competitive strength in low CO2 concrete mix designs aimed at reducing a construction project's total carbon footprint. Our early development of EF® Technology lead to development and adoption of many CO2 reducing capabilities from raw material substitution to injecting CO2 into concrete mixes. Many of these sustainability measures also positively affect the performance of the final product, giving us a value proposition of multiple competitive strengths. 
Our national research laboratory, while working closely with each of our regional laboratories, is developing industry leading solutions and ensuring local capability needs are met. Concrete mix design expertise and the ability to meet stringent specifications through the work of these labs is yet another competitive strength that ties the more upstream raw material sourcing and asset base to our downstream value-added products.
Our ability to replicate this model successfully through strategic acquisitions is another competitive strength. Our mergers and acquisitions team has deep industry relationships, which facilitate proprietary sourcing of successful acquisitions. A repeatable acquisition and integration process maximizes our synergies. 
These strengths give us distinct competitive advantages, and together have allowed us to grow and continue our positive momentum into the future. The ability to self-supply aggregates and use our technical expertise to design and track our shipments, coupled with our intense focus on operational excellence will further our model of continuous improvement. 
Our Business Strategy 
We strive to be the top one or two producer in the ready-mixed concrete markets we serve and operate in some of the fastest growing and most attractive metropolitan markets in the United States, including New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Dallas/Fort Worth and Washington, D.C. These markets represent five of the top 12 metropolitan statistical areas. 
Our business is uniquely local. Given the relatively low selling price of aggregates, transportation costs can quickly exceed the product cost. Further, due to the chemical reaction while in the mixer truck, concrete is a perishable product and must be unloaded within 60 to 90 minutes from being loaded from the concrete batch plant. 
2

Our business strategies are (1) market focus, including growing our markets through acquisitions, (2) vertically integrate through aggregates, (3) do what we know, and (4) focus on growing profits. 
Market focus - Go where the people are
Markets drive our strategic growth initiatives. There are 11 identified megaregions in the United States that drive 75% of the gross domestic product and house 70% of the nation’s population, but only represent 15% of the U.S. land mass. By focusing on these megaregions, we can be very deliberate on how and when we enter markets. Further, by being selective on which markets we want to be in and the projects we want to pursue, we can spend more time on developing relationships with the targets we prioritize. We are focused on building strong, defensible positions in strong, growing and vibrant markets, which are virtually impossible to replicate. 
Vertically integrate through aggregates
Our ready-mixed concrete operations consume a significant amount of aggregates. Aggregates are a major component in ready-mixed concrete, comprising approximately 75% by weight. We believe those ready-mixed concrete operations where we are vertically integrated through aggregates have a competitive advantage. Internally sourcing aggregates provides a consistent and reliable stream of raw materials for our ready-mixed concrete operations. In addition to consuming high margin aggregates internally, third party sales are available for other aggregate products. These high margin sales enhance our profitability. Aggregates also provide an additional growth segment for the Company to expand through strategic acquisitions.
Do what we know
We would expect to be a leading supplier of building materials in our current and future markets. We are dedicated to increasing our aggregates positions and related downstream products, such as ready-mixed concrete, in the future. 
Drive margin improvement 
We are focused on driving continuous improvement, resulting in increasing profit margins. We are best in class in ready-mixed concrete margins, but there is still more work to be done. We will continue to push new technology, sales programs, raw material sourcing, and any opportunity to drive more profit while operating safely. 
Our Industry
Ready-mixed concrete manufacturers produce concrete and deliver it in an unhardened state to end users, such as contractors, who then pour and form the concrete at construction sites. Downstream applications include commercial, industrial, residential, infrastructure, and other construction sectors. The industry is composed of varying sized family owned businesses to multi-national corporations. As concrete is a perishable product, production facilities are typically located within 60 to 90 minutes from construction projects. The National Ready Mixed Concrete Association (“NRMCA”) estimated there were about 5,500 ready-mixed concrete plants and 55,000 ready-mixed concrete mixer trucks that delivered approximately 351 million cubic yards of product to the point of placement, accounting for $35 billion in revenue across the United States in 2017. 
The aggregates industry produces engineered granular materials consisting of crushed stone, gravel, and sand of varying mineralogies, manufactured to specific grades and sizes for use in downstream construction applications. Crushed stone, sand, and gravel are used as aggregate in foundations for infrastructure and buildings or as road base. Crushed stone is also an input to cement, concrete products, and personal consumer goods. The Phoenix Center for Advanced Legal & Economic Public Policy Studies estimates the aggregates industry generates $27 billion in annual revenue and accounts for more than 100,000 jobs. The industry is highly competitive, with more than 4,000 private companies and government agencies producing approximately 2.3 billion tons annually. Due to high transportation costs, approximately 90% of aggregates are consumed within 50 miles of the place of extraction. 
The key industry drivers include infrastructure funding, residential construction spending, private nonresidential construction spending, fluctuations in interest rates, weather conditions, and national, regional and local economic conditions. Ready-mixed concrete and aggregates are used in streets and highways, foundations and suspended floors, tilt walls, transportation terminals, sporting stadiums and petrochemical plants, among other uses. Private investment is influenced by long-term interest rates. A low inflationary outlook and interest rate stability foster investment in construction markets, which increases the demand for ready-mixed concrete and aggregates.

Our Products
Ready-mixed concrete 
Our standard ready-mixed concrete products consist of proportioned mixes we produce and deliver in an unhardened plastic state for placement and shaping into designed forms at the job site. Selecting the optimum mix for a job entails determining not only the ingredients that will produce the desired permeability, strength, appearance and other properties of the concrete after it has hardened and cured, but also the ingredients necessary to achieve a workable consistency considering the weather and other conditions at the job site. We believe we can achieve product differentiation for the mixes we offer because of the variety of mixes we can produce, our volume production capacity and our scheduling, delivery and placement reliability. Additionally, we believe our environmentally friendly technology initiative, which utilizes alternative materials and mix designs that result in lower CO2 emissions, helps differentiate us from our competitors. We also believe we distinguish ourselves with our value-added service approach that emphasizes reducing our customers’ overall construction costs by reducing the in-place cost of concrete and the time required for construction. 
Our volumetric concrete operations, the largest volumetric operation in the country, expand our ready-mixed concrete delivery and service offerings primarily in Texas. Volumetric ready-mixed concrete trucks mix concrete to the customer's specification on the job site, better serving smaller jobs and specialized applications, and allowing flexibility for servicing remote job locations. Because of their versatility, these trucks offer the contractor multiple options for a single job without the inconvenience or added costs typically associated with standard ready-mixed trucks delivering special or short-loads to a job site. Because of their unique on-demand production capabilities, these trucks minimize the amount of wasted concrete, which improves margins and reduces environmental impact. 
We also provide portable and mobile concrete plants for high-volume or remote projects. Our fast-track mobilization business unit, U.S. Concrete On-Site, Inc., can dispatch a portable or mobile ready-mixed concrete plant anywhere in the continental U.S. These mobile solutions have reached an exceptional level of turnkey operations customized to deliver outstanding on-site solutions for all types of concrete construction, throughout the country. Not only are we providing industry leading concrete production operations to our customers, we are providing technical services and a substantial mitigation of risk with on-site production. 
Aggregate products
We produce crushed stone, sand and gravel from 19 aggregates facilities located in New Jersey, Texas, Oklahoma, the U.S. Virgin Islands and British Columbia, Canada. We sell these aggregates for use in commercial, industrial and public works projects in the markets they serve, as well as consume them internally in the production of ready-mixed concrete in those markets. We produced approximately 10.4 million tons of aggregates during the year ended December 31, 2018, with British Columbia, Canada representing 48%, Texas / Oklahoma representing 30%, New Jersey representing 19% and the U.S. Virgin Islands representing 3% of the total production. While we consume some of this production internally, we sell the majority of our aggregate products to third parties. We believe our aggregates reserves provide us with additional raw materials sourcing flexibility and supply availability.
Other
Other products include our building materials stores, hauling operations, aggregates distribution terminals, a recycled aggregates operation and concrete blocks. Two specific products included in this category are ARIDUS® Rapid Drying Concrete technology and the Where’s My Concrete family of web and mobile applications. 
ARIDUS Rapid Drying Concrete reduces the drying time and risks associated with excess moisture vapor in concrete slabs, enabling faster, more effective floor topping installations. ARIDUS was developed and patented by U.S. Concrete’s National Research Laboratory, USC Technologies, Inc., to address changes in environmental government regulations that limit or restrict volatile organic compounds in flooring adhesives. 
Where’s My Concrete is our real-time cloud-based data delivery program that helps concrete producers provide value-added service and transparency to their customers, while improving their own business through critical analytics and operational efficiencies. We use this program in our operations as well as market it to third parties.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
We obtain most of the raw materials necessary to manufacture ready-mixed concrete on a daily basis. These materials include water, cement and other cementitious materials (such as fly ash and slag), aggregates (stone, gravel, and sand), and chemical admixtures. A standard cubic yard of concrete typically weighs 4,125 pounds and includes approximately 250 pounds of water, 550 pounds of cementitious material, 1,525 pounds of sand, and 1,800 pounds of stone. 
Cement is the binding agent used to bind water, crushed stone, and sand, in the production of ready-mixed concrete. Other industrial byproducts such as fly ash from coal burning power plants and slag from the manufacture of iron and silica fume have cementitious properties that allow it to be used as a substitute for cement, depending on specification. We purchase cementitious materials from a few suppliers in each of our major geographic markets. Aggregates are typically produced locally and are procured from a network of internal and external suppliers in each of our markets. In 2018, our ready-mixed concrete businesses purchased 32% of their aggregate products needs from internally operated quarries and sites. Chemical admixtures are generally purchased from suppliers under national purchasing agreements. 
With the exception of chemical admixtures, each plant typically maintains an inventory level of these materials sufficient to satisfy its operating needs for a few days. Inventory levels do not decline significantly or comparatively with declines in revenue during seasonally lower periods. We generally maintain inventory at specified levels to maximize purchasing efficiencies and to be able to respond quickly to customer demand. Generally, we negotiate with suppliers on a company-wide basis and at the local market level to obtain the most competitive pricing available. 
Competition
The ready-mixed concrete industry is highly competitive. Our leadership position in a market depends largely on the location and operating costs of our plants and prevailing prices in that market. Price is the primary competitive factor among suppliers for small or less complex jobs, such as residential construction. However, the ability to meet demanding specifications for strength or sustainability, timeliness of delivery and consistency of quality and service, in addition to price, are the principal competitive factors among suppliers for large or complex jobs. Our competitors range from small, owner-operated private companies to subsidiaries of operating units of large, vertically integrated manufacturers of cement and aggregates. Our vertically integrated competitors generally have greater financial and marketing resources than we have, providing them with a competitive advantage. Competitors having lower operating costs than we do or having the financial resources to enable them to accept lower margins than we do will have a competitive advantage over us for jobs that are particularly price-sensitive. Competitors having greater financial resources or less financial leverage than we do may be able to invest more in new mixer trucks, ready-mixed concrete plants and other production equipment or pay for acquisitions, which could provide them a competitive advantage over us. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 740 salaried employees, including executive officers and management, sales, technical, administrative and clerical personnel and 2,561 hourly personnel. The number of employees fluctuates depending on the number and size of projects ongoing at any particular time, which may be impacted by variations in weather conditions throughout the year.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
A wide range of federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations apply to our operations, including the following matters:

• | water usage;


• | land usage;


• | street and highway usage;


• | noise levels; and


• | health, safety and environmental matters.

In many instances, we are required to have various certificates, permits, or licenses to conduct our business. Our failure to maintain these required authorizations or to comply with applicable laws or other governmental requirements could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations. Delays in obtaining approvals for the transfer or grant of authorizations, or failures to obtain new authorizations, could impede acquisition efforts.
Environmental laws that impact our operations include those relating to air quality, solid waste management and water quality. These laws are complex and subject to frequent change. They impose strict liability in some cases without regard to negligence or fault. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. In addition, businesses may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. These laws also may expose us to liability for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others or for acts that complied with all applicable laws when performed.
We have conducted Phase I environmental site assessments, which are non-intrusive investigations conducted to evaluate the potential for significant on-site environmental impacts, on substantially all the real properties we own or lease and have engaged independent environmental consulting firms to complete those assessments. We have not identified any environmental concerns associated with those properties that we believe are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, but we can provide no assurance material liabilities will not occur. In addition, our compliance with any amended, new or more stringent laws, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the future discovery of environmental conditions could require additional, material expenditures.
We believe we have all material permits and licenses we need to conduct our operations and are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements relating to our operations. We purchased certain emissions credits for $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2018 to expand our sales capacity in California for Polaris aggregate products.
