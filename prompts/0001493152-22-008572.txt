Recent Events
 
Reverse Stock Split
 
On February 7, 2022, we effectuated a reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock at a ratio of 1-for-80. The share numbers and pricing information in this annual report are adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.
Public Offering and Uplisting to Nasdaq
 
On February 9, 2022, we closed on an underwritten public offering of 2,530,121 units (the “Common Units”), at a price to the public of $4.15 per Common Unit, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $10.5 million, prior to deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other estimated offering expenses. Each Common Unit consisted of one share of Common Stock and one warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock (each a “Warrant” and collectively the “Warrants”). The Common Stock and Warrants were immediately separable from the Common Units and were issued and trade separately. The Warrants are exercisable immediately, expire five years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $5.1875 per share.
 
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay various outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, including working capital, increased research and development expenditures and funding our growth strategies.
 
The shares of Common Stock and Warrants were approved to list on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “AREB” and “AREBW,” respectively, and began trading on February 7, 2022.

Corporate Summary
 
American Rebel Holdings, Inc. was incorporated on December 15, 2014, in the State of Nevada and is authorized to issue 600,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock of $0.001 par value.
 
The Company operates primarily as a marketer and designer of branded safes and personal security and self-defense products. Additionally, the Company designs and produces branded apparel and accessories.
 
We believe that when it comes to their homes, consumers place a premium on their security and privacy. Our products are designed to offer our customers convenient, efficient and secure home and personal safes from a provider that they can trust. We are committed to offering products of enduring quality that allow customers to keep their valuable belongings protected and to express their patriotism and style, which is synonymous with the American Rebel brand.

We believe our products are designed to safely store firearms, as well as store our customers’ priceless keepsakes, family heirlooms and treasured memories, and we aim to make our products accessible at various price points for home use. We believe our products are designed for safety, quality, reliability, features and performance.

To enhance the strength of our brand and drive product demand, we work with our sole supplier and manufacturer to emphasize product quality and mechanical development in order to improve the performance and affordability of our products while providing support to our distribution channel and consumers. We seek to sell products that offer features and benefits of higher-end safes at mid-line price ranges.
 
We believe that safes are becoming a ‘must-have appliance’ in a significant portion of households. We believe our current safes provide safety, security, style and peace of mind at competitive prices. We are in the process of developing an additional newly designed model safe, which is expected to be produced in the U.S. We anticipate our new model safe will offer and be equipped with technologically advanced features, such as independent bolt works operation, double-steel door-jamb framing, and a standardized geared locking mechanism.
 
In addition to branded safes, we offer an assortment of personal security products as well as apparel and accessories for men and women under the Company’s American Rebel brand. Our backpacks utilize what we believe is a distinctive sandwich-method concealment pocket, which we refer to as Personal Protection Pocket, to hold firearms in place securely and safely. The concealment pockets on our Freedom 2.0 Concealed Carry Jackets incorporate a silent operation opening and closing with the use of a magnetic closure.
 
We believe that we have the potential to continue to create a brand community presence around the core ideals and beliefs of America, in part through our Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. “Andy” Ross, who has written, recorded and performs a number of songs about the American spirit of independence. We believe our customers identify with the values expressed by our Chief Executive Officer through the “American Rebel” brand.
 
Through our growing network of dealers, we promote and sell our products in select regional retailers and local specialty safe, sporting goods, hunting and firearms stores, as well as online, including our website and e-commerce platforms such as Amazon.com.
 
American Rebel is boldly positioning itself as “America’s Patriotic Brand” in a time when national spirit and American values are being rekindled and redefined. American Rebel is an advocate for the 2nd Amendment and conveys a sense of responsibility to teach and preach good common practices of gun ownership. American Rebel products keep you concealed and safe inside and outside the home. American Rebel Safes protect your firearms and valuables from children, theft, fire and natural disasters inside the home; and American Rebel Concealed Carry Products provide quick and easy access to your firearm utilizing American Rebel’s Proprietary Protection Pocket in its backpacks and apparel outside the home. The initial company product releases embrace the “concealed carry lifestyle” with a focus on concealed carry products, apparel, personal security and defense. “There’s a growing need to know how to protect yourself, your family, your neighbors or even a room full of total strangers,” says American Rebel’s CEO, Andy Ross. “That need is in the forethought of every product we design.”
 
The “concealed carry lifestyle” refers to a set of products and a set of ideas around the emotional decision to carry a gun everywhere you go. The American Rebel brand strategy is similar to the successful Harley-Davidson Motorcycle philosophy, referenced in this quote from Richard F. Teerlink, Harley’s chairman and former chief executive, “It’s not hardware; it is a lifestyle, an emotional attachment. That’s what we have to keep marketing to.” As an American icon, Harley has come to symbolize freedom, rugged individualism, excitement and a sense of “bad boy rebellion.” American Rebel – America’s Patriotic Brand has significant potential for branded products as a lifestyle brand. Its innovative Concealed Carry Product line and Safe line serve a large and growing market segment; but it is important to note we have product opportunities beyond Concealed Carry Products and Safes.

American Rebel Safes
 
Keeping your guns in a location only appropriate trusted members of the household can access should be one of the top priorities for every responsible gun owner. Whenever a new firearm is purchased, the owner should also look for a way to store and secure it. Storing the firearm in a gun safe will prevent it from being misused by young household members, and it will also prevent it from being stolen in a burglary or damaged in a fire or natural disaster. Gun safes may seem pricy at first glance, but once the consumer is educated on their role to protect expensive firearms and other valuables such as jewelry and important documents, the price is justified.
 
American Rebel produces large floor safes in a variety of sizes as well as small portable keyed safes. Additional opportunities exist for the Company to develop Wall Safes and Handgun Boxes.
 
Reasons gun owners should own a gun safe:
 

● | If you are a gun owner and you have children, many states have a law in place that you have to have your gun locked in a safe, away from children. This will prevent your children from getting the gun and hurting themselves or someone else. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Some states have a law in place that you have to keep your gun locked away when it is not in use even if you don’t have children in your home. California has a law that you have to have your gun locked in a firearms safety device that is considered safe by the California Department of Justice (DOJ). When you buy a safe, you should see if it has approval from the California DOJ. 
● | Many gun owners own more guns than insurance will cover. Many insurance companies only cover $3,000 worth of guns. Are your weapons worth more? If so, you should invest in a gun safe to make sure your guns are protected from fire, water, and thieves. 
● | Many insurance companies may give you a discount if you own a gun safe. If you own a gun safe or you purchase one, you should see if your insurance company is one that offers a discount for this. A safe can protect your guns and possibly save you money. 
● | Do people know you own guns? You might not know that many burglaries are carried out by people they know. 
● | If a person you know breaks into your home, steals your gun, and murders someone you could be charged with a crime you didn’t commit, or the victim’s family could sue you. 
● | Gun safes can protect your guns in the event your home goes up in flames. When buying a safe, you should see if it will protect your firearm or any other valuables from fire damage. 
● | You might be the type of person that has a gun in your home for protection. A gun locked in a safe can still offer you protection. There are quick access gun safes on the market. With a quick access gun safe, you can still retrieve your gun in a few seconds, but when it isn’t needed it will be protected. 

 
A gun safe is the best investment a gun owner can make because the safe can protect guns from thieves, fire, water, or accidents. Bills or ballot measures to require safe storage have been discussed in Delaware, Washington, Oregon, Missouri and Virginia; and various laws are on the books in California and Massachusetts. Even a figure as staunchly pro-gun as Texas’s Republican lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, called on gun-owning parents to lock up their weapons after the Santa Fe shooting. The gun safe industry is experiencing rapid growth and innovation. American Rebel CEO Andy Ross and the rest of the American Rebel team are committed to fulfilling the opportunity in the gun safe market and filling the identified void with American Rebel Gun Safes.

Below is a summary of the different safes we offer:
 

i. | Large Safes – our current large model safe collection consists of six premium safes. All of our large safes share the same high-quality workmanship, are constructed out of 11-gauge U.S.-made steel and feature a double plate steel door, double-steel door casements and reinforced door edges. Each of these safes provide up to 75 minutes of fire protection at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit. Our safes offer a fully adjustable interior to fit our customers’ needs. Depending on the model, one side of the interior may have shelves and the other side set up to accommodate long guns. There are optional additions such as Rifle Rod Kits and Handgun Hangers to increase the storage capacity of the safe. These large safes offer greater capacity for secure storage and protection, and our safes are designed to prevent unauthorized access, including in the event of an attempted theft, natural disaster or fire. We believe that a large, highly visible safe also acts as a deterrent to any prospective thief. 
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. | Personal Safes – the safes in our compact safe collection are easy to operate and carry as they fit into briefcases, desks or under vehicle seats. These personal safes meet Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) airline firearm guidelines and fit comfortably in luggage when required by travel regulations. 
iii. | Vault Doors – our U.S.-made vault doors combine style with theft and fire protection for a look that fits any decor. Newly-built, higher-end homes often add vault rooms and we believe our vault doors, which we designed to facilitate secure access to such vault rooms, provide ideal solutions for the protection of valuables and shelter from either storms or intruders. Whether it’s in the context of a safe room, a shelter, or a place to consolidate valuables, our American Rebel in- and out-swinging vault doors provide maximum functionality to facilitate a secure vault room. American Rebel vault doors are constructed of 4 ½” double steel plate thickness, A36 carbon steel panels with sandwiched fire insulation, a design that provides greater rigidity, security and fire protection. Active boltworks, which is the locking mechanism that bolts the safe door closed so that it cannot be pried open and three external hinges that support the weight of the door, are some of the features of the vault door. For safety and when the door is used for a panic or safe room, a quick release lever is installed inside the door. 
iv. | Dispensary Safes - our HG-INV Inventory Safe, a safe tailor-made for the cannabis community, provides cannabis and horticultural plant home growers a reliable and safe solution to protect their inventory. Designed with medical marijuana or recreational cannabis dispensaries in mind and increasing governmental and insurance industry regulation to lock inventory after hours, we believe our HG-INV Inventory Safe delivers a high-level user experience. 

Upcoming Product Offerings
 
To further complement our diverse product offerings, we intend to introduce additional products in 2022. Below is a summary of our upcoming product offerings:
 
i. Biometrics Safes – we will be introducing our line of handgun boxes with biometrics, WiFi and Bluetooth technologies. These Biometric Safes have been designed, engineered and are ready for production.
 
ii. Personal Security Device – we are developing a non-lethal device that deters an attacker with an audible siren, which would draw attention to the attacker, as well as notifying the user’s support network that help is needed and providing the location of the attack.
 
iii. Wall Safes – wall safes can be easily hidden and provide “free” storage space since they are able to be tucked into the space between your wall and studs.
 
iv. Youth Protection Backpack – with the objective of keeping kids safe at school, we are designing the Youth Protection Backpack, which will incorporate a light-weight ballistic shield to provide protection when needed for our children as they go through their school day activities.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we are progressing toward long-term, sustainable growth, and our business has, and our future success will be driven by, the following competitive strengths:
 
● Powerful Brand Identity – we believe we have developed a distinctive brand that sets us apart from our competitors. This has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our brand is predicated on patriotism and quintessential American character: protecting our loved ones. We strive to equip our safes with technologically advanced features that offer customers advanced security to provide the peace of mind they need. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing the “American Rebel” brand is critical to expanding our loyal enthusiasts base, network of dealers and other partners. Through our branded apparel and accessories, we seek to further enhance our connection with the American Rebel community and share the values of patriotism and safety for which our Company stands for. We strive to continue to meet their need for our safes and our success will depend largely on our ability to maintain customer trust, become a gun safe storage leader and continue to provide high-quality safes.
 
● Product Design and Development – our current safe model relies on time-tested features, such as Four-Way Active Boltworks, pinning the door shut on all four sides (compared to Three-Way Bolt works, which is prevalent in many of our competitors’ safes), and benefits that would not often be available in our price point, including 11-gauge US-made steel. The sleek exterior of our safes has garnered attention and earned the moniker from our dealers as the “safe with an attitude.” When we set out to enter the safe market, we wanted to offer a safe that we would want to buy, one that would get our attention and provide excellent value for the cost.
 
● Focus on Product Performance - since the introduction of our first safes, we have maintained a singular focus on creating a full range of safe, quality, reliable safes that were designed to help our customers keep their family and valuables safe at all times. We incorporate advanced features into our safes that are designed to improve strength and durability. Key elements of our current model safes’ performance include:
 
Double Plate Steel Door - 4 ½” Thick
 Reinforced Door Edge – 7/16” Thick
 Double-Steel Door Casement
 Steel Walls – 11-Gauge
 Diameter Door Bolts – 1 ¼” Thick
 Four-Way Active Boltworks – AR-50(14), AR-40(12), AR-30(10), AR-20(10), AR-15(8), AR-12(8)
 Diamond-Embedded Armor Plate
 
* Double Plate Steel Door is formed from two U.S.-made steel plates with fire insulation sandwiched inside. Thicker steel is placed on the outside of the door while the inner steel provides additional door rigidity and attachment for the locking mechanism and bolt works. The door edge is reinforced with up to four layers of laminated steel. Pursuant to industry-standard strength tests performed, this exclusive design offers up to 16 times greater door strength and rigidity than the “thin metal bent to look thick” doors.
 
* Double-Steel Door Casement is formed from two or more layers of steel and is welded around the perimeter of the door opening. Pursuant to industry-standard strength tests performed, it more than quadruples the strength of the door opening and provides a more secure and pry-resistant door mounting. Our manufacturer installs a Double-Steel Door Casement™ on our safes. We believe the reinforced door casement feature provides important security as the safe door is often a target for break-in attempts.
 
* Diamond-Embedded Armor Plate Industrial diamond is bonded to a tungsten steel alloy hard plate. Diamond is harder than either a cobalt or carbide drill. If drilling is attempted the diamond removes the cutting edge from the drill, thus dulling the drill bit to where it will not cut.
 
● Trusted Brand - we believe that we have developed a trusted brand with both retailers and consumers for delivering reliable, secure safe solutions.
 
● Customer Satisfaction - we believe we have established a reputation for delivering high-quality safes and personal security products in a timely manner, in accordance with regulatory requirements and our retailers’ delivery requirements and supporting our products with a consistent merchandising and marketing message. We also believe that our high level of service, combined with strong consumer demand for our products and our focused distribution strategy, produces substantial customer satisfaction and loyalty. We also believe we have cultivated an emotional connection with the brand which symbolizes a lifestyle of freedom, rugged individualism, excitement and a sense of bad boy rebellion.
 
● Proven Management Team - our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. Ross, Jr., has led the expansion and focus on the select product line we offer today. We believe that Mr. Ross had an immediate and positive impact on our brand, products, team members, and customers. Under Mr. Ross’s leadership, we believe that we have built a strong brand and strengthened the management team. We are refocusing on the profitability of our products, reinforcing the quality of safes to engage customers and drive sales. We believe our management team possesses an appropriate mix of skills, broad range of professional experience, and leadership designed to drive board performance and properly oversee the interests of the Company, including our long-term corporate strategy. Our management team also reflects a balanced approach to tenure that will allow the Board to benefit from a mix of newer members who bring fresh perspectives and seasoned directors who bring continuity and a deep understanding of our complex business.

Our Growth Strategy
 
Our goal is to enhance our position as a designer, producer and marketer of premium safes and personal security products. We have established plans to grow our business by focusing on three key areas: (1) organic growth and expansion in existing markets; (2) targeted strategic acquisitions that increase our on-premise and online product offerings, distributor and retail footprint and/or have the ability to increase and improve our manufacturing capabilities and output, and (3) expanding the scope of our operation activities to the dispensaries U.S. community.
 
We have developed what we believe is a multi-pronged growth strategy, as described below, to help us capitalize on a sizable opportunity. Through methodical sales and marketing efforts, we believe we have implemented several key initiatives we can use to grow our business more effectively. We believe we have made significant progress in 2021 in the largest growing segment of the safe industry, sales to first-time buyers. We also intend to opportunistically pursue the strategies described below to continue our upward trajectory and enhance stockholder value. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are as follows:
 
Organic Growth and Expansion in Existing Markets - Build our Core Business
 
The cornerstone of our business has historically been our safes product offering. We are focused on continuing to develop our home, office and personal safes product lines. We are investing in adding what we believe are distinctive technology solutions to our safes.
 
We are also working to increase floor space dedicated to our safes and strengthen our online presence in order to expand our reach to new enthusiasts and build our devoted American Rebel community. We intend to continue to endeavor to create and provide retailers and customers with what we believe are responsible, safe, reliable and stylish products, and we expect to concentrate on tailoring our supply and distribution logistics in response to the specific demands of our customers.
 
We are currently developing a new additional model of our home and office safes. Our new safe model, which we expect to introduce at industry trade shows in 2022, is to be built in the U.S. through our collaboration with Industrial Maintenance Incorporated (“IMI”). The new “Made in the USA” safe model is expected to be manufactured in Topeka, Kansas, and is ready to begin production. We believe IMI’s location is very advantageous, as it is located near our sales office in Lenexa, Kansas.
 
We expect the new planned model to include additional features, such as a reinforced door and upgraded locking mechanism, and increased fire rating, among others. We are focused on developing a best in class, compelling combination of functionality, convenience and style without compromising the performance of our safes. We intend to use our designing and developing processes to enhance technological and time to market advantages over incumbent safe manufacturers.
 
While we currently rely on third-party manufacturers for the production of our current line of safes, apparel and accessories, we believe that the expected addition of manufacturing capabilities following the signing of the contract with the aforementioned manufacturer, which we anticipate to work exclusively with us, would allow us, among other benefits, to ramp up our production levels to meet expected demand for our products, provide us greater autonomy over the manufacturing process, and add what we believe are distinctive features.

Additionally, our Concealed Carry Product line and Safe line serve a large and growing market segment. We believe that interest in safes increase, as well as in our complimentary concealed carry backpacks and apparel as a byproduct, when interest of the general population in firearms increase. To this extent, the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which we believe serves as a proxy for gun sales since a background check is generally needed to purchase a firearm, reported a record number of background checks in 2020, 39,695,315. The prior annual record for background checks was 2019’s 28,369,750. In 2021, there were 38,876,673 background checks conducted, similar to that of 2020’s annual record which was 40% higher than the previous annual record in 2019. While we do not expect this increase in background checks to necessarily translate to an equivalent number of additional safes purchased, we do believe it might be an indicator of the increased demand in the safe market. In addition, certain states (such as Massachusetts, California, New York and Connecticut) are starting to legislate new storage requirements in respect of firearms, which is expected to have a positive impact on the sale of safes.
 
We continue to strive to strengthen our relationships and our brand awareness with our current distributors, dealers, manufacturers, specialty retailers and consumers and to attract other distributors, dealers, and retailers. We believe that the success of our efforts depends on the distinctive features, quality, and performance of our products; continued manufacturing capabilities and meeting demand for our safes; the effectiveness of our marketing and merchandising programs; and the dedicated customer support.
 
In addition, we seek to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty by offering distinctive, high-quality products on a timely and cost-attractive basis and by offering efficient customer service. We regard the features, quality, and performance of our products as the most important components of our customer satisfaction and loyalty efforts, but we also rely on customer service and support for growing our business.
 
Furthermore, we intend to continue improving our business operations, including research and development, component sourcing, production processes, marketing programs, and customer support. Thus, we are continuing our efforts to enhance our production by increasing daily production quantities through equipment acquisitions, expanded shifts and process improvements, increased operational availability of our equipment, reduced equipment down times, and increased overall efficiency.
 
We believe that by enhancing our brand recognition, our market share might grow correspondingly. Industry sources estimate that 70 million to 80 million people in the United States own an aggregate of more than 400 million firearms, creating a large potential market for our safes and personal security products. We are focusing on the premium segment of the market through the quality, distinctiveness, and performance of our products; the effectiveness of our marketing and merchandising efforts; and the attractiveness of our competitive pricing strategies.
 
Targeted Strategic Acquisitions for Long-term Growth
 
We are consistently evaluating and considering acquisitions opportunities that fit our overall growth strategy as part of our corporate mission to accelerate long-term value for our stockholders and create integrated value chains.
 
Along these lines, in March of 2022 we entered into a letter of intent (“LOI”) to purchase a safe manufacturer. The final structure of the acquisition will be determined by the parties following the receipt of tax, corporate and securities law advice. The acquisition will be structured as an arm’s length transaction and pursuant to the terms of the LOI the parties intend to sign a definitive agreement in respect of the acquisition on or before April 30, 2022. Under the terms of the LOI, we would acquire all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the acquisition target, free and clear of all encumbrances for a combination of cash and stock. As part of the LOI, we gave the target a $250,000 non-refundable deposit, which will be credited to us at closing. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including but not limited to the following key conditions: the target obtaining an audit of its financial statements; execution of the definitive and ancillary agreements; completion of mutually satisfactory due diligence; us obtaining sufficient financing to complete the acquisition; and receipt of all required regulatory, corporate and third-party approvals, and the fulfillment of all applicable regulatory requirements and conditions necessary to complete the acquisition. 
 
Expanding Scope of Operations Activities by Offering Servicing Dispensaries and Brand Licensing
 
We continually seek to target new consumer segments for our safes. As we believe that safes are becoming a must-have household appliance, we strive to establish authenticity by selling our products to additional groups, and to expand our direct-to-consumer presence through our website and our showroom in Lenexa, Kansas.
 
Further, we expect the cannabis dispensary industry to be a material growth segment for our business. Several cannabis dispensary operators have expressed interest in the opportunity to help them with their inventory locking needs. Cannabis dispensaries have various insurance requirements and local ordinances requiring them to secure their inventory when the dispensary is closed. Dispensary operators have been purchasing gun safes and independently taking out the inside themselves to allow them to store cannabis inventory. Recognizing what seems to be a growing need for cannabis dispensary operators, we have designed a safe tailor-made for the cannabis industry. With the legal cannabis hyper-growth market expected to exceed $43 billion by 2025, and an increasing number of states where the growth and cultivation of cannabis is legal (California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington), we believe we are well positioned to address the need of dispensaries. American Rebel has a long list of dispensary operators, growers, and processors interested in the Company’s inventory control solutions. We believe that dispensary operators, growers, and processors are another fertile new growth market for our Vault Doors products, as many in the cannabis space have chosen to install entire vault rooms instead of individual inventory control safes—the American Rebel Vault Door has been the choice for that purpose.

Further, we believe that American Rebel has significant potential for branded products as a lifestyle brand. As the American Rebel Brand continues to grow in popularity, we anticipate generating additional revenues from licensing fees earned from third parties who wish to engage the American Rebel community. While the Company does not generate material revenues from licensing fees, our management believes the American Rebel brand name may in the future have significant licensing value to third parties that seek the American Rebel name to brand their products to market to the American Rebel target demographic. For example, a tool manufacturer that wants to pursue an alternative marketing plan for a different look and feel could license the American Rebel brand name for their line of tools and market their tools under our distinct brand. This licensee would benefit from the strong American Rebel brand with their second line of American Rebel branded tools as they would continue to sell both of the lines of tools. Conversely, American Rebel could potentially also benefit as a licensee of products. If American Rebel determines a third party has designed, engineered, and manufactured a product that would be a strong addition to the American Rebel catalog of products, American Rebel could license that product from the third-party and sell the licensed product under the American Rebel brand.

We are in the process of developing an additional newly designed model safe, which is expected to be produced in the U.S. We anticipate our new model safe will offer and be equipped with technologically advanced features, such as independent boltworks operation, double-steel door-jamb framing, and a standardized geared locking mechanism.
 
In addition to branded safes, we offer an assortment of personal security products as well as apparel and accessories for men and women under the Company’s American Rebel brand. Our backpacks utilize what we believe is a distinctive sandwich-method concealment pocket, which we refer to as Personal Protection Pocket, to hold firearms in place securely and safely. The concealment pockets on our Freedom 2.0 Concealed Carry Jackets incorporate a silent operation opening and closing with the use of a magnetic closure.
 
We believe that we have the potential to continue to create a brand community presence around the core ideals and beliefs of America, in part through our Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. “Andy” Ross, who has written, recorded and performs a number of songs about the American spirit of independence. We believe our customers identify with the values expressed by our Chief Executive Officer through the “American Rebel” brand.
 
Through our growing network of dealers, we promote and sell our products in select regional retailers and local specialty safe, sporting goods, hunting and firearms stores, as well as online, including our website and e-commerce platforms such as Amazon.com.

Our Products
 
We design, market and sell branded safes and personal security products, including concealed carry/self-defense products, and design and market an apparel line and complimentary accessories. We promote and sell our products primarily through retailers using a dealer network, as well as online, through our website, and on Amazon.com, where customers can place an order for our branded backpacks and apparel items.
Safes
 
We offer a wide range of home, office and personal safe models, in a broad assortment of sizes, features and styles, which are constructed with U.S.-made steel. Our safes exhibit the strength and rugged independence that America was built upon. American Rebel’s design makes keeping your firearms more secure in style. Products are marketed under the American Rebel brand. Although demand for our safes is strong across all segments of our customers, including individuals and families who wish to protect their valuables, to collectors and the dispensary servicing community, the demand for safe storage responsible solutions has been particularly strong among gun owners, sportsmen, competitive shooters and hunters alike. We expect to benefit from increasing awareness of and need for safe storage of firearms in future periods.
Large Safes
 
Our large safe collection consists of six safes in a range of sizes. All of our large safes share the same high-quality workmanship, are constructed out of 11-gauge U.S.-made steel and feature a double plate steel door, double-steel door casements and reinforced door edges. We believe that our large safes are ideal for storing valuables of significant size, and that they offer greater capacity for storage and protection. Our safes offer a fully adjustable interior to fit our customers’ needs. Depending on the model, one side of the interior may have shelves and the other side set up to accommodate long guns. The large safes are designed to be resistant to break-ins, natural disasters and fire damage, and to prevent unauthorized access and to protect your family and their valuables. A large, highly visible safe also is believed to act as a deterrent to any prospective thief. Safe storage is also top priority of our customer base who seeks to responsibly secure their firearms. Whenever a new firearm is purchased, gun owners look for our premium solution to responsibly secure them and protect their loved ones.
 
Our large safes selection includes the following:
 
AR-50
 
The AR-50 is our biggest safe. The AR-50 safe is designed to be strong, rugged, constructed of 11-gauge American-made steel and maintains capacity to comfortably store over 40 firearms comfortably. This premium gun safe with a double plate steel door, double-steel door casement and reinforced door edge is designed to give our customers added security and peace of mind, with 75 minutes of fire protection at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit as well as a customized shelf solution and optional additional accessories to increase the capacity to hold firearms. 72” tall, 40” wide with a depth of 28.5”.
 
AR-40
 
The AR-40 has the same footprint as the AR-50; however, it is 12” shorter with a capacity of over 30 firearms. This gun safe contains a double plate steel door, double-steel door casement and reinforced door edge, designed to give our customers secure storage. It provides 75 minutes of fire protection at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit as well as a flexible shelving system to accommodate firearm storage. The dimensions include 60” tall, 40” wide with a depth of 28.5”.

This gun safe contains a double plate steel door, double-steel door casement and reinforced door edge. It is designed to give our customers the ability to store their firearms and valuables securely, with 75 minutes of fire protection at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit as well as offering optional add-on accessories to increase storage capacity.

The dimensions include 60” tall, 28” wide with a depth of 22.5”.
 
AR-15
 
The AR-15 fits the bill for narrow spaces with room for over 10 firearms. Same quality construction as our other large safes including a double plate steel door, double-steel door casement and reinforced door edge is designed to give our customers added security and peace of mind, with 75 minutes of fire protection at 1200 degrees Fahrenheit as well as a customized shelving solution.

Personal safes
 
Our compact safes, which come in two sizes, are a responsible solution to safely secure smaller valuables or handguns. The AR-110 weighs 5 pounds and is 9.5” x 6.5” x 1.75”. The AR-120 weighs 6 pounds and is 10.5” x 7.5” x 2.1875”. These small, personal safes are easy to operate and carry as they fit into a briefcase, desk or under a vehicle seat. These personal safes meet (“TSA”) airline firearm guidelines and fit comfortably in luggage where travel regulations require it.
 
Vault doors
 
Our U.S.-made Vault Doors combine style with theft and fire protection for a look that fits any decor. Designed to offer superior protection, vault rooms provide an ideal solution for the protection of the family and any valuables. Newly-built, higher-end homes often add vault rooms and we believe our vault doors, which we designed to facilitate secure access to such vault rooms, provide ideal solutions for the protection of valuables and shelter from either storms or intruders. Whether it is a safe room, a shelter, or a place to consolidate valuables, our American Rebel In-Swinging and Out-Swinging Vault Doors provide maximum functionality to a secure vault room. American Rebel vault doors are constructed of two thick, A36 carbon steel panels with sandwiched fire insulation, a design that provides greater rigidity, security and fire protection. The active boltworks and three external hinges are some of the features of the vault door. For safety and to use the door for a panic or safe room door, a quick release lever is installed inside the door.

Dispensaries
 
Our inventory control safe, the HG-INV Inventory Safe, provides cannabis dispensaries a reliable and safe solution. With wide-spread legalization, medical marijuana or recreational cannabis dispensaries face increasing government regulation and insurance requirements to lock their inventory after hours. Our HG-INV Inventory Safe delivers a higher level user experience with customized shelving and our inventory notation system. The HG-INV has been introduced to the dispensary industry through trade show appearances and many of our dealers are actively cultivating dispensary business. Expanding our marketing of the HG-INV can open new markets to American Rebel.

We believe these distinctive concealed carry products are designed for everyday use while keeping your firearm concealed, safe and easily accessible.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we are moving forward on a path to long-term, sustainable growth, and our business has, and our future success will be driven by, the following competitive strengths:

● | Powerful Brand Identity – we believe we have developed a strong brand that sets us apart from our competitors. We believe this is a distinguishing factor and will contribute to the future success of our business. Our brand is predicated on patriotism and quintessential American character: protecting our loved ones. We strive to equip our safes with technologically advanced features that offer customers advanced security to provide the peace of mind they need. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing the “American Rebel” brand is critical to expanding our loyal enthusiasts base, network of dealers and other partners. Through branded apparel and accessories, we seek to further develop our connection with the American Rebel community and share the values of patriotism and safety that our Company stands for. We strive to continue to meet their demand for our premium safes and will depend largely on our ability to maintain customer trust, be a gun safe storage leader and continue to provide high-quality safes,

● | Product Design and Development – our current safe model relies on what we believe are time-tested features, such as Four-Way Active Boltworks, pinning the door shut on all four sides when Three-Way Boltworks are standard in our competitors’ safes, and benefits that would not often be available in our price point, including 11-gauge US-made steel. The sleek exterior of our safes has garnered attention and earned the moniker from our dealers as the “safe with an attitude.” When we set out to enter the safe market, we wanted to offer a safe that we would want to buy, one that would get our attention and provide excellent value for the cost. 


● | Focus on Product Performance - since the introduction of our first safes, we have maintained a singular focus on creating a full range of safe, quality, reliable safes that were designed to help our customers keep their family and valuables safe at all times. We incorporate advanced features into our safes that are designed to improve strength and durability. Key elements of our safes’ performance include:

Double Plate Steel Door - 4 ½” Thick
 Reinforced Door Edge – 7/16” Thick
 Double-Steel Door Casement
 Steel Walls – 11-Gauge
 Diameter Door Bolts – 1 ¼” Thick
 Four-Way Active Boltworks – AR-50(14), AR-40(12), AR-30(10), AR-20(10), AR-15(8), AR-12(8)
 Diamond-Embedded Armor Plate
 
* Double Plate Steel Door is formed from two American-made steel plates with fire insulation sandwiched inside. Thicker steel is placed on the outside of the door while the inner steel provides additional door rigidity and attachment for the locking mechanism and bolt works. The door edge is reinforced with up to four layers of laminated steel. This exclusive design offers up to 16 times greater door strength and rigidity than the “thin metal bent to look thick” doors.
 
* Double-Steel Door Casement is created from two or more layers of steel welded around the perimeter of the door opening. It more than quadruples the strength of the door opening and provides a more secure and pry-resistant door mounting. Our manufacturer installs a Double-Steel Door Casement on all of its models. Most of our competitors do not offer the reinforced door casement.
 
* Diamond-Embedded Armor Plate - Industrial diamond is bonded to a tungsten steel alloy hard plate. Diamond is harder than either a cobalt or carbide drill. If drilling is attempted the diamond removes the cutting edge from a drill – thus dulling the drill bit to where it will not cut.
 


● | Trusted Brand - we believe that we have developed a trusted brand with both retailers and consumers for delivering reliable, secure safe solutions. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Customer Satisfaction - we believe we have established a reputation for delivering high-quality safes and personal security products in a timely manner, in accordance with regulatory requirements and our retailers’ delivery requirements and supporting our products with a consistent merchandising and marketing message. We also believe that our high level of service, combined with strong consumer demand for our products and our focused distribution strategy, produces substantial customer satisfaction and loyalty. We also believe we have cultivated an emotional connection with the brand which symbolizes a lifestyle of freedom, rugged individualism, excitement and a sense of bad boy rebellion. 
● | Proven Management Team - our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. Ross, Jr., has led the expansion and focus on the select product line we offer today. We believe that Mr. Ross had an immediate and positive impact on our brand, products, team members, and customers. Under Mr. Ross’s leadership, we believe that we have built a strong brand and strengthened the management team. We are refocusing on the profitability of our products, reinforcing the quality of safes and engaging customers and driving sales. We believe our management team possess an appropriate mix of skills, broad range of professional experience, and leadership designed to drive board performance and properly oversee the interests of the Company, including our long-term corporate strategy. Our management team also reflects a balanced approach to tenure that will allow the Board to benefit from a mix of newer directors who bring fresh perspectives and seasoned directors who bring continuity and a deep understanding of our complex business.

Our Growth Strategy
 
Our goal is to enhance our position as a designer, producer and marketer of premium safes and personal security products. We have established plans to grow our business by focusing on three key areas: (1) organic growth and expansion in existing markets; (2) targeted strategic acquisitions that increase our on-premise and online product offerings, distributor and retail footprint and/or have the ability to increase and improve our manufacturing capabilities and output, and (3) expanding the scope of our operation activities to the dispensaries U.S. community.
 
We have developed what we believe is a multi-pronged growth strategy, as described below, to help us capitalize on a sizable opportunity. Through methodical sales and marketing efforts, we believe we have implemented several key initiatives we can use to grow our business more effectively. We believe we have made significant progress in 2021 in the largest growing segment of the safe industry, sales to first-time buyers. We also intend to opportunistically pursue the strategies described below to continue our upward trajectory and enhance stockholder value. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are as follows:
 
Organic Growth and Expansion in Existing Markets - Build our Core Business
 
The cornerstone of our business has historically been our safes product offering. We are focused on continuing to develop our home, office and personal safes product lines. We are investing in adding what we believe are distinctive technology solutions to our safes.
 
We are also working to increase floor space dedicated to our safes and strengthen our online presence in order to expand our reach to new enthusiasts and build our devoted American Rebel community. We intend to continue to endeavor to create and provide retailers and customers with what we believe are responsible, safe, reliable and stylish products, and we expect to concentrate on tailoring our supply and distribution logistics in response to the specific demands of our customers.
 
We are currently developing an additional new model of our home and office safes. Our new safe model, which we expect to introduce at industry trade shows in 2022, is to be built in the U.S. We expect the new planned model to include additional features, such as a reinforced door and upgraded locking mechanism, among others. We are focused on developing a best in class, compelling combination of functionality, convenience and style without compromising performance of our safes. We intend to use our designing and developing processes to enhance technological and time to market advantages over incumbent safe manufacturers.
 
While we currently rely on third-party manufacturers for the production of our current line of safes, apparel and accessories, we believe that the expected addition of manufacturing capabilities following the signing of the contract with the aforementioned US manufacturer, which we anticipate to work exclusively with us, would allow us, among other benefits, to ramp up our production levels to meet expected demand for our products, provide us greater autonomy over the manufacturing process, and add what we believe are distinctive features.
 
Additionally, our Concealed Carry Product line and Safe line serve a large and growing market segment. We believe that interest in safes increase, as well as in our complimentary concealed carry backpacks and apparel as a byproduct, when interest of the general population in firearms increase. To this extent, the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which we believe serves as a proxy for gun sales since a background check is generally needed to purchase a firearm, reported a record number of background checks in 2020, 39,695,315. The prior annual record for background checks was 2019’s 28,369,750. In 2021, there were 38,876,673 background checks conducted, similar to that of 2020’s annual record which was 40% higher than the previous annual record in 2019. While we do not expect this increase in background checks to necessarily translate to an equivalent number of additional safes purchased, we do believe it might be an indicator of the increased demand in the safe market. In addition, certain states (such as Massachusetts, California, New York and Connecticut) are starting to legislate new storage requirements in respect of firearms, which is expected to have positive impact on the sale of safes.
 
We continue to strive to strengthen our relationships with our current distributors, dealers, manufacturers and specialty retailers and to attract other distributors, dealers, and retailers. We believe that the success of our efforts depends on the distinctive features, quality, and performance of our products; continued manufacturing capabilities and meeting demand for our safes; the effectiveness of our marketing and merchandising programs; and the dedicated customer support.
 
In addition, we seek to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty by offering distinctive, high-quality products on a timely and cost-attractive basis and by offering efficient customer service. We regard the features, quality, and performance of our products as the most important components of our customer satisfaction and loyalty efforts, but we also rely on customer service and support.

Furthermore, we intend to continue improving our business operations, including research and development, component sourcing, production processes, marketing programs, and customer support. Thus, we are continuing our efforts to enhance our production by increasing daily production quantities through equipment acquisitions, expanded shifts and process improvements, increased operational availability of our equipment, reduced equipment down times, and increased overall efficiency.
 
We believe that by enhancing our brand recognition, our market share might grow correspondingly. Industry sources estimate that 70 million to 80 million people in the United States own an aggregate of more than 400 million firearms, creating a large potential market for our safes and personal security products. We are focusing on the premium segment of the market through the quality, distinctiveness, and performance of our products; the effectiveness of our marketing and merchandising efforts; and the attractiveness of our competitive pricing strategies.
 
Targeted  Strategic Corporate Reorganization for Long-term Growth
 
We are consistently evaluating and considering acquisitions opportunities, such as the acquisition LOI described above, that fit our overall growth strategy as part of our overall mission to accelerate long-term value for our stockholders and create integrated value chains.
Expanding Scope of Operations Activities Servicing Dispensaries and Brand Licensing
 
We continually seek to target new consumer segments for our safes. As we believe that safes are becoming a must-have household appliance, we strive to establish authenticity by selling our products to additional groups, and to expand our direct-to-consumer presence through our website and our showroom in Lenexa, Kansas.
 
Further, we expect the cannabis dispensary industry to be a material growth segment for our business. Several cannabis dispensary operators have expressed interest in the opportunity to help them with their inventory locking needs. Cannabis dispensaries have various insurance requirements and local ordinances requiring them to secure their inventory when the dispensary is closed. Dispensary operators have been purchasing gun safes and independently taking out the inside themselves to allow them to store cannabis inventory. Recognizing what seems to be a growing need for cannabis dispensary operators, we have designed a safe tailor-made for the cannabis industry. With the legal cannabis hyper-growth market expected to exceed $43 billion by 2025, and an increasing number of states where the growth and cultivation of cannabis is legal (California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington), we believe we are well positioned to address the need of dispensaries. American Rebel has a long list of dispensary operators, growers, and processors interested in the Company’s inventory control solutions. We believe that dispensary operators, growers, and processors are another fertile new growth market for our Vault Doors products, as many in the cannabis space have chosen to install entire vault rooms instead of individual inventory control safes—the American Rebel Vault Door has been the choice for that purpose.
 
Further, we believe that American Rebel has significant potential for branded products as a lifestyle brand. As the American Rebel Brand continues to grow in popularity, we anticipate to generate additional revenue from licensing fees earned from third parties who wish to engage the American Rebel community. While the Company does not generate material revenues from licensing fees, our management believes the American Rebel brand name may in the future have significant licensing value to third parties that seek the American Rebel name to brand their products to market to the American Rebel target demographic. For example, a tool manufacturer that wants to pursue an alternative marketing plan for a different look and feel could license the American Rebel brand name for their line of tools and market their tools under our distinct brand. This licensee would benefit from the strong American Rebel brand with their second line of American Rebel branded tools as they would continue to sell both the line of tools under their brand and the line under the American Rebel brand. Conversely, American Rebel could potentially also benefit as a licensee of products. If American Rebel determines a third party has designed, engineered, and manufactured a product that would be a strong addition to the American Rebel catalog of products, American Rebel could license that product from the third-party and sell the licensed product under the American Rebel brand.

Competition
 
The North American safe industry is dominated by a small number of companies. We compete primarily on the quality, safety, reliability, features, performance, brand awareness, and price of our products. Our primary competitors include companies such as Liberty Safe, Fort Knox Security Products, American Security, Sturdy Safe Company, Homeland Security Safes, SentrySafe and Champion Safe (who is also our OEM manufacturer) as well as certain other domestic manufacturers, as well as certain China-based manufactured safes. Safes manufactured in China, including Steelwater and Alpha-Guardian, have struggled under the import tariffs initiated under the administration of former U.S President Donald Trump and continued by the current administration. We believe that given the current substantial uncertainty related to the supply chain and delivery of international goods, we have a competitive advantage because our safes are not manufactured overseas.
Intellectual Property
 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our brand and technology, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property or proprietary rights of third parties and prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of United States registered, pending and common law trademarks to protect our brand “American Rebel”.
 
On May 29, 2018, US Patent No. 9,984,552, Firearm Detecting Luggage, was issued to us. The term of the patent is 20 years from the issuance date. In addition to our patent, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological development and maintain our competitive position. Trade secrets and know-how, however, can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees and independent contractors.
 
Regulation
 
The storage of firearms and ammunition is subject to increasing federal, state and local governmental laws. While the current legislative climate does not appear to seek to limit possession of firearms, there is apparent momentum to require safe storage of firearms and ammunition. Although our safes, which are the primary driver of our sales and revenues, are designed to protect any valuables, a significant number of our safes’ end users have traditionally been gun enthusiasts, collectors, hunters, sportsmen and competitive shooters. Therefore, we expect the increasing federal, state and local governmental regulation of gun storage to have a materially positive effect on our business.
Our Customers
 
We primarily market and sell our products to safe-only specialty stores and independent gun stores nationwide. We also sell our products online to individuals desiring home, personal and office protection, as well as to recreational shooters and hunters. Our customers choose us for a number of reasons, including the breadth and availability of the products we offer, our extensive expertise, and the quality of our customer service.
 
We believe the nature of our solutions and our high-touch customer service model strengthens relationships, builds loyalty and drives repeat business as our customers’ businesses expand. In addition, we feel as if our premium product lines and comprehensive product portfolio position us well to meet our customers’ needs. Furthermore, we fully anticipate that we will be able to leverage all of the data that we are collecting from our existing customer base to make continuous improvements to our offerings and better serve our current and new customers in the future.
 
We intend to expand our distribution to sporting goods stores, farm and home stores, other independent retailers as well as our online customer base upon securing additional funding and setting up our first manufacturing facility.

Suppliers
 
We are dependent on the continued supply and manufacturing of our safes, backpacks and apparel at third-party facilities locations, which are critical to our success. Any event that causes a disruption of the operation of these facilities for even a relatively short period of time would adversely affect our ability to ship and deliver our safes and other products and to provide service to our customers. We have previously experienced, including during the first months after the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may in the future experience, launch and production ramp up delays for our products as a result of disruption at our suppliers manufacturing partners. Additionally, we have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of our branded safes from our suppliers could limit our sales. In the long term, we intend to supplement safes manufactured by our suppliers with safes manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient and result in a greater manufacturing volume and under our control. Our efforts to develop and manufacture such safes, however, have required and may require significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned safes or procure additional safes from different suppliers at potentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.
 
Furthermore, the cost of safes, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw manufacturing materials such as steel, locks, fireboard, hinges, pins and other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials, including as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products. Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to these parts and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased safe prices. Moreover, any such attempts to increase product prices may harm our brand, prospects and operating results.
 
We currently rely on third-party suppliers to ship our products to our customers. We have found that dedicated truckloads from our warehouse to our dealers reduce freight damage and provide the overall best shipping solution. Several companies offer dedicated truckload shipping. Increased sales will offer the opportunity to establish regional distribution centers.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We market our products to consumers through independent safe specialty stores, select national and regional retailers, local specialty firearms stores, as well as via e-commerce. We maintain consumer-focused product marketing and promotional campaigns, which include print and digital advertising campaigns; social and electronic media; product demonstrations; point-of-sales materials; in-store training; and in-store retail merchandising. Our use of social media includes Facebook, and YouTube.
Marketing Team Aligned with Sales Force to Maximize Our Industry Visibility to Drive Revenue
 
Our Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. Ross, is familiar to many in the industry due to his twelve years on television as the host of Maximum Archery and later American Rebel, that was broadcast on The Outdoor Channel, Sportsman Channel and the Pursuit Channel. Our Marketing and Sales teams have established American Rebel as a brand that our customers want and a brand that they are proud to embrace and bring into their homes.
Direct Marketing
 
In light of the expertise required to deliver and install safes that weigh 500-1000 pounds, direct marketing is utilized to create awareness and provide information. Our website, AmericanRebel.com, has proven to be a very valuable tool in introducing potential customers to our products. Infomercials and direct-to-consumer campaigns are vehicles to expand our reach at the appropriate time. Currently the demand from our current customers and future customer pool of independent safe specialty stores is high. As the Company grows and seeks out new customers to expand its customer base, direct marketing will be an asset for American Rebel. Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. Ross, was basically making infomercials to promote his Ross Archery products when he was filming Maximum Archery during the mid-2000s.

Social Media and Thought Leadership
 
A portion of marketing dollars will be directed to social media. American Rebel and Chief Executive Officer Charles A. Ross have large followings on social media and a dedicated social media campaign will efficiently reach large numbers of potential customers and brand adopters. We will leverage our social media assets to cross-promote locally with independent safe specialty store customers to pull out product through the sales channel. Driving demand and awareness of our products to our customers will expand their loyalty to American Rebel and increase each stores’ commitment to our brand.
Trade Shows
 
Trade shows have been an important medium to introducing our brand and our products. The NRA Annual Meeting, a consumer trade show, is a valuable opportunity to meet and greet our final customers. When we launched our Concealed Carry line of products at the NRA Annual Meeting in Atlanta, GA, in the Spring of 2017, the response from the meeting attendees was overwhelming. We immediately knew the product line resonated with consumers. Similarly, when we introduced our line of safes at the 2019 NRA Annual Meeting in the Spring of 2019, we knew we were on to something significant. The USCCA (United States Concealed Carry Association) has an annual Concealed Carry and Home Defense Expo. This is also an excellent opportunity to meet, greet and sell product to our final customers, the buying public. The Iowa Deer Classic and Illinois Deer Classic are carryovers from our Chief Executive Officer Charles A. Ross’ hosting duties on Maximum Archery, but we have found that many potential safe buyers attend these shows.
 
Two industry-only trade shows we attend are the SHOT Show and Nation’s Best Sports (NBS) Spring and Fall Buying Markets. The SHOT Show is very high profile show that most movers and shakers in the firearms industry attend. Operated by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the SHOT Show is the first trade show of the calendar year and is a great opportunity to introduce the year’s new products. NBS operates buying group shows where retailers who are members of NBS attend the Spring and Fall Market Buying shows to place orders. NBS provides an excellent base of customers for us to introduce our products to.
 
Paid Advertising
 
We will occasionally purchase paid print advertising to support editorial and events. The American Shooting Journal has been very supportive of our business has featured an interview with our Chief Executive Officer in one of past issues of the magazine.
 
Effects of COVID-19
 
Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and Related Market Impact. The COVID-19 outbreak has presented evolving risks and developments domestically and internationally, as well as new opportunities for our business. Although the pandemic has not materially impacted our results and operations adversely, our ability to satisfy demand for our products could be negatively impacted by mandatory forced production disruptions of our safes’ sole third-party manufacturer and strategic partners. Any significant disruption to communications and travel, including travel restrictions and other potential protective quarantine measures against COVID-19 by governmental agencies, could make it difficult for us to deliver goods and services to our customers. Further, travel restrictions and protective measures against COVID-19 could cause the Company to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain the Company’s ability to retain the highly skilled personnel the Company needs for its operations. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business, sales and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be currently predicted.
 
Additionally, as a result of COVID-19, at any time we may be subject to increased operating costs, supply interruptions, and difficulties in obtaining raw materials and components. To address these challenges, we continue to monitor our supply chain. We have recently entered into a contract with a third-party manufacturer to exclusively assemble our upcoming additional new line of safes. We believe that this vertical integration would allow us, among other benefits, to ramp up our production levels to meet expected demand for our products, provide us greater autonomy over the manufacturing process, and add what we believe are distinctive features to our safes.
 
We expect that the demand for home, office and personal safety and security products would remain stable, in part due to customers spending more time working remotely, increasing regulation mandating safe storage, and substantial uncertainty related to the supply chain and delivery of international goods, which in turn translate into, we believe, growth in demand for our home and personal safes as a U.S. company. We, however, cannot guarantee, that demand for our safes and personal security products will keep growing through the end of the 2022 calendar year and beyond.

Further, due to the effects of COVID-19, our management have reduced unnecessary marketing expenditures as part of continued efforts to adjust the Company’s operations to address changes in the safes and vault industry, and particularly to improve staff and human capital expenditures, while maintaining overall workforce levels.
 
Due to the substantial uncertainty related to the effects of the pandemic, its duration and the related market impacts, including the economic stimulus activity, we are unable to predict the specific impact the pandemic and related restrictions (including the lifting or re-imposing of restrictions due to any current or future variants of the COVID-19 virus or otherwise) will have on our results of operations, liquidity or long-term financial results.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
There are no proceedings to which any director or officer, or any associate of any such director or officer, is a party that is adverse to our Company or any of our subsidiaries or has a material interest adverse to our Company or any of our subsidiaries. No director or executive officer has been a director or executive officer of any business which has filed a bankruptcy petition or had a bankruptcy petition filed against it during the past ten years. No current director or executive officer has been convicted of a criminal offense or is the subject of a pending criminal proceeding during the past ten years. No current director or executive officer has been the subject of any order, judgment or decree of any court permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities during the past ten years. No current director or officer has been found by a court to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law during the past ten years.
 
From time to time, however, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
