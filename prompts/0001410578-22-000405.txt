Item 1.    Business
Acquisition of VCN Biosciences, S.L
On December 14, 2021, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) with VCN Biosciences, S.L., a corporation organized under the laws of Spain (“VCN”) and the shareholders of VCN (the “Sellers”), which provided for our acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of all the outstanding shares of VCN (the “VCN Shares”) from the shareholders of VCN. VCN is a private, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing new oncolytic adenoviruses for the treatment of cancer. VCN’s lead product candidate, VCN-01, is being studied in clinical trials for pancreatic cancer and retinoblastoma. The Acquisition was consummated on March 10 2022 and VCN became our wholly owned subsidiary. 
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, as consideration for the purchase of the VCN Shares of capital stock, we paid $4,700,000 (the “Closing Cash Consideration”) to Grifols Innovation and New Technologies Limited (“Grifols”), the owner of approximately 86% of the equity of VCN, and issued to the remaining Sellers 26,395,303 shares of our common stock, $.001 par value (the “Closing Shares”), representing 19.99% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on December 14, 2021, the date of the Purchase Agreement.

​
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, at the Closing we assumed $2,400,000 of liabilities of VCN, which includes certain loans from the Spanish Government and the Catalan Government Agency.
The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Sellers and us. Subject to certain customary limitations, the Sellers have agreed to indemnify us and our officers and directors against certain losses related to, among other things, breaches of their representations and warranties, certain specified liabilities and the failure to perform covenants or obligations under the Purchase Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement we agreed to loan VCN up to $425,000 to help finance the costs of certain of VCN’s research and development activities. In addition, at Closing VCN and Grifols entered into a sublease agreement for the sublease by VCN of the laboratory and office space currently occupied by it as well as a transitional services agreement. We agreed as a post- Closing covenant to commit to fund VCN’s research and development programs, including but not limited to VCN-01 PDAC phase 2 trial, VCN-01 RB pivotal trial and necessary G&A within a budgetary plan of approximately $27.8 million.
Overview
Upon effecting the Acquisition, on March 10, 2022 our pipeline is now expanded to include and focus on treatments of cancers. Our product pipeline has been expanded to include VCN’s lead product candidate, VCN-01, which is being studied in clinical trials for pancreatic cancer and retinoblastoma. In February 2022, VCN-01 received Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of retinoblastoma from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”). VCN-01 is designed to be administered systemically, intratumorally or intravitreally, either as a monotherapy or in combination with standard of care, to treat a wide variety of cancer indications. VCN-01 is designed to replicate selectively and aggressively within tumor cells, and to degrade the tumor stroma barrier that serves as a significant physical and immunosuppressive barrier to cancer treatment, Degrading the tumor stroma has been shown to improve access to the tumor by the virus and additional therapies such as chemo- and immuno-therapies. Importantly, degrading the stroma exposes tumor antigens, turning “cold” tumors “hot” and enabling a sustained anti-tumor immune response. VCN has the rights to four exclusive patents for proprietary technologies, as well as technologies developed in collaboration with the Virotherapy Group of the Catalan Institute of Oncology (“ICO-IDIBELL”), with a number of additional patents pending.

Prior to the Acquisition, our main focus was on developing therapeutics designed to treat gastrointestinal (GI) diseases in areas of high unmet need. Our lead clinical development candidates in addition to our VCN product candidates are: (1) SYN-004 (ribaxamase) which is designed to degrade certain commonly used intravenous (IV) beta-lactam antibiotics within the GI tract to prevent microbiome damage, Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), overgrowth of pathogenic organisms, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, and (2) SYN-020, a recombinant oral formulation of the enzyme intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) produced under cGMP conditions and intended to treat both local GI and systemic diseases. We intend to continue with our clinical development partners to advance the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in allogeneic HCT patients, and complete the Phase 1 program for SYN-020 intestinal IAP to support potential development in a number of significant clinical indications related to inflammation and gut barrier dysfunction. We have an option-license agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital (“MGH”) for intellectual property related to these SYN-020 indications.
During the first quarter of 2021, Washington University began enrollment and dosed our first patient in the first of three antibiotic cohorts for the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 in adult HCT recipients (Q2 2021). At December 31 2021, 12 participants had been treated with at least one dose of the study drug and 8 were considered evaluable towards the primary endpoint.
During the second quarter of 2021, we commenced and completed enrollment, dosing and observation in a Phase 1 single ascending dose (“SAD”) study of SYN-020 in healthy volunteers. Analyses of preliminary data from the Phase 1 SAD study of SYN-020 demonstrated that SYN-020 maintained a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated at all doses with no treatment related adverse events and no serious adverse events reported. During the third quarter of 2021, we commenced enrollment, dosing and observation in a Phase 1, multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) clinical trial of SYN-020 in healthy, adult volunteers. A data readout is anticipated during the second quarter of 2022.

Our Current Gastrointestinal (GI) and Microbiome-Focused Pipeline
Our SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and SYN-020 clinical programs are focused on the gastrointestinal tract (GI) and the gut microbiome, which is home to billions of microbial species and composed of a natural balance of both “good” beneficial species and potentially “bad” pathogenic species. When the natural balance or normal function of these microbial species is disrupted, a person’s health can be compromised. Disruption of the gut barrier is associated with a number of inflammatory and metabolic diseases. All of our programs are supported by our growing intellectual property portfolio. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio through filing new patent applications; prosecuting existing applications; and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications.
SYN-004 (ribaxamase) — Prevention of antibiotic-mediated microbiome damage, C. difficile infections (CDI), overgrowth of pathogenic organisms, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in allogeneic HCT recipients
SYN-004 (ribaxamase) is a proprietary oral capsule prophylactic therapy designed to degrade certain IV beta-lactam antibiotics excreted into the GI tract and thereby maintain the natural balance of the gut microbiome. Preventing beta-lactam damage to the gut microbiome has a range of potential therapeutic outcomes, including prevention of CDI, suppression of the overgrowth of pathogenic species (particularly antimicrobial-resistant organisms) and potentially reducing the incidence and/or severity of aGVHD in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients. SYN-004 (ribaxamase) 75 mg capsules are intended to be administered orally while patients are administered certain IV beta-lactam antibiotics. The capsule dosage form is designed to release the SYN-004 (ribaxamase) enzyme into proximal small intestine, where it has been shown to degrade beta-lactam antibiotics in the GI tract without altering systemic antibiotic levels. Beta-lactam antibiotics are a mainstay in hospital infection management and include the commonly used penicillin and cephalosporin classes of antibiotics.
Clostridioides difficile Infection
Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile and often called C. difficile or CDI) is a leading type of hospital acquired infection and is frequently associated with IV beta-lactam antibiotic treatment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified C. difficile as an “urgent public health threat,” particularly given its resistance to many drugs used to treat other infections. CDI is a major unintended risk associated with the prophylactic or therapeutic use of IV antibiotics, which may adversely alter the natural balance of microflora that normally protect the GI tract, leading to C. difficile overgrowth and infection. Other risk factors for CDI include hospitalization, prolonged length of stay (estimated at 7 days), underlying illness, and immune-compromising conditions including the administration of chemotherapy and advanced age. According to a paper published in BMC Infectious Diseases (Desai K et al. BMC Infect Dis. 2016; 16: 303) the economic cost of CDI was approximately $5.4 billion in 2016 ($4.7 billion in healthcare settings; $725 million in the community) in the U.S., mostly due to hospitalizations.
Limitations of Current Treatments and Market Opportunity
CDI is a widespread and often drug resistant infectious disease. Approximately 20% of patients who have been diagnosed with CDI experience a recurrence of CDI within one to three months. Furthermore, controlling the spread of CDI has proven challenging, as the C. difficile spores are easily transferred to patients via normal contact with healthcare personnel and with inanimate objects. There is currently no vaccine or approved product for the prevention of primary (incident) CDI. The current standard of care for primary CDI, as outlined by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), is to treat with powerful antibiotics such as fidaxomicin or vancomycin. Prolonged use of fidaxomicin and vancomycin has been shown to further exacerbate damage to the gut microbiome, leading to increased risk of CDI recurrence as well as the emergence of pathogenic and antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) organisms, such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). AMR is a serious global threat and one which world leaders have begun to take action against. According to the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infections Disease (ECCMID), failure to address AMR could lead to a potential antibiotic Armageddon, resulting in 10 million deaths worldwide by 2050 and may cost as much as $100 trillion in worldwide economic output.
According to a paper published in BMC Infectious Diseases (Desai K (2016) Epidemiological and economic burden of Clostridium difficile in the United States: estimates from a modeling approach. BMC Infect Dis 16: 303), it is estimated that approximately 606,000 patients are infected with C. difficile annually in the U.S., and it has been reported that approximately 44,500 deaths are attributable to CDI-associated complications each year. According to IMS Health Incorporated*, in 2016, the potential addressable market for SYN-004 (ribaxamase) included approximately 227 million doses of intravenous Penicillin and Cephalosporin antibiotics which were administered in the United States and which may contribute to the onset of CDI. Additional data derived from IMS Health Incorporated states that in 2016, the worldwide market for SYN-004 (ribaxamase)-addressable intravenous beta-lactam antibiotics was approximately 

8



7.5 billion doses, which may represent a multi-billion-dollar market opportunity for us. If approved, SYN-004 (ribaxamase) would be the first therapeutic intervention indicated to prevent the onset of antibiotic-mediated primary CDI.
Phase 1a and 1b Clinical Trial Pharmacokinetic Data
In March 2015, we reported supportive pharmacokinetic data from a Phase 1a clinical trial, which suggested that SYN-004 (ribaxamase) should have no effect on the IV antibiotic in the bloodstream, allowing the antibiotic to fight the primary infection. In February 2015, we reported supportive topline results from a subsequent Phase 1b clinical trial of escalating doses of oral SYN-004 (ribaxamase), with no safety or tolerability issues reported at dose levels and dosing regimens that were equivalent to or exceeded those expected to be studied in subsequent clinical trials. The Phase 1a (40 participants) and 1b (24 participants) clinical trials of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) were initiated in December 2014.
Two Phase 2a Clinical Trials: Topline Results
In December 2015, we reported supportive topline results from our first Phase 2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase). The study demonstrated that SYN-004 (ribaxamase) successfully degraded IV ceftriaxone in the chyme of ten participants with ileostomies without affecting the levels of ceftriaxone in the bloodstream. In May 2016, we reported supportive topline results from a second Phase 2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in 14 healthy participants with functioning ileostomies administered IV ceftriaxone with and without oral SYN-004 (ribaxamase). This second study demonstrated that the 150 mg dose of SYN-004 (ribaxamase), both alone and in the presence of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI), esomeprazole, degraded ceftriaxone excreted into the chyme resulting in ceftriaxone levels that were low or not-detectable. Ceftriaxone plasma concentrations in participants of the second study were not altered by SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in the presence or absence of an oral PPI, suggesting limited drug-drug interactions. The 150 mg dose of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) was well tolerated by all participants in this clinical trial.
Phase 2b Proof of Concept Clinical Trial Design & Results
In September 2015, we initiated a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical study in 412 patients (206 per group).
On January 5, 2017, we announced positive topline data from our Phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical trial intended to evaluate the ability of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) to prevent CDI, CDAD (C. difficile-associated diarrhea) and AAD (antibiotic-associated diarrhea) in patients hospitalized for a lower respiratory tract infection and receiving IV ceftriaxone. Results from this study demonstrated that SYN-004 (ribaxamase) achieved its primary endpoint of significantly reducing CDI. Preliminary analysis of the data indicated seven confirmed cases of CDI in the placebo group compared to two cases in the SYN-004 (ribaxamase) treatment group. Patients receiving SYN-004 (ribaxamase) achieved a 71.4% relative risk reduction (p-value=0.045) in CDI rates compared to patients receiving placebo. SYN-004 (ribaxamase) treated patients also demonstrated a significant reduction in new colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) compared to placebo (p-value=0.002). Results from this trial also demonstrated that patients administered ribaxamase in conjunction with IV-ceftriaxone demonstrated comparable cure rates (approximately 94%) for the treatment of primary infection compared to the placebo group. Results from this trial also demonstrated that the percentage of subjects reporting at least one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) was similar between SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and placebo treatment groups (40.8% vs 44.2%). Adverse events reported during this trial were comparable between treatment and placebo arms. Serious adverse events (SAEs) in the treatment arm, including fatal AEs, which exceeded those in the placebo arm, were not considered drug-related by investigators at the clinical sites, or by an independent third-party, each of whom determined SAEs were attributable to disparities in the underlying health and comorbidities between the groups.

On October 6, 2016 we were awarded a government contract in the amount of $521,014 by the CDC’s Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 2016-N-17812 to examine changes in the gut resistome of patients in our Phase 2b clinical study. Data generated under this contract are consistent with SYN-004’s (ribaxamase) mode of action of preserving the normal gut flora by degrading ceftriaxone in the upper GI tract of study participants treated with SYN-004 (ribaxamase). The data further demonstrated that SYN-004 (ribaxamase) significantly reduced the loss of microbial diversity, reduced overgrowth of opportunistically pathogenic species, and reduced the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes (such as VRE) caused by ceftriaxone treatment in SYN-004 (ribaxamase) treated patients compared to placebo.

Future Planning and Potential Regulatory Strategy for Prevention of Primary CDI
On November 21, 2018, we announced results from our End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA during which key elements of a Phase 3 clinical program were confirmed. Pursuant to the meeting, the FDA proposed criteria for Phase 3 clinical efficacy and safety which, if achieved, may support submission for marketing approval of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) on the basis of a single Phase 3 clinical trial. The proposed SYN-004 (ribaxamase) Phase 3 clinical program entails a single, global, event-driven clinical trial with a fixed maximum number of approximately 4,000 patients for total enrollment and evaluates the potential efficacy and safety of ribaxamase in a broad patient population by enrolling patients with a variety of underlying infections treated with a range of IV beta-lactam antibiotics.
The proposed Phase 3 clinical trial incorporates co-primary safety and efficacy endpoints (mortality and the reduction in the incidence of CDI at one month after the last drug dose in the SYN-004 (ribaxamase) treatment group versus placebo,respectively). We expect the clinical development costs to complete this trial to be in excess of $80 million and anticipate initiating the Phase 3 clinical program only after securing additional potential financing via a strategic partnership.
Acute Graft-Versus-Host-Disease in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (allogeneic HCT) Recipients & SYN-004 (ribaxamase)
In parallel with our clinical and regulatory efforts, we completed a Health Economics Outcomes Research (HEOR) study, which was conducted to generate key insights on how we can expect Health Care Practitioners, or HCPs, to evaluate patient access for SYN-004 (ribaxamase) while also providing a framework for potential reimbursement strategies. After evaluating findings from the study, we believe that there is significant potential value in exploring the development of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in a narrower patient population where the incidence of the disease endpoint is high and the clinical development may be less costly.
We believe allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, who have a very high risk of CDI, VRE colonization and potentially fatal bacteremia, and acute-graft-vs-host disease (aGVHD), represent such a patient population. Published literature has demonstrated a strong association between these adverse outcomes and microbiome damage caused by IV beta-lactam antibiotics in these patients. Approximately 80-90% of HCT recipients receive IV beta-lactam antibiotics to treat febrile neutropenia. Penicillins and cephalosporins are first-line therapies in the USA and EU, whereas carbapenems are first-line in China. Antibiotic-mediated damage to the gut microbiome is strongly associated with GVHD, bloodstream infections, VRE bacteremia, transplant relapse, and increased mortality in HCT recipients, raising concern over the spectrum of antibiotics used during HCT.
CDI occurs in up to 31% of HCT patients and is associated with GVHD and increased mortality. aGVHD occurs in 30-60% of allogeneic HCT recipients and is recognized as a primary contributor to morbidity and mortality in this patient population. In 2018, there were approximately 9,000 reported allogeneic HCT procedures in the USA, an estimated 19,800 procedures in Europe, 9,600 in China, and 3,500 in Japan. First-line treatments for aGVHD fail in more than 50% of patients and 2-year survival in patients with steroid refractory aGVHD is only 20%. At least one U.S. study found allogeneic HCT recipients who developed aGVHD had 3-times higher in-hospital mortality and almost 2-fold higher median hospital costs than patients who did not develop aGVHD. It has been reported that in-patient costs for allogeneic HCT in the USA range from $180,000-$300,000 depending on the disease severity. In 2014, all-cause costs for allogeneic HCT in the USA were greater than $600,000 per patient (up to 12 months post-transplant). VRE infection is a persistent problem in HCT patients and VRE colonization after HCT has been associated with decreased patient survival.
Phase 1b/2a Clinical Study in Allogeneic HCT Recipients
In August 2019, we entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) with the Washington University School of Medicine (Washington University) to conduct a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase). Under the terms of this agreement, we serve as the sponsor of the study and supply SYN-004 (ribaxamase). Dr. Erik R. Dubberke, Professor of Medicine and Clinical Director, Transplant Infectious Diseases at Washington University and a member of the SYN-004 (ribaxamase) steering committee serves as the principal investigator of the clinical trial in collaboration with his Washington University colleague Dr. Mark A. Schroeder, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation and Leukemia.
On January 7, 2020, we announced the receipt of official meeting minutes from the FDA following a Type-C meeting held on December 2, 2019 at our request to discuss the development of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) for treatment of allogeneic HCT recipients who are administered IV beta-lactam antibiotics in response to fever. Based on the final meeting minutes, the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial will comprise a single center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of oral SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in up to 36 evaluable adult allogeneic HCT recipients. The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and potential absorption into the systemic circulation (if any) of oral SYN-004 (ribaxamase; 150 mg four times daily) administered to allogeneic HCT recipients who receive an IV carbapenem or beta-lactam antibiotic to treat fever. Study participants will be enrolled into three sequential cohorts 

10



administered a different study-assigned IV antibiotic. Each cohort seeks to complete eight evaluable participants treated with SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and four evaluable participants treated with placebo. Safety and pharmacokinetic data for each cohort will be reviewed by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, which will make a recommendation on whether to proceed to the next IV antibiotic cohort. The study will also evaluate potential protective effects of SYN-004 on the gut microbiome as well as generate preliminary information on potential therapeutic benefits and patient outcomes of SYN-004 in allogeneic HCT recipients.
On July 30, 2020, we received written notification from the FDA informing us that they determined the Phase 1b/2a clinical program in adult allogeneic HCT recipients may proceed per the submitted clinical study protocol. On December 22, 2020, we announced that we received approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Washington University to commence the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004. During the first quarter of 2021, Washington University began screening patients for enrollment of the first of three antibiotic cohorts in the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 in allogeneic HCT recipients. On April 14, 2021, we announced that the first patient had been dosed in our Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients for the prevention of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD. To date, we have dosed 14 patients (10 that are considered evaluable) in the study. If enrollment proceeds as planned, we may be positioned to announce as many as three interim data readouts during the next 12-18 months with the first one anticipated from the first antibiotic cohort towards the end of Q2 2022, pandemic conditions permitting, the second cohort during the first half of 2023 and the third cohort during the first half of 2024.
Due to the unique challenges posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic, Washington University had previously halted the commencement of the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial and they continue to evaluate non-essential activities which may have a direct impact on the continuation of the ongoing clinical trial. Continuation of the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial including, but not limited to, the enrollment of new patients remains largely at the discretion of Washington University and is contingent upon their ability to conduct this clinical program free from the impact of COVID-19. We remain in close contact with Washington University and are actively monitoring the potential impact of COVID-19 on the clinical development plans of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) program.
SYN-020 — Oral Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (IAP)
SYN 020 is a quality-controlled, recombinant version of bovine Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (IAP) produced under cGMP conditions and formulated for oral delivery. The published literature indicates that IAP functions to diminish GI and systemic inflammation, tighten the gut barrier to diminish “leaky gut,” and promote a healthy microbiome. Despite its broad therapeutic potential, a key hurdle to commercialization has been the high cost of IAP manufacture which is commercially available for as much as $10,000 per gram. We believe we have developed technologies to traverse this hurdle and now have the ability to produce more than 3 grams per liter of SYN-020 for roughly a few hundred dollars per gram at commercial scale. Based on the known mechanisms as well as our own supporting animal model data, we intended to initially develop SYN-020 to mitigate the intestinal damage caused by radiation therapy that is routinely used to treat pelvic cancers. While we believe SYN-020 may play a pivotal role in addressing acute and long-term complications associated with radiation exposure to the GI tract, we have also begun planning for potential development of SYN-020 in large market indications with significant unmet medical needs. Such indications include celiac disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”), and indications to treat and prevent metabolic and inflammatory disorders associated with aging which are supported by our collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital (“MGH”). Across the six major markets, the total prevalent cases of celiac disease are expected to increase from 5.8 million cases in 2013 to an expected 8.1 million cases in 2023, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 4%. During the same period, prevalent cases in the U.S. are expected to increase from 2.8 million in 2013 to an expected 4.3 million in 2023, representing a significant market opportunity.
On June 30, 2020, we submitted an IND application to the FDA in support of an initial indication for the treatment of radiation enteropathy secondary to pelvic cancer therapy. On July 30, 2020, we announced that we received a study-may-proceed letter from the FDA to conduct a Phase 1a single-ascending-dose (“SAD”) study in healthy volunteers designed to evaluate SYN-020 for safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic parameters. On April 1, 2021, we announced that enrollment had commenced in the Phase 1 SAD clinical trial of SYN-020. On June 29, 2021, we announced that enrollment, patient dosing and observation had been completed in the Phase 1, open-label, SAD study of SYN-020. The SAD study enrolled 6 healthy adult volunteers into each of four cohorts with SYN-020 given orally as single doses ranging from 5 mg to 150 mg. Analyses of preliminary data demonstrated that SYN-020 maintained a favorable safety profile, was well tolerated at all dose levels, and no adverse events were attributed to the study drug. No serious adverse events were reported.
During the third quarter of 2021 we initiated a Phase 1 clinical study evaluating multiple ascending doses (“MAD”) of SYN-020. On October 21, 2021 we announced that patient enrollment, dosing and observation commenced in the Phase 1 MAD of SYN-020. The Phase 1, placebo-controlled MAD study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and biodistribution of SYN-020 upon repeated dosing and enrolled 8 healthy adult volunteers into each of four cohorts (32 total study participants) with SYN-020 given orally at doses 

11



ranging from 5 mg to 75 mg twice daily for fourteen days. A safety review was conducted at the end of each cohort to determine whether progression into the next higher dose cohort was permissible. At this time, participant dosing and follow-up has been completed in all four cohorts and serum and fecal samples have been submitted for analysis of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (biomarker) endpoints. The study remains blinded; however, only sporadic mild adverse events were observed and there were no serious adverse events. A topline data readout of the Phase 1 MAD clinical study is anticipated during the second quarter of 2022. Both studies are intended to support the development of SYN-020 in multiple potential clinical indications including celiac disease, NAFLD, radiation enteritis, as well as indications supported by our collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital. We anticipate commencement of at least one Phase 2 clinical trial in an indication to be announced during H2 2022. 
During the second quarter of 2020, we announced that we entered into an agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital ('MGH”) granting us an option for an exclusive license to intellectual property and technology related to the use of IAP to maintain GI and microbiome health, diminish systemic inflammation, and treat age-related diseases. During the second quarter of 2021, we announced an amendment to our option for an exclusive license agreement with MGH to include intellectual property and technology related to the use of SYN-020 to inhibit liver fibrosis in select diseases, including NAFLD. Research published by a team of investigators led by Richard Hodin, MD, Chief of the Massachusetts General Hospital Division of General and Gastrointestinal Surgery and Professor of Surgery, Harvard Medical School, evaluated long-term oral supplementation of IAP, including SYN-020, in mice. Dr. Hodin’s research demonstrated that IAP administration, starting at 10 months of age, slowed the microbiome changes, gut-barrier dysfunction, and gastrointestinal and systemic inflammation that normally accompany aging. Additionally, the IAP administration resulted in improved metabolic profiles in the aged mice, diminished frailty, and extended lifespan. Under the terms of the agreement, we are granted exclusive rights to negotiate a worldwide license with MGH to commercially develop SYN-020 to treat and prevent metabolic and inflammatory diseases associated with aging. If executed, we plan to use this license in the advancement of an expanded clinical development program for SYN-020.
Our Current Oncology-Focused Pipeline (through the acquisition of VCN)
Oncolytic Viruses
Our oncology platform is based on oncolytic virotherapy (“OV therapy”), which exploits the ability of certain viruses to kill tumor cells and trigger an anti-tumor immune response. This novel class of targeted anticancer agents has unique mechanisms of action compared to other cancer drugs. Oncolytic viruses exploit the fact that cancer cells contain mutations that cause them to lose growth control and form tumors. Once inside a tumor cell, oncolytic viruses exploit the tumor cell machinery to generate thousands of additional copies of the virus, which then kill the tumor cell and spread to neighboring cells, causing a chain reaction of cell killing. This infection by OVs also alerts the immune system, which can then attack the virus infected cells and the tumor cells to help destroy the tumor in some instances.
Our OV products are engineered to efficiently infect and selectively replicate to a high extent in tumor cells versus normal host cells, which enables intravenous delivery. By contrast, many other oncolytic viruses in clinical development today are administered by direct injection into the tumor. Intravenous delivery has the potential to expand the therapeutic effect of OVs because the virus can infect both the primary tumor and tumor metastases throughout the body.
Our first product, VCN-01, is a clinical stage oncolytic human adenovirus (common cold virus) that is modified to express an enzyme, hyaluronidase, that helps the virus and other molecules to penetrate the tumor. VCN-01 can be used alone or in combination with other cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy, for difficult to treat cancers. An expanding intellectual property portfolio supports our oncology programs, and because our products are characterized as biologics, they will be further protected by data and/or market exclusivity in major markets.
VCN-01 — An oncolytic human type-5 virus engineered for intravenous administration and to express a tumor matrix degrading enzyme (PH20, hyaluronidase) that facilitates the entry of therapeutics and immune cells into tumors
VCN-01 is a genetically modified oncolytic adenovirus that has been engineered to contain four independent genetic modifications on the backbone of the wild-type human adenovirus serotype 5 (HAd5) genome. These modifications have been shown in preclinical and clinical studies to confer tumor selective replication and antitumor activity. VCN-01 was engineered to replicate in and kill virtually all cancer cells, to expose tumor neoantigens of lysed tumors, to increase tumor targeting, and to express PH20 hyaluronidase to enhance the penetration of virus, chemotherapy and immune cells into the tumor.

Malignant tumors are made up of tumor cells as well as significant supporting tissue known as tumor stroma. The tumor stroma supports the formation and growth of tumors and contains cells and other components that are required for robust tumor growth and metastasis. The stroma also forms an effective barrier to the entry of therapeutic agents such as chemotherapy and antibodies. VCN-01 is designed to overcome the stroma barrier problem by expressing the well-characterized stroma degrading enzyme PH20 hyaluronidase after it infects tumor cells. Expression of PH20 by VCN-01 degrades the hyaluronic acid within the tumor stroma and improves virus spread. Based upon the foregoing, we believe our oncolytic virus platform, exemplified by VCN-01, represents a new and potentially powerful form of therapy that combines tumor cell killing, anti-tumor immunity and stroma destruction after intravenous delivery.
The VCN-01 product candidate is provided as a sterile liquid concentrate that is diluted for infusion or injection. The proposed therapeutic indication for VCN-01 is the treatment of solid tumors, as its selectivity mechanism relies on cellular properties shared by virtually all human tumor cells. Our initial indication for clinical development is unresectable metastatic pancreatic cancer, a disease for which there is currently no cure and only limited therapeutic options.
VCN-01 has been evaluated in 72 patients across four Phase 1 clinical trials, including patients with pancreatic cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and retinoblastoma.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
Cancer of the pancreas consists of two main histological types: cancer that arises from the ductal (exocrine) cells of the pancreas or, much less often, cancers may arise from the endocrine compartment of the pancreas. Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (“PDAC”) accounts for more than 90% of all pancreatic tumors. It can be located either in the head of the gland or in the body-tail. Pancreatic cancer usually gives metastases to liver and peritoneum. Other less common sites are lungs, brain, kidney and bone. Since in early stages the pancreatic cancer does not give any characteristic symptoms, patients visit their physician late. Progressive abdominal pain many times is the first symptom. On the other hand, neither truly effective conventional radiological tests that may identify the early disease, nor specific and sensitive diagnostic serum markers are available. Therefore, it is very common that the pancreatic cancer is diagnosed in its late stages (locally advanced non-metastatic or metastatic stage of the disease) when the radical resection and possibly curative treatment is not possible anymore. It’s generally assumed that only 10% of cases are resectable at presentation, whereas 30-40% of patients are diagnosed at local advanced/unresectable stage and 50-60% presents distant metastases.
PDAC Clinical Unmet need and Market Opportunity
PDAC is one of the most fatal cancers accounting for the 3rd highest cause of cancer-associated deaths in US and 4th in the European Union. Despite significant research efforts, minimal progress has been achieved to date. The five-year overall survival rate is < 10% and has not substantially improved over the last 30 years. Surgery is the only treatment that offers the prospect of long term-survival; however, the 5-year survival for the limited number of patients in whom resection is possible remains low (20 – 30 %). Patients with advanced disease are managed with chemotherapy. In recent years, the combination of gemcitabine with albumin-bound paclitaxel (GA), and the combination of folic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) have emerged as the standard of care. However, the results are still very poor and new therapeutic interventions are needed. The increase is particularly evident in younger people and several studies anticipate that pancreatic cancer is expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States by 2030. The rising incidence of pancreatic cancer and its current economic burden place increased pressure to improve outcomes for patients.
In May 2011, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”) from the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) recommended granting Orphan Medicinal Product Designation to VCN-01 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and in June 2011, the European Commission confirmed the designation under Regulation (“EC”) No 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
Phase 1a/Proof of Concept Trial of VCN-01 by intratumor administration in PDAC
In September 2019, VCN presented a poster at the European Society for Molecular Oncology (“ESMO”) annual meeting describing initial mechanism of action data from a multicenter, Phase 1 dose escalation study of intratumoral (“IT”) VCN-01 administered to pancreatic cancer patients in combination with standard doses/schedules of either gemcitabine or nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (“NCT02045589”). The study was conducted at three hospitals in Spain and 8 patients with confirmed histologic diagnosis of unresectable PDAC amenable to endoscopic ultrasound guided (“EUS)) injection were treated with 3 injections (coincident with 1st day of the chemotherapy cycles) at two different dose levels of VCN-01 (six patients had metastatic disease and two had locally advanced disease). The treatment regimen was generally well-tolerated; however, one patient died from severe intraabdominal fluid collection that was considered to be related to VCN-01 treatment Evaluation of virus pharmacokinetics and PH20 levels in serum were consistent 

13



with strong virus replication in the tumors. This was supported by the presence of viral particles in tumor cells as assessed in paired tumor biopsies collected before and after treatment. Tumor stiffness was reduced in all VCN-01-injected lesions as measured by elastography. Disease stabilization of injected lesions was observed in 5 out of 6 patients although subsequent tumor progression was observed in most of the patients because of the appearance of new lesions or growth of distant, non-injected, metastatic lesions. This study provided encouraging mechanism of action data for VCN-01; however, intratumoral injection did not appear to deliver sufficiently high VCN-01 levels for effective delivery to non-injected tumors. We believe these results supported the evaluation of the safety/tolerability and potential efficacy of VCN-01 via intravenous administration in combination with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapies for the treatment of advanced PDAC.
Phase 1 Trial of intravenous VCN-01 with or without nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in patients with solid tumors and PDAC
In September 2019, we also presented a poster at the ESMO meeting describing initial data from a Phase I clinical trial whose aim was to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II dose (“RP2D”) and identify dose-limiting toxicity(ies) (“DLT”) for intravenous VCN-01 administered to patients with advanced cancer (“NCT02045602”). This study was designed as a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation phase I clinical trial of a single dose of intravenous VCN-01 alone (Part I, 16 patients with advanced refractory solid tumors) or in combination with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (Part II and III; patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma). In Part II, 12 patients received VCN-01 dose concurrent with chemotherapy on day 1, whereas in Part III 14 additional patients received the dose of VCN-01seven days before chemotherapy. The RP2D was determined to be 1x1013 viral particles (vp)/patient in Part I, 3.3x1012 vp/patient in Part II and 1x1013 vp/patient in Part III. Based on its apparent safety profile and the absence of dose-limiting toxicities, 1x1013 vp/patient using sequential dosing schedule was selected for further clinical development.
Pharmacokinetic data showed dose linearity, as well as relevant VCN-01 exposure. Analysis of VCN-01 clearance in patients enrolled in Part II did not show significant differences with respect to patients receiving VCN-01 as a single agent. VCN-01 viral genomes were detected in tumor tissue in 5 out of 6 biopsies. A second viral peak in plasma and increased hyaluronidase serum levels suggested replication after intravenous injection in all patients. Increased levels of immune biomarkers (IFNγ, sLAG3, IL-6, IL-10) were found after VCN-01 administration. In patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the overall response rate (ORR) was 50% for Part II and 50% for Part III, as assessed by the investigators. Median progression free survival (PFS) for patients in Part III was 6.7 months, and median overall survival (OS) was 13.5 months. Eight patients (66.7%) survived more than 12 months. In addition, in April 2021, a subgroup analysis of patients at the RP2D (1.x1013 vp/patient followed by nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine one week later, n=6) was conducted and showed an ORR of 83%, with a median PFS of 6.3 months and median OS of 20.8 months. Some VCN-01 treated patients appeared to benefit from late-onset responses. This form of delayed anti-tumor activity is not common with chemotherapy but is frequently observed with immunotherapies. We believe an immune mechanism of action associated with the oncolytic activity of VCN-01 may be the underlying explanation. VCN-01 appeared to convert the typically immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of pancreatic adenocarcinomas into an enhanced inflammatory microenvironment (IDO, CD28, PD-1, CTL signature up-regulation, and collagen formation) after treatment.
Future Planning and Potential Regulatory Strategy for development of VCN-01 in PDAC
We are currently planning a Phase 2 clinical trial of systemically administered VCN-01 in PDAC patients and anticipate submission of the protocol to the FDA and EMA in Q2 2022. The proposed Phase 2 trial is expected to be an open-label, randomized study to test the efficacy of VCN-01 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic cancer. The study is expected to enroll 92 patients and be conducted at approximately 25 sites in the US and EU. Two doses of VCN-01 are planned in the treatment arm: the 1st dose will be administered on day 1, then one week later 3 cycles of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as standard of care will be administered. The second VCN-01 dose will be administered after the third cycle of chemotherapy, followed by additional chemotherapy. Dr. Manuel Hidalgo, chief of the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology at Weill Cornell Medicine/New York-Presbyterian Hospital has been appointed as Principal Investigator. If the regulatory agencies allow us to proceed, initiation of recruitment is expected during Q4 2022.
Retinoblastoma
Retinoblastoma is a tumor that originates in the retina and it is the most common type of eye cancer in children. It occurs in approximately 1 / 14,000-1 / 18,000 live newborns and accounts for 15% of the tumors in the pediatric population < 1 year old. The average age of pediatric patients at diagnosis is 2, and it rarely occurs in children older than 6. In the US, retinoblastoma shows an incidence rate of 3.3 per 1,000,000 with only about 200 to 300 children diagnosed per year according to the American Cancer Society. Bilateral retinoblastoma (Rb1 germinal mutation) represents 25-35% of the cases while unilateral retinoblastoma (sporadic mutation) accounts for 65-75%. While retinoblastoma is a highly curable disease, with a current disease-free survival rate of >95%, the clinical challenge 

14



for those who treat retinoblastoma is to preserve life and to prevent the loss of an eye, blindness and other serious effects of treatment that reduce the patient’s life span or the quality of life.
Current treatments are not without significant morbidity, which may include visual impairment and severe cosmetic deformity secondary to enucleation and/or irradiation of the orbital region. The use of intravenous chemotherapy and more recently intra-arterial and intravitreal chemotherapy have resulted in a significantly greater number of eyes preserved with fewer long-term effects compared to past treatments such as external radiation therapy. However, allowing patients with advanced intraocular disease to be treated conservatively, led to the appearance of a subgroup of patients with advanced intraocular disease who relapsed after an initial response. Most of these cases include those patients who present gross vitreous or subretinal seeding. Once the aforementioned treatments are exhausted, these patients rarely manage to preserve the eyes and vision and must be enucleated. The ocular preservation rate of these eyes with advanced disease is still less than 50%.
In February 2022, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to VCN-01 for the treatment of retinoblastoma.
Phase 1 Trial of intravitreal VCN-01 in patients with retinoblastoma
During the third quarter of 2017, VCN entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement with Hospital Sant Joan de Déu (Barcelona, Spain) to conduct an investigator sponsored Phase 1 clinical study evaluating the safety and tolerability of two intravitreal injections of VCN-01 in patients with intraocular retinoblastoma refractory to systemic, intra-arterial or intravitreal chemotherapy, or radiotherapy, in whom enucleation was the only recommended treatment (NCT03284268). Patients received two doses of VCN-01 injected 14 days apart using a dose escalation regimen. At this time, the dose-escalation phase of the study has already been completed in 4 patients distributed in two cohorts (2 x 109 vp/eye and 2 x 1010 vp/eye). VCN-01 was well tolerated to date after intravitreal administration, although some degree of intravitreal inflammation and associated turbidity were observed. Inflammation has been managed and potential turbidity minimized with local and systemic administration of anti-inflammatory drugs. VCN-01 does not appear to change the retinal function, and selective VCN-01 replication in retinoblastoma cells has been observed by immunohistochemical analysis. Replication within retinoblastoma tumors over time was detected and VCN-01 reduced the number of vitreous seeds in all patients treated at 2 x 1010 vp/eye (n=3). The investigator has reported that one patient treated with VCN-01 has had a complete regression lasting more than 30 months.
This study is currently ongoing and anticipated to be completed in the second half of 2022.
VCN-01 in combination with Immunomodulatory therapeutics
Based on the clinical and pre-clinical data described below, we believe that the effect of administration of VCN-01, can elicit an anti-tumor immune response that could potentiate the effects of VCN-01 and co-administered therapeutics. Biopsies from the Phase 1 trial of PDAC patients administered intravenous VCN-01 demonstrated lymphocyte (CD8+) infiltration and modulated levels of immune markers in tumors, including an induction of the PD1/PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue from some of the patients. Preclinical experiments demonstrated that VCN-01 significantly increased extravasation of an anti-PD-L1 antibody into subcutaneous xenograft tumors compared to non-treated (PBS) tumors and also that PH20 hyaluronidase improves the ingress of T-cells in animal models. Thus, we hypothesize that the administration of VCN-01 into the tumor will help to overcome the observed resistance to PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors and to mesothelin-directed CAR-T cells.
Phase 1 Trial of intravenous VCN-01 in Combination with Durvalumab in Subjects with Recurrent/ Metastatic SCCHN
In February 2019, VCN entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement with Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO) (Spain) to conduct an investigator sponsored Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and RP2D of a single intravenous injection of VCN-01 combined with durvalumab in two administration regimens: VCN-01 concomitantly with durvalamab, or sequentially with durvalumab starting two weeks after VCN-01 administration (NCT03799744). The study is also designed to evaluate whether VCN-01 treatment can re-sensitize PD-(l)-1 refractory tumors to subsequent anti-PD-L1 therapy. Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa subclass that inhibits binding of PD-L1 and is being developed by AstraZeneca/MedImmune, which supplies the product for its use in the clinical study. This Phase I trial is a multicenter, open label, dose escalation study in patients with histologically confirmed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma from specific sites: oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx or hypopharynx that is recurrent/metastatic (R/M) and not amenable to curative therapy by surgery or radiation. In addition, all patients should have undergone prior exposure to anti-PD-(L) 1 and progressed. Patients are entered at each dose level, according to a planned dose escalation schedule. The treatment is a single intravenous VCN-01 dose combined with concomitant intravenous durvalumab (MEDI4736) 1500 mg Q4W (Arm I) or durvalumab starting two weeks after VCN-01 administration (“sequential schedule”; Arm II). Patient recruitment into Arm I and Arm II was performed concurrently. Only one single dose of VCN-01 is administered to each patient 

15



during the trial. Durvalumab is administered Q4W until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion. Patient recruitment into the study was completed in February 2022 with a total of 18 patients enrolled.
Phase 1 Trial evaluating the safety and feasibility of huCART-meso cells when given in combination with VCN-01
In July 2021, VCN entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement with the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia) to conduct an investigator sponsored Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and feasibility of intravenous administration of VCN-01 in combination with lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells (developed by the laboratory of Dr. Carl June) in patients with histologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and serous epithelial ovarian cancer (NCT05057715). This is a Phase I study evaluating the combination of VCN-01 when given in combination with lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells in a dose-escalation design in two cohorts (N = 3-6), where patients will receive VCN-01 as a single IV infusion (at 3.3x1012 or 1x1013 vp) on Day 0, followed by a single dose of 5x107 huCART-meso cells on Day 14 via IV infusion. huCART-meso cells are modified T-cells targeting the mesothelin antigen, which is frequently expressed in multiple tumor types, particularly in pancreatic and ovarian cancers. Dr. June’s previous clinical studies have shown that huCART-meso cells encounter significant challenges in the tumor microenvironment, including immunosuppressive cells and soluble factors as well as metabolic restrictions. Initial VCN-01 clinical data from the studies described above suggest that administration of VCN-01 may increase tumor immunogenicity and improve access of the huCART-meso cells to tumor cells. This Phase I study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the VCN-01 huCART-meso cell combination and test the hypothesis that administration of VCN-01 may enhance the potential antitumor effects of the co-administered huCART-meso cells . The trial is open but not yet recruiting.
Phase 1 Trial evaluating the intravenous administration of VCN-01 in patients prior to surgical resection of high-grade brain tumors
In the second quarter of 2021, VCN entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement with the University of Leeds (UK) to sponsor a proof of concept Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate whether intravenously administered VCN-01 can cross the blood-brain barrier and infect the target brain tumor. This is an open-label, non-randomized, single center study of VCN-01 given intravenously at a dose of 1x1013 virus particles to patients prior to planned surgery for recurrent high-grade primary or metastatic brain tumors. We believe that the intravenous delivery of anti-cancer therapy to brain tumors, if effective, may allow repeat dosing may enable the treatment of systemically disseminated brain metastases and may allow for reduction in the need to use neurosurgery to administer the drugs. This study aims to assess the presence of VCN-01 within the resected surgical specimen after systemic VCN-01 delivery and determine the safety of intravenous VCN-01 in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma or brain metastases. By confirming the presence of VCN-01 in high grade brain tumors following intravenous delivery, this study may pave the way for larger trials to study VCN-01 efficacy, both as a monotherapy and in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. This trial has already received approval from Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) from UK Government.
Research Programs
SYN-006; SYN-007 and SYN-005
To date, our research programs have been primarily directed to the development of GI acting products that have generated preclinical proof-of-concept with two pipeline products (SYN-006 and SYN-007) that expand the potential utility of our beta-lactamase strategy. SYN-007 is a specially formulated version of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) designed to degrade orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics to protect the gut microbiome from antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis. SYN-006 is a carbapenemase designed to degrade intravenous (IV) carbapenem antibiotics within the GI tract to maintain the natural balance of the gut microbiome for the prevention of CDI, overgrowth of pathogenic organisms and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Our SYN-005 monoclonal antibody program is intended to both treat and prevent pertussis. Our research programs may be expanded to include development of new oncolytic virus products and/or explore oncology applications of our existing products such as SYN-006 and SYN-020.

VCN-11 
VCN-11 is a novel virus that we believe has the potential to extend our OV platform. VCN-11 has been engineered to contain all of the features of VCN-01 as well as an additional modification to include an albumin binding domain (ABD) in the virus capsid. The virus capsid is the target for neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that are generated by the host immune system to destroy circulating viruses. The presence of an albumin binding domain, however, blocks the binding of most neutralizing antibodies, which allows the virus to reach the tumor following intravenous administration. This “albumin shield” works because human blood contains a large amount of albumin to coat the VCN-11 virus. Importantly, this coating of albumin appears to be displaced after the virus reaches tumor cells to infect them. In pre-clinical mouse studies to test the functionality of the “albumin shield”, mice pre-immunized with virus are able to completely neutralize an unmodified OV because they have a large concentration of neutralizing antibodies in their blood. By contrast, viruses containing the albumin binding domain such as VCN-11 are not neutralized and retain their ability to infect and destroy tumor cells. We believe these results support the further development of VCN-11 for tumors in which rapid multi-dosing may be beneficial.
In the second quarter of 2020, VCN had several interactions with Spanish regulatory authorities (AEMPS) to agree on the design of the non-clinical GLP toxicology and biodistribution studies that are required to support a first-in-human clinical trial for VCN-11.
In March 2021, preclinical data obtained with VCN-11 was published, showing that VCN-11 induced 450 times more cytotoxicity in tumor cells than in normal cells. VCN confirmed VCN-11 hyaluronidase production by measuring the activity of the PH20 enzyme with a hyaluronic acid-degradation assay, and by measuring PH20 activity in VCN-11 infected tumors in vivo. VCN-11 evaded NAbs from different sources and tumor targeting was demonstrated in the presence of high levels of NAbs in vivo, whereas the control virus without ABD was neutralized. VCN-11 showed a low toxicity profile in athymic nude mice and Syrian hamsters, allowing treatments with high doses and fractionated administrations without major toxicities (up to 1.2x1011vp/mouse and 7.5x1011vp/hamster). VCN-11 increased ALT levels on day 3 within an acceptable range that returned to normal levels by day 9. Fractionated intravenous administration of VCN-11 (splitting the dose into two portions administered 4 h apart) appeared to improve VCN-11 circulation kinetics and tumor targeting. VCN-11 showed antitumor efficacy in the presence of NAbs against Ad5 and itself.

Saint Joan De Déu Collaboration and License Agreement
On February 15, 2016, VCN entered into a Collaboration Agreement to Conduct a Clinical Trial and Grant an Operating License (the “Collaboration and License Agreement”) with the Saint Joan De Déu Hospital (the “Hospital”) and the Saint Joan De Déu Foundation (the “Foundation”, and together with the Hospital, the “Institution”) regarding the conduct of a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and activity of VCN-01 in patients with refractory retinoblastoma. The Collaboration and License Agreement provides that if the trial results are positive and VCN is interested in continuing with the development of VCN-01 for the treatment of retinoblastoma; (a) the parties undertake to apply their best efforts to negotiate and, where appropriate, sign an agreement to collaborate in the development and execution of the following phases of the development of VCN-01 for the treatment of retinoblastoma; (b) the Institution shall grant to VCN an exclusive, worldwide and indefinite license to use and exploit the trial results and their possible patents exclusively for the treatment of retinoblastoma; (c) VCN shall pay the Foundation five hundred thousand Euros (€500,000), subject to reduction for any public and/or private economic aid that third parties may grant to the Institution for the conduct of the trial and/or any advance payments made by VCN before the end of the trial; (d) VCN shall pay the Foundation three hundred twenty thousand Euros (€320,000) once following the trial results a pivotal study, to be carried out by VCN, has been completed which allows it to obtain the marketing authorization of the product following from the results, which payment must be made within a maximum period of four (4) years from the date on which Institution has delivered the final report of the trial to VCN ; and (e) the parties will use their best efforts to negotiate and, where appropriate, sign a product supply agreement in order that the Hospital can use VCN-01 for compassionate use in the treatment of retinoblastoma. The Collaboration and License Agreement continues in force and effect until all obligations arising from the trial have been fulfilled, subject to early termination for a material breach by a party of any of their contractual and/or legal obligations, or, in the case of any other type of breach, when the breaching party has been asked in writing to remedy the breach and the breach is not cured within thirty (30) days from the date on which the written request was sent. 
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis Clinical Trial Agreement
On August 7, 2019, we entered into a clinical trial agreement (“CTA”) with Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (“Washington University”) to conduct a Phase 1b/2a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in up to 36 adult allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients (the “Study”). Under the terms of the CTA, we will serve as the sponsor of the Study and supply SYN-004 (ribaxamase), as well as compensate Washington University for all research services to be provided in connection with the Study which is estimated to cost approximately $3,200,000. Dr. Erik R. Dubberke, Professor of Medicine and Clinical Director, Transplant Infectious Diseases at Washington University will serve as the principal investigator of the trial in collaboration with his Washington University colleague Dr. Mark A. Schroeder, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation and Leukemia.
The CTA continues in effect until completion of all obligations under the CTA. Either party may terminate the CTA prior to completion of its obligations (i) if authorization of the study is withdrawn by the FDA; (ii) if the emergence of any adverse reaction or side effect with SYN-004 (ribaxamase) administered in the Study is of such magnitude or incidence in the opinion of either party to support termination; or (iii) upon a breach of the terms of the CTA if the breaching party fails to cure the breach within 30 days after receipt of notice. We have the right to terminate the CTA (i) effective immediately if Washington University fails to perform the study in accordance with the terms of the protocol, the CTA or applicable laws or regulations or if Washington University or the principal investigator become debarred or (ii) upon 14 days written notice and Washington University has the right to terminate the CTA upon 14 days notice if the principal investigator becomes unable to perform or complete the Study and the parties have not, prior to the expiration of such fourteen (14) day period, agreed to an alternative principal investigator.
Massachusetts General Hospital Exclusive Option License Agreement
On May 27, 2020, we entered into an agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital (“MGH”) granting us an option for an exclusive license to intellectual property and technology related to the use of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (“IAP”) to maintain gastrointestinal (GI) and microbiome health, diminish systemic inflammation, and treat age-related diseases. If executed, we plan to use this license in the advancement of an expanded clinical development program for SYN-020, our proprietary recombinant version of bovine IAP currently in pre-clinical development. Under the terms of the agreement, we are granted exclusive rights to negotiate a worldwide license with MGH to commercially develop SYN-020 to treat and prevent metabolic and inflammatory diseases associated with aging. During the second quarter of 2021, we announced an amendment to our option for an exclusive license agreement with MGH to include intellectual property and technology related to the use of SYN-020 to inhibit liver fibrosis in select diseases, including NAFLD. To date, we have not exercised the option.

The University of Texas at Austin License Agreement and Sponsored Research Agreement
On December 19, 2012, we entered into a Patent License Agreement (the “Texas License Agreement”) with UT Austin for the exclusive license of the right to use, develop, manufacture, market and commercialize certain research and patents related to pertussis antibodies developed in the lab of Dr. Jennifer A. Maynard, Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering. In accordance with the terms of the Texas License Agreement we made the following payments to the UT Austin: a payment of past patent expenses, an annual payment of $50,000 per year commencing on the effective date through December 31, 2014 and a $25,000 payment on December 31, 2015. The Texas License Agreement also provides that UT Austin is entitled to milestone payments of $50,000 upon commencement of Phase 1 Clinical Trials, $100,000 upon commencement of Phase 3 Clinical Trials, $250,000 upon NDA submission in the United States, $100,000 upon European Medicines Agency approval and $100,000 upon regulatory approval in an Asian country. In addition, the University is entitled to a running royalty upon Net Product Sales and Net Service Sales (as defined in the Texas License Agreement and currently projected to be 2037 (not accounting for possible extensions)). The License Agreement terminates upon the expiration of the patent rights (as defined in the Texas License Agreement); provided, however that the Texas License Agreement is subject to early termination by us in our discretion and by the University for a breach of the Texas License Agreement by us.
In connection with the Texas License Agreement, we also entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (the “Sponsored Research Agreement”) with the University pursuant to which the University will perform certain research work related to pertussis under the direction of Dr. Jennifer Maynard. All inventions conceived during such research shall be subject to the Texas License Agreement and we will obtain certain rights to patents and technology developed during the course of such research. We paid the University a fixed fee for the first year of $303,287 and the second and third years of $316,438 and $328,758, respectively. The Sponsored Research Agreement was amended on October 22, 2015 to extend its termination date to January 15, 2017: on September 2, 2016 to extend the agreement until January 15, 2018; on August 22, 2017 to extend the agreement until January 17, 2019;on August 24, 2018 to extend the agreement until January 21, 2021; and again on August 18, 2020 which extended the agreement until January 17, 2023; provided, however, the Sponsored Research Agreement is subject to early termination upon the written agreement of the parties, a default in the material obligations under the Sponsored Research Agreement which remain uncured for 60 days after receipt of notice, automatically upon our bankruptcy or insolvency and by us in our sole discretion at any time after the one year anniversary of the date of execution thereof upon no less than 90 days’ notice. Upon a termination or due to a breach by the University, we will only be responsible for all reasonable expenses that do not exceed the fixed annual amount and that are incurred by the University prior to the termination date for services performed prior to the termination date.
We have an issued U.S. patent and patents pending in the U.S. and internationally (e.g. Europe, China, Japan, Australia, and China) on compositions and uses of SYN-005 that are co-owned by UT Austin and ourselves or licensed to us, and we have an issued U.S. patent and patent applications on other pertussis mAbs licensed from UT Austin.
Manufacturing
SYN-004 and SYN-020
Our product candidates SYN-004 and SYN-020 are biologics that can be readily synthesized by processes that we have developed; however, the manufacturing for our clinical programs, including SYN-004 and SYN-020 may require long lead times and is subject to potential COVID-19 related global supply chain interruptions. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of these product candidates for preclinical and clinical activities. We rely on third-party contract manufacturers, and in most cases only one third-party, to manufacture critical raw materials, drug substance and final drug product for our research, preclinical development and clinical trial activities. Commercial quantities of any drugs we seek to develop will have to be manufactured in facilities and by processes that comply with the FDA and other regulations, and we plan to rely on third parties to manufacture commercial quantities of products we successfully develop through FDA approval. We believe we have sufficient quantities of SYN-004 and SYN-020 to complete our planned Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 and our planned Phase 1 clinical trials of SYN-020, and are working with qualified third-party vendors for the manufacture of additional quantities of SYN-004 and SYN-020 for potential future preclinical studies and clinical trials.
VCN-01 & VCN-11
Our oncolytic virus platform viruses (e.g. VCN-01, VCN-11) are biologics that can be readily synthesized by processes that we have developed in collaboration with Contract and Development Manufacturing Organizations (CDMOs) such as Thermo Fisher, BioReliance, GenIBET, and others. VCN does not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates, VCN-01 and VCN-11 but it does produce and test viruses and virus processes at VCN facilities in Spain. VCN’s cell and virus seed 

20



stocks and Master/Working banks for current and future production. Our cells for manufacturing are approved by and licensed from US regulatory authorities. Clinical and commercial supplies will be manufactured in facilities and by processes that comply with the FDA and other regulatory agency requirements. VCN plans to rely on third parties to manufacture commercial quantities of products that we successfully develop through regulatory approval. VCN has contracted with two CDMOs to provide what it believes are adequate clinical supplies for our planned clinical trials. 
VCN’s upstream and downstream processes for producing oncolytic viruses are well understood in the industry and use industry standard cell factories and single use bioreactors for manufacturing. All downstream purifications employ single-use columns and filters, and release testing is performed by third-party vendors using qualified or validated assays. Critical quality attributes and other product testing specifications for our clinical supplies are agreed to with regulatory authorities prior to release and use. 
VCN anticipates some delays in manufacturing due to COVID-19 impact on the supply chain. Its impact, if any, on the timing of future clinical trials is currently unknown.
Research and Development
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred approximately $7.8 million and $5.1 million, respectively, in research and development expenses.
Government Regulation
In the U.S., the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storing, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies, including primarily the FDA. Our proposed activities may also be regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our proposed products may be manufactured, distributed and sold. The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacture and labeling of prescription drugs, such as those that we intend to distribute. FDA regulations require us and our suppliers to meet relevant cGMP regulations for the preparation, packing, labeling, and storage of all drugs.
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing FDA regulation, including record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences, submitting periodic reports, drug sampling and distribution requirements, manufacturing or labeling changes, record-keeping requirements, and compliance with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections for GMP compliance, imposing procedural and documentation requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with these regulations could result, among other things, in suspension of regulatory approval, recalls, suspension of production or injunctions, seizures, or civil or criminal sanctions. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future subcontractors will be able to comply with these regulations.
The FDA regulates prescription drug labeling and promotion activities in the United States. The FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting the marketing of products for unapproved uses. The FDA permits the promotion of drugs for unapproved uses in certain circumstances, subject to stringent requirements. We and our product candidates are subject to a variety of state laws and regulations which may hinder our ability to market our products. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval by foreign regulatory authorities must be obtained prior to commencing clinical trials, and sales and marketing efforts in those countries. These approval procedures vary in complexity from country to country, and the processes may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. We may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations now or in the future.
The FDA, comparable foreign regulators and state and local pharmaceutical regulators impose substantial requirements upon clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These and other entities regulate research and development and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, and promotion of our products. The drug approval process required by the FDA under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and Public Health Service Act (for biologics) generally involves:

● | preclinical laboratory and animal tests;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | submission of an IND, prior to commencing human clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy for intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21




● | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; and
--+--------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA.
--+------------------------------------------

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, and animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Certain preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring them to be replicated. In some cases, long-term preclinical studies are conducted concurrently with clinical studies.
We will submit the preclinical test results, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we begin human clinical trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after filing, unless the FDA raises questions about conduct of the trials outlined in the IND and imposes a clinical hold, in which case, the IND sponsor and FDA must resolve the matters before clinical trials can begin. It is possible that our submission may not result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. The timing and requirements of IND review may differ from the FDA in other countries, potentially delaying study initiation at sites in those countries.
Clinical trials must be supervised by qualified investigators in accordance with current good clinical practice (cGCP) regulations, which include informed consent requirements. Each study must be approved and monitored by the appropriate Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) or ethics committees (ECs) which are periodically informed of the study’s progress, adverse events and changes in research. Annual updates are submitted to the FDA and comparable foreign regulators (if required) with more frequent reporting if certain serious adverse events occur.
Human clinical trials of drug candidates typically have three sequential phases that may overlap:
Phase 1:   The drug is initially tested in healthy human subjects or patients for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion.
Phase 2:   The drug is studied in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, determine efficacy for specific diseases and establish dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
Phase 3:   When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range is effective with an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety, are undertaken in an expanded patient population, often at geographically dispersed sites.
We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3 testing of our product candidates within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA or comparable foreign regulator, an IRB/EC or the IND sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that subjects or patients are exposed to unacceptable health risk. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, we also must prepare, within 60 days of an End of Phase 2 meeting, a pediatric study plan or request for waiver or deferral of pediatric studies in the indication under development. Concurrent with these trials and studies, we also develop chemistry and physical characteristics data and finalize a manufacturing process in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must conform to consistency and quality standards, and we must develop methods for testing the quality, purity, and potency of the final products. Appropriate packaging is selected and tested, and chemistry stability studies are conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life. Results of the foregoing are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA (or BLA in case of biologic products) for marketing and commercial shipment approval. The FDA reviews each NDA or BLA submitted and may request additional information. A 60-day period after the sponsor’s submission of an NDA or BLA is used by the FDA to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, in which case the application is accepted for filing. The timing and requirements of NDA or BLA review may differ from the FDA in other countries,
Once the FDA accepts the NDA or BLA for filing, it begins its in-depth review. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may disagree with our interpretation of the data submitted or identify new concerns. The process may be significantly extended by requests for new information or clarification of information already submitted. As part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians. Manufacturing establishments often are inspected prior to NDA or BLA approval to assure compliance with GMPs and with manufacturing commitments made in the application.

22



Submission of an NDA or BLA with clinical data requires payment of a substantial fee. In return, the FDA assigns a goal for review and decision on the application, in which the FDA may approve or deny the NDA or BLA, or issue a complete response letter outlining information needed to support approval, including a potential need for additional clinical data. Even if these data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide the NDA or BLA does not satisfy approval criteria. If the FDA approves the NDA or BLA, the product becomes available for marketing. Product approval may be withdrawn if regulatory compliance is not maintained or safety problems occur. The FDA may require post-marketing studies, also known as Phase 4 studies, as a condition of approval, and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) requires surveillance programs to monitor approved products that have been commercialized. The agency has the power to require changes in labeling or prohibit further marketing based on the results of post-marketing surveillance.
Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will approve any of our products on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications or uses.
Even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business.
The FDA’s or comparable foreign regulatory agency may change their policies, and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our potential products. Increased attention to the containment of health care costs worldwide could result in new government regulations materially adverse to our business. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
Orphan Drug Act
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the name of the sponsor, identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process, but does provide certain advantages, such as a waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) fees, enhanced access to FDA staff and potential waiver of pediatric research requirements.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Orphan Drug Designation is also available in Europe from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and provides for 10 years of market exclusivity if granted. The requirements, costs and timing for obtaining and maintaining EMA Orphan Drug Designation differ from the FDA.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted anti-kickback statues and false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created several federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to the delivery of or payments for healthcare benefits, items or services. HIPAA and its implementing regulations also established uniform federal standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information.
Because of the breadth of these and other laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company also must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can initiate clinical trials or market products in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the EU generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of pharmaceutical development, nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to relevant competent authorities for clinical trials authorization and to the EMA or to competent authorities in EU Member States for a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by competent authorities in EU Member States or the European Commission before the product can be marketed and sold in the EU.
Data Privacy
Strict data privacy laws regulating the collection, transmission, storage and use of employee data and consumers’ personally-identifying information are evolving in the European Union, U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Outside of the United States, the laws, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, and other processing of personal information. For example, in the European Union, the collection and use of personal data are governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”). The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the European Union. member states governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations on entities subject to the GDPR, including but not limited to: (i) accountability and transparency requirements, and enhanced requirements for obtaining valid consent from data subjects; (ii) obligations to consider data protection as any new products or services are developed and to limit the amount of personal data processed; (iii) obligations to comply with the data protection rights of data subjects; and (iv) obligations to report certain personal data breaches to governmental authorities and individuals. Data protection authorities from the different E.U. member states and other European countries may enforce the GDPR and national data protection laws differently, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to the complexity of processing European personal data. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws may result in significant monetary fines and other administrative penalties (the GDPR authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater) as well as civil 

24



liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Additionally, expenses associated with compliance could reduce our operating margins.
The GDPR also prohibits the transfer of personal data from the E.U. to countries outside of the E.U. unless made to a country deemed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection for personal data or accomplished by means of an approved data transfer mechanism (e.g., standard contractual clauses). Data protection authority guidance and enforcement actions that restrict companies’ ability to transfer data may increase risk relating to data transfers or make it more difficult or impossible to transfer E.U. personal data to the U.S.
Competitive Environment
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multi-national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies developing both generic and proprietary therapies to treat serious diseases. Many of these companies are well-established and possess technical, human, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many of our potential competitors have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that afford these companies potential research and development and commercialization advantages in the therapeutic areas we are currently pursuing. 
Academic research centers, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce products directly competitive to those being developed by us. In addition, many of these competitors may be able to obtain patent protection, obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals and begin commercial sales of their products before us.

VCN OV products are designed to be systemically, intratumorally or intravitreally injected; selectively replicate only in tumor cells versus normal host cells; have reduced liver tropism compared to wild type adenovirus type 5; and express an enzyme (PH20) that

degrades the tumor stroma barrier. If confirmed in Phase 2 and later clinical trials, these features significantly differentiate VCN products from competing OVs and will enable VCN products to be co-administered with other therapeutic modalities such as chemotherapy and immune therapy to improve cancer treatment outcomes. 
Corporate History
Our predecessor, Sheffield Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was incorporated in 1986, and in 2006 engaged in a reverse merger with Pipex Therapeutics, Inc., a publicly-traded Delaware corporation formed in 2001. After the reverse merger, we changed our name to Pipex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and in October 2008 we changed our name to Adeona Pharmaceuticals, Inc. On October 15, 2009, we engaged in a merger with a wholly owned subsidiary for the purpose of reincorporating in the State of Nevada. On February 15, 2012, we changed our name to Synthetic Biologics, Inc. On August 10, 2018, we effected a one for thirty-five reverse stock split of our authorized, issued and outstanding common stock.
Human Capital
We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. Prior to the VCN Acquisition, we employed 9 individuals, all of whom were full-time employees, of which 5 were part of our research and clinical development team and clinical development team and 4 were part of our financial reporting and accounting team. As of March 16, 2022, we employed 16 individuals, all of whom are full-time employees, of which 5 were part of our research and clinical development team in the United States and six were part of VCN’s research and clinical development team located in Spain, one is part of VCN’s management team located in Spain and 4 were part of our financial reporting and accounting team located in the United States. 
A significant number of our management and professional employees have had prior experience with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. None of our employees in the United States are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and management considers relations with our employees to be in good standing. As is the usual situation in Spain, all the employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining system specific for the pharma sector. Although we continually seek to add additional talent to our work force, management believes that it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.
Competitive Pay and Benefits
Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:

● | we provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | all employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a retirement plan and life and disability/accident coverage. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including flexible time-off, telemedicine, and unpaid parental leave.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. Accordingly, with the global spread of the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, we have implemented plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the safety of our employees and our business, which include:

● | adding work from home flexibility;
--+-----------------------------------

● | increasing cleaning protocols across all locations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------
