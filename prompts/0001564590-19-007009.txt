ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 We are a trusted partner for the innovation of advanced materials using high throughput experimentation.  Advanced materials are critical to sustaining and advancing many industries, including semiconductor and semiconductor related industries.  Using traditional experimental techniques, it can take many years to discover new advanced materials and many more years to deploy them in the marketplace. By leveraging our proprietary High Productivity Combinatorial (HPC) equipment platform, advanced characterization ability and multi-disciplinary development team, we strive to enable our customers to more rapidly discover advanced materials and tailor them to suit their needs.  
 Our HPC platform, which consists of our Tempus™ processing tools, our unique, automated characterization methods, and our Informatics analysis software, is purpose-built for research and development (R&D) using combinatorial process systems in concert with established chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) deposition methods. Combinatorial processing is a methodology for experimentation, discovery and development that employs parallel and other high-throughput experimentation, which allows for R&D experimentation at speeds up to 100 times faster than conventional R&D platforms that are optimized for manufacturing rather than for R&D.  Our development team included approximately 54 scientists and engineers (of whom approximately 56% have advanced degrees) or approximately 34% of our total headcount as of December 31, 2018.  
 We currently target large markets that rely on advanced materials for differentiation.  Within these broad markets, we target customers that have track records of technological innovation, have significant materials-based R&D, and are pursuing technical advancements that are critical to their success and strategy. Samsung and SK hynix accounted for 10% or more of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Samsung and Micron Technology, Inc. (“Micron”) each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, and Guardian, Micron, Samsung and SK hynix each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. To date, we have received the substantial majority of our revenue from customers in the semiconductor, glass, advanced alloys, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and flat-panel display markets.
 Generally, our approach is most relevant to industries that rely heavily upon advanced thin film materials such as those achieved using PVD and ALD processing tools; however, our approach is also relevant to discovering and understanding advanced materials more broadly, including advanced bulk materials such as metal alloys.  Historically, we have partnered most extensively in the semiconductor industry and particularly in the area of semiconductor memory such as dynamic RAM (DRAM), non-volatile memory (NVM) and phase-change memory (PCM) technologies.  Going forward, we plan to continue growing our footprint with semiconductor device makers, while expanding our engagement with semiconductor materials and equipment makers.
 We maintain a flexible engagement model that allows our customers to choose how best to leverage our HPC platform and whether and how to work with our development team.  Prior to 2015, we offered only multi-year collaborative development programs (CDPs), which typically required the customer to pay a fixed annual fee during the engagement and an ongoing royalty stream upon our customer’s commercialization of technology we developed under the program.  Such engagements typically took nine to twenty-four months to negotiate and often were conducted at or below cost to secure the royalty obligation, which was contingent upon our customer’s successful introduction of the developed technology under the CDP. Due to CDP contracts having a relatively long sales cycle and other reasons, since 2015, our preferred approach has been to engage with customers using a multi-year umbrella agreement that allows our customers to selectively engage in multiple projects, each typically having a duration of six to twelve months. With these multi-year umbrella agreements, we typically generate program revenue through contracted service-based fees that are collected upon the completion of projects and/or upon the completion of certain milestones.  For example, a service-based fee could include using our HPC platform to perform certain research services from scanning and screening new material combinations to achieving certain performance objectives using new material combinations. These multi-year umbrella agreements also can include success fees or royalties depending on how the project leverages our development team or incorporates our background technology. While the CDP model remains available to customers who prefer it, our baseline customer

engagement strategy no longer includes a patent licensing component but instead relies upon program revenue being generated through service-based fees. Our new flexible engagement model has substantially reduced our sales cycle and improved our operating results.
 We believe there are opportunities for us to develop our own advanced materials while preserving the trusted relationship with our customers.  By pursuing the discovery and development of novel materials required for new applications, we believe we can effectively complement our current customer’s markets.  We believe that the licensing of our proprietary materials and techniques has potential to produce additional future revenues.
 Our Advantage
 We have pioneered, developed and patented a proprietary platform and methodology for improving R&D in our target markets. Our strengths include:
  
• | Proprietary and patented HPC platform. Our HPC platform employs proprietary and patented combinatorial methods to parallel and rapid-serial process up to 192 experiments on a single substrate as compared to conventional methods, which typically allow only a single experiment at a time. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible technology platform configurable for and extendable to multiple markets. Our HPC platform can be configured for many applications and extended to address a broad set of markets. Because of the similarities and synergies in materials deposition, manufacturing processes and device integration complexities across markets, our platform allows us to create unified workflows and support innovation across multiple markets. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seasoned engineering team with multi-disciplinary expertise. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and engineers with expertise across various disciplines, fields and technologies, including materials science, chemistry, physics, engineering, process equipment development, software and informatics, process development and integration, device technologies and device integration. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deep expertise in advanced materials, processes, integration and device architectures. We have accelerated innovation for a broad set of customers across multiple markets. Our team and our platform enable more rapid comprehension and learning about advanced materials, processes, integration and device architectures, some of which is applicable across markets. We generate our own IP such as materials characteristics, optimized processes and interoperability of systems and architectures that can be applicable in many fields of use and potentially could result in us being able to generate additional license-related fees. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our revenue is built on customer programs and licensing fees. Our customer programs are designed to generate predictable services revenue throughout the length of the engagement as our multi-year umbrella contracts include service-based fees that are collected upon the completion of projects or upon the completion of certain milestones. In some cases, we also receive success fees or licensing fees for our work and technology, but this is not typical of most of our customer engagements.

 Embedded throughout our platform, which is a combination of hardware and software, our proprietary technology is based upon the parallel and/or rapid serial experimentation capabilities of combinatorial methods. HPC methods generally refer to techniques that vary materials, unit processes, process, and device integration sequences across multiple regions of one or more substrates, the output of which can then be evaluated in parallel or rapid serial fashion. Our informatics software and analytical methods characterize and analyze these combinations of materials, unit processes, process, and device integration sequences for the most promising solutions in a structured, automated and throughput-matched fashion. The relationship between materials, processes, integration and device output are established earlier in the development process, so that performance and manufacturability considerations are taken into account from the outset, instead of late in the R&D process.

We begin the development and discovery process by working with our customers to design experiments to synthesize, characterize and understand the material sets they want to explore.  We then use our HPC platform to run those experiments.  Once an experiment is processed, the data sets of each experiment are stored in a secure database and analyzed for desired properties. As with processing, our clean room labs include a broad array of characterization and metrology instruments and software to evaluate different properties under a wide variety of process conditions. These properties include physical, electrical, mechanical, thermal, chemical, and optical properties. In general, we are able to design, process and characterize tens to hundreds of experimental results in a single day.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our IP, including patents, trade secrets and know-how. We have patented and continue to seek patent protection for combinatorial methods and systems included in our HPC platform, and we will also seek patents for advanced materials and related technologies we develop outside of development services for our customers, such as technologies developed as internal research and development or part of a joint development effort with a partner. Our intellectual property rights have terms that expire between 2019 and 2035.
Our Customers
 Our customers serve large and growing markets, including the markets for semiconductors, glass, advanced alloys, LEDs, flat-panel displays, and other applications. Success in these markets requires rapid and cost-effective product innovation, fast time-to-market, competitive pricing, production scalability and the ability to achieve specific product performance requirements. Our semiconductor customers’ products are typically manufactured using thin-film deposition of advanced materials through customized processes that create a specific device architecture. These thin-film structures must then be scaled and integrated into cost-effective manufacturing processes to serve high-volume end markets. Conventional R&D approaches are increasingly challenged by the ever increasing device complexity and the market need to manage innovation in our target markets.
 Empowered with our inter-disciplinary team and unique technology through our HPC platform, we believe we are well positioned to assist manufacturing industries that increasingly rely on the discovery and introduction of new materials, which traditionally have required intensive, time-consuming experimentation due to the fact that advanced materials are not well-understood and accurate, robust models do not exist. Ironically, the greater expertise and higher costs required to discover and introduce advanced materials have led to increased specialization among materials, capital equipment, semiconductor manufacturing and IC (integrated circuit) design companies. This specialization has left gaps in the industry knowledge base with respect to the complex interactions among materials science, process technology, device integration and the ability to scale to high-volume, high-performance IC production.  Our HPC platform allows us to accelerate the rate of experimentation, and our inter-disciplinary team has been assembled to address such gaps.
 The majority of our revenue during 2018 came from Samsung and SK hynix, which represented a combined 75% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. The majority of our revenue during 2017 came from Micron and Samsung which represented a combined 70% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017.  The majority of our revenue during 2016 came from Guardian, Micron, Samsung, and SK hynix, which represented a combined 75% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016.
 Research and Development
 We conduct R&D activities for customers and for internal research and development on both workflow platform development and application R&D. As of December 31, 2018, we employed a research and development team of 70 full-time employees. This R&D team includes many experienced engineers, scientists and managers with advanced degrees from leading universities around the world and experience with leading chip manufacturers, solar PV companies and equipment and materials suppliers. We believe these R&D professionals on our team have enabled us to develop our HPC platform, support customer programs, implement our technology roadmap rapidly and provide us with the foundation for our technology advancement in the future.

We devote a substantial portion of our resources to engineering of our next-generation platforms by integrating future generations of technology and developing standardized software and hardware modules. We work closely with multiple vendors during the development of new workflows or workflow modifications for use in our future platforms. The synergies among existing and new workflows often enable us to operate with adjacent vertical technologies. Our R&D expenses were $17.2 million, $21.6 million and $28.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively; this represented approximately 51%, 58% and 59%, of our revenue in those years, respectively.
 Competition
 The principal capabilities required to be competitive in our market include technical expertise, processes and integration capabilities, diversity of platform offerings, development speed and performance, quality and reliability of engineers, depth of collaboration with customers and technical support. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors because of the breadth of capabilities of our HPC platform, the depth of multi-disciplinary expertise of our internal research team and external engineering teams who collaborate with customers and our use of combinatorial processing and throughput matched characterization and analysis. These differentiating factors allow us to explore more comprehensive materials sets and provide faster results to our customers. We are not aware of any companies that currently compete or have to date competed with us in the use of combinatorial methods for thin-film development; however, we do believe that we compete for the R&D resources of our customers with third-party IP licensors, equipment suppliers, industry consortia, alliance partnerships and university research teams. In addition, many of our customers design, develop, manufacture and market solutions based on their own unique device architectures and develop their own intellectual property in-house.
 A portion of our revenue is generated from the sales of end products by our customers, and our competitive position therefore is dependent on their competitive positions. The markets for our customers' products that incorporate technology developed through our programs are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. These changes result in frequent product introductions, short product development cycles and increased product capabilities typically representing significant price and performance improvements.
 Environmental Regulation
 We are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing, among other matters, emissions and discharges of hazardous materials into the air and water, the use, generation, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes, remediation of contamination and employee health and safety. In addition, under certain of these environmental laws, liability can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault. Our operations involve the use of hazardous materials and produce hazardous waste, and we could become liable for any injury or contamination that could arise due to such use or disposal of these materials. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations or to obtain or maintain required environmental permits could result in the imposition of substantial civil and criminal fines and sanctions, could require operational changes or limits or the installation of costly equipment or otherwise lead to third party claims. Future environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, or the discovery of previously unknown contamination or violations of such laws and regulations could require us to incur costs, or become the basis for new or increased liabilities or subject us to fines or other sanctions.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 88 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas; Backlog
 We derive a significant portion of our revenue from customers based in foreign countries, particularly those based in Asia, including Japan. Revenue generated from customers in Asia, including Japan, accounted for 76%, 68% and 51% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  We expect that a significant portion of our total future revenue will continue to be derived from companies based in Asia and Japan.
