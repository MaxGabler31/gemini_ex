ITEM 1.
BUSINESS

Background
 
Intelligent Buying, Inc. was incorporated in the State of California on March 22, 2004. On March 22, 2004, the Company issued 10,000 shares of the Companys common stock (an aggregate of 20,000 shares) to its founders, Eugene Malobrodsky and David Gorodyansky for a cash consideration of $200. On March 22, 2006, the Company issued 1,250,000 shares of its Preferred Stock to each of Messrs. Malobrodsky and Gorodyansky (2,500,000 Preferred Shares in the aggregate) in exchange for the 20,000 shares of the Companys common stock which had been previously issued. Both prior to the exchange and at the time of the exchange, Messrs. Malobrodsky and Gorodyansky owned 100% of the stock of the Company. The decision to exchange their common shares for preferred shares was intended to enable them to maintain a particular percentage holding of the Company and enable them to maintain voting control over the Company. On September 16, 2010, all 2,500,000 shares of preferred stock were converted into 5,000,000 shares of common stock. Thereafter, no shares of preferred stock remained issued and outstanding.
 
On January 28, 2015, we filed a Report with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K, which announced that (a) our principal shareholders had sold their shares of common stock to AMS Encino Investments, Inc., a California corporation controlled by Hector Guerrero, and (b) our principal shareholders were resigning as our officers and directors, and were appointing Mr. Guerrero and Jonathan Herzog as our new officers and directors. That change of control was completed on February 9, 2015.

As of May 31, 2018, AMS Encino Investments, Inc. AMS) entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement) pursuant to which AMS agreed to sell to Bagel Hole, Inc. (the Purchaser), the 5,753,333 shares of common stock (the Shares) of the Company owned by AMS, constituting approximately 79.3% of the Companys 7,256,600 issued and outstanding common shares, for $90,000. The transaction was consummated on June 15, 2018; and as a result of the sale there was a change of control of the Company. The Purchaser transferred 100,000 of those shares to unaffiliated persons. There is no family relationship or other relationship between AMS and the Purchaser.
 
As a result of the sale under the Stock Purchase Agreement, Hector Guerrero, who was CEO of AMS and was the Companys sole officer and director, resigned as the Companys sole officer and director, and appointed Philip Romanzi, who is the owner of the Purchaser, as the sole director of the Company. Mr. Romanzi is now the Companys sole officer and director.
 
Our Business Generally
 
The Company was engaged from 2004 in the business of asset management and sales of high-end computerized networking equipment to emerging high technology companies. Commencing in 2011, the Company began providing advertising services to promote products and services of third parties (primarily a related company, Anchorfree Wireless, Inc.) to the Companys customer base. Under this business model, third parties pay the Company a fee to disseminate their advertising to the Companys customer base.
 
The Company maintained its business model and operations described above, since the change of control on February 9, 2105, until October, 2016, when management discontinued operations. Since then, management has explored other business opportunities, in an effort to enhance shareholder value. However, as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has not acquired, and has not entered into any agreement to acquire, any assets or businesses. Therefore, as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company is a shell, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had one person working for the Company, consisting of its CEO, who was not on payroll.
