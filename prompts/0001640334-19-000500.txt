ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Corporate History and Recent Developments
 
Love International Group, Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on May 23, 2013 under the name Quintec Corp. At formation, the Company was authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share.
 
The Company was originally formed to develop a way to make toy and trinket shopping more interactive and more fun. Prior to November 2015, when the Company underwent a change in control and a change in management, and the new management adopted a new business plan based on the development of an online, cross-border e-commerce platform for promotion and sales of foreign specialties and other discount branded products to worldwide customers, our primary mission was to develop and install 3D printing kiosks in shopping centers throughout Chile and eventually all of South America, which would allow customers to create 3D printed products on location, while they wait or shop for other items. The idea behind the technology was to allow customers to print toys and gifts at a low price, in a very interactive manner.
 
On August 13, 2013, we increased the number of authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, from 100,000,000 to 150,000,000.
 
On November 11, 2015, a change in control of the Company occurred, whereby Walter Lee, the-then sole officer and director, sold 15,000,000 of his shares of common stock, representing 51.8% of the then voting power of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company, in a private transaction to Yong Qiang Yang (8,250,000 shares) and Wei Min Jin (6,750,000 shares), who subsequently became officers and directors of the Company. Mr. Lee sold the remainder of his shares (5,000,000 shares) to other individuals in separate transactions not involving a public sale or distribution. After the sale of stock, Walter Lee had no further ownership of any voting securities of the Company.
 
On November 30, 2015, the Company accepted the resignation of Walter Lee from his positions as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and member of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors appointed Yong Qiang Yang as President of the Company and a member of the Board of Directors, and Wei Min Jin as Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the Company and a member of the Board of Directors, effective November 30, 2015.
 
All references above to share and per share data have not been adjusted to give effect of the forward stock split (see below).
 
On January 20, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a change in the Company’s fiscal year end from January 31 to December 31.
 
On February 1, 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority approved: (a) changing the name of the Company to Love International Group, Inc. (the “Name Change”); (b) increasing the aggregate number of authorized shares of common stock of the Company from one hundred and fifty million (150,000,000) shares, par value $0.001, to one billion (1,000,000,000) shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Authorized Share Increase”); (c) a 10-for-1 forward stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the “Forward Split”; together with the Name Change and Authorized Share Increase, the “Corporate Actions”); and (d) a new trading symbol of LOVV.
 
On February 5, 2016, the Corporate Actions became effective and the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company became 289,333,360.
 
On March 7, 2016, the trading symbol changed to LOVV and a new CUSIP number (54714U107) was assigned to the Company’s common stock.

Contractual Arrangements with Shenzhen Qianhai Lefu E-Commerce Co., Ltd.
 
The following is a summary of the currently effective contracts (the “Shenzhen Lefu Restructuring Agreements”) by and among our subsidiary, the WFOE, Shenzhen Lefu and/ or the shareholders of Shenzhen Lefu.
 
Under PRC laws, certain restrictions are placed on an acquisition of a PRC entity by an offshore special purpose vehicle owned by one or more PRC residents. To comply with these restrictions, prior to the Merger, the WFOE entered into and consummated certain contractual arrangements with Shenzhen Lefu and its shareholders pursuant to which the WFOE will provide Shenzhen Lefu including its subsidiaries, branch offices and other investment funds) with commercial, technical and consulting services. Through these contractual arrangements, the WFOE has the ability to substantially influence Shenzhen Lefu’s daily operations and financial affairs, appoint its senior executives and approve all matters requiring shareholder approval. As a result of these contractual arrangements, which enable our wholly-owned subsidiary, the WFOE, to control Shenzhen Lefu and operate our business in the PRC through Shenzhen Lefu, we are considered the primary beneficiary of Shenzhen Lefu.
 
Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement
 
The Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement between Shenzhen Lefu and WFOE provides that Shenzhen Lefu appoints WFOE as its exclusive service provider to provide Shenzhen Lefu including its subsidiaries, branch offices and other investment funds) with commercial, technical and consulting services, the scope of which is to be determined by WFOE from time to time.

The combination of Shenzhen Lefu and Shanghai Lefu are considered under common control. The method used to present a common-control transaction that results in a change in the reporting entity is pooling of interests. A pooling of interests was a method of accounting for a merger of two businesses. The assets and liabilities and operations of the two businesses were combined at their historical carrying amounts, and all historical periods were adjusted as if the businesses had always been combined. Similarly, in a common-control transaction, the receiving entity retrospectively adjusts its financial statements to include the transferred net assets and any related operations for all periods for which the entities or net assets were under common control.
 
Business Overview
 
The Company was originally formed to develop a way to make toy and trinket shopping more interactive and more fun, with the primary mission to develop and install 3D printing kiosks in shopping centers throughout Chile and eventually all of South America, which would allow customers to create 3D printed products on location, while they wait or shop for other items. On November 2015, the Company underwent a change in control and a change in management, and the new management adopted a new business plan based on the development of an online, cross-border e-commerce platform for promotion and sales of foreign specialties and other discount branded products to worldwide customers. From May 18, 2016 to February 11, 2019, our business was to develop an online platform to promote cheap airline tickets and hotels as well as developing and launching a “Do-It-Yourself” (“DIY”) system for users to put together a trip with exotic activities such as hunting, flying a plane, or even piloting a submarine. On February 11, 2019, we completed the Merger pursuant the Share Exchange Agreement; upon the completion of Merger, the business of Lovego Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities became our business. 
 
We are a holding company that operates through our indirectly owned subsidiary Lovego Hong Kong Limited, or, Lovego Hong Kong, a Hong Kong corporation, an entrepreneurial technology-driven e-commerce company providing retail infrastructure service in China. We specialize in providing customers with diverse product lines and a user friendly shopping experience through our mobile application – Lovego App. 
 
We believe that we provide a pleasant online retail experience for consumers. Through Lovego App, we provide customers with what we believe to be rich product lines and a user-friendly shopping experience, and we offer competitive prices for a wide selection of products to be delivered in a speedy and reliable manner. We also provide convenient different online payment options and comprehensive customer service. In order to better control performance and ensure customer satisfaction, we have established strategic co-operation with various express delivery companies to support our online direct sales. Lovego formed one major warehouse located in Jiaxing, Zhejiang province in order to provide faster delivery service for customers and further deepen and expand the business scope of the Company.
 
We have also established what we believe to be a strong relationship with suppliers in the process of developing online direct sales business. 
 
In our online direct sales business, we acquire products from suppliers and sell them directly to customers. We also conduct supplier consignment sales, in which we transfer online orders received to our suppliers for them to fulfil and deliver directly, and we do not need to keep inventory of such products. In addition, we also cooperate with sales agents, including channel agents and commercial agents, to promote and sell our products. We started selling beauty and computer products online in 2016 and have introduced a wide variety of products since then. We significantly expanded our product offerings in 2018 with home appliances and a wide array of general merchandise product categories. We have been continually adding new products and categories since then. 
 
To further expand our business, we made a strategic decision in September, 2018 to include services in our business, and we expect that this will help improve our profitability as well as contribute to our business development and expansion. In our services business, we initially plan to cooperate with a number of off-line stores that mainly focus on travel and beauty industries. We intend to promote their business on the Lovego App, and users can spend their Lefuyou (similar in function to membership points) earned by shopping on Lovego App on purchases made in these off-line stores. This business strategy will lead to a win-win situation where, we can use our customer base and online channel to boost these off-line stores’ revenue generation, and also attract more users to our own sales platform and further enhance our platform’s influence by being able to provide various off-line services to our customers.

We believe that technology is the key to the success of our future business development and the evolution of our business ecosystem. We believe that our proprietary technology platform will have sufficient capacity to support our rapidly growing transaction needs, and will provide us with comprehensive, detailed and accurate operating data.

In addition, as of December 2017, the online shopping population in China reached 533 million, which represented an increase of 14.3% from the end of 2016, accounting for 69.1% of the total Internet users, and the number of users using mobile phone to do online shopping reached 506 million, which represented an increase of 14.7% from the end of 20162.  
 
We believe that the following trends are driving the continued growth of China’s e-commerce industry and are reshaping its future form. First, mobile shopping has become the dominant form of online retail in China, as consumers increasingly use their fragmented time to browse and shop anywhere, anytime. Second, the extensive availability of logistics infrastructure and expansive adoption of mobile payment have made mobile shopping increasingly efficient and convenient. Third, historically less developed cities in China have become an increasingly important market for e-commerce due to the rising spending power and a desire for a better standard of living. Fourth, China has an increasing base of small and micro enterprises which could benefit from and hence help develop more direct access to consumers.
 
The industry we are in is online retail business. Same as any other industry, the recognition and reputation of the retailers among customers, supplier, brands, third party merchants and other service providers contribute significantly to the growth and success of the retailers. Moreover, the online retail industry is characterized by rapid technological evolution, frequent changes in customer requirements and preferences, constant emergence of new products and services embodying new technologies, with introduction to new industry standards and practice, any of which could render the existing technologies and system outdated. So to remain competitive in the industry, the retailers must continually conduct research and development with respect to their online platforms. It is anticipated that the industry will continually expand and evolve.
 
The PRC government extensively regulates the industry where we operate our business. The industry is subject to supervision and regulation by relevant PRC governmental authorities including China Food and Drug Administration and State Administration for Market Regulation (formerly “Administration for Industry and Commerce”). Also, online retailers are required to hold a number of licenses and permits in connection with the online platform operation.

Our Strategy
 
Increase Our Buyer Base and Engagement
 
We plan to increase our marketing efforts to attract more buyers to our platform and convert more existing buyers on our platform to active buyers. We will continue to introduce more interactive features on our platform to enhance buyer engagement and experience. We will also continue to improve the diversity of our buyers and penetrate a larger part of the population.
Expand Merchandise Choices and Offerings
 
We will further expand our merchandise choices to provide more diversified products to our buyers. We plan to leverage our large and active buyer base and our brand to attract new merchants and offer new merchandise choices as well as more product within each category on our platform. We also plan to cooperate existing and new merchants more closely to help them better understand and serve our customers.
Enhance Brand Recognition and Continue to Adhere to Strict Quality Control
 
We believe that building our brand and strengthening the reputation of our platform is crucial to our continued success. We plan to increase our marketing efforts across online and offline channels to enhance user awareness and recognition of our platform. In addition, we will continue to implement strict quality control measures to foster trust from buyers.
Further Improve Technology Capability
 
We seek to continuously strengthen our technologies to improve the efficiency of our platform. We will continue to develop proprietary software and systems to serve our buyers and merchants, such as streamlined merchant services SaaS systems, and standardized quality control systems. We aim to achieve, through these technology improvement initiatives, better buyer experience, deeper understanding by our merchants of their target buyers, and improved productivity and efficiency of both merchants and us.
Pursue Select Strategic Investment and Expansion Opportunities
 
We also plan to selectively pursue strategic investments, alliances and acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and operations. With the right opportunity, we may seek to expand into international markets and bring our products to more buyers.
Attract and Retain Talents
 
We intend to continue devoting substantial resources to seek top talents, in particular engineers having strong technology backgrounds and prior experience in large leading internet companies. We are dedicated to providing employees with diversified work environment and a wide range of career development opportunities. We will continue to invest significant resources in employee career development and training opportunities.
Our Competition
 
The online retail industry in China is intensely competitive. Our current or potential competitors include (1) major e-commerce companies in China that offer a wide range of general merchandise product categories, such as JD mall, VIPShop.com, Amazon China, Pinduoduo and (2) major traditional retailers in China that are moving into online retail space, such as Suning Appliance Company Limited, which operates suning.com, and Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Limited, which operates gome.com.cn. We also face competition from online retail companies in China focused on specific product categories and from traditional retail stores, including those aiming to offer a one-stop shopping experience to customers.

14

 
We anticipate that the online retail market will continually evolve and will continue to experience rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, shifting customer requirements, and frequent innovation. In addition, new and enhanced technologies may increase the competition in the online retail industry. New competitive business models may appear, for example based on new forms of social media or social commerce. We must continually innovate to remain competitive.
 
We also compete with companies making counterfeits of products sold on our platform at a lower prices. We may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use which may adversely affect our sales amounts and harm our reputation eventually.
 
We believe we compete primarily on our ability to provide customers with a diverse portfolio of products, which helps to satisfy customers’ need. We believe we also compete on our ability to provide high-quality product offerings and customer services at competitive prices, which help generate more appeal for our products. We believe we also compete on our ability to provide efficient delivery services, which helps to provide convenience to customers.
 
Our Business Model
 
Since founding our Company, we have focused on developing the business of online direct sales, sales agent sales, supplier consignment sales, and offline stores sales, the operations of which are supported by our proprietary technology platform. The fact that our online direct sales and sales agent business have both grown substantially in size has proved to us, as we believe, that our online direct sales and technology platform will make us a strong player in China’s online retail industry in terms of providing superior customer experience.
Online Direct Sales
 
In our online direct sales business, we acquire products from suppliers and sell them directly to customers. We started selling beauty and computer products online in 2016, and significantly expanded our product offerings in 2018 with home appliances and a wide array of general merchandise product categories, and have been continually adding new products and categories since then. 
Sales Agent Sales
 
Apart from direct sales, we also cooperate with sales agents including channel agents and commercial agents to promote and sell products.
 
Supplier Consignment Sales
 
Under supplier consignment sales, we transfer online orders received to our suppliers for them to fulfil and deliver directly, and we do not need to keep inventory of such products. Therefore the supplier consignment sales mode helps us reduce inventory risk while still providing us an avenue for considerable profits.
Omni-channel Initiatives
 
To achieve a wider vision of our business, we are exploring a variety of omni-channel integration opportunities and innovative business models. Leveraging our well-established technology platform and infrastructures, we believe we are well-positioned to create enhanced shopping experience for consumers as well as improved efficiency for our business partners in the ecosystem.
 
We believe we are well-positioned to provide online-to-offline (O2O) solutions to customers and offline retailers in select locations in China by capitalizing on our strong online presence and leveraging delivery system, we have strategic cooperation with SF Express, ZTO Express and STO Express. SF Express is one of the largest express delivery companies in China, and provides the fastest delivery of products to all regions in China within 24 hours. We focus on the mobile commerce sector and also collaborates with convenience stores to provide consumers with speedy premium shopping experience.
 

15

 
To further expand and develop our business, we made a strategic decision in September 2018 provide certain services to other business companies and expect that such services would help increase profitability more significantly along with other business development and expansion. To provide such services, we plan to first cooperate with a number of other business companies off-line stores that mainly focus on travel and beauty industries. We will promote their business on Lovego App, and our users can spend their Lefuyou (a kind of incentive points) on purchases made in these off-line stores. We believe this business strategy will lead to a win-win situation where, we can use our customer base and online channel to boost these business companies’ revenue generation, and also attract more users to our own sales platform and further enhance our platform’s influence by being able to provide various off-line services to our customers.
 
Our Products and Services
 
Products
 
We continually seek to add more products that appeal to our target customers. The number of products we offer has grown rapidly. We offer eight categories of products including but not limited to: home appliances, mobile handsets, computers and other digital products, furniture and household goods; apparel, shoes, bags; cosmetics and other personal care items; mother and childcare products, toys and instruments; food, beverage and fresh produce; watches, jewelry and luxury goods and office supplies. Each of these categories is further divided into numerous subcategories to facilitate browsing.
 
In building up our product offerings, we focus on quality as well as quantity. Due to our nationwide reach and our efficient fulfillment system, suppliers often choose us as the preferred distributor for a period of a few days or weeks, when they launch new products that they expect will be in high demand.
 
To further expand and develop our business, we made a strategic decision in September, 2018 to provide certain services to other business companies, and we expect such services would increase the profitability of our business more significantly along with other business development and expansion. To provide such services, we plan to first cooperate with a number of other business companies that mainly focus on travel and beauty industries and enable our users to use Lefuyou on purchases made in such business companies.
 
Online Experience
 
We believe that providing a satisfactory online experience is critical to attracting and retaining customers. We make sales primarily through our content-rich and user-friendly mobile application – Lovego App. Our mobile application not only offers a broad selection of authentic products at competitive prices but also provides easy site navigation, basic and advanced search functions, comprehensive product information and a large volume of customer reviews and ratings. These features will likely increase customers’ desire to browse our product offerings, and enable customers to learn more about the products and compare products before making purchases. With the increasing popularity of mobile internet-enabled devices, we have also developed Lovego App that can function on iOS and Android platforms.
Order Fulfilment
 
Delivery
 For our online direct sales, we are responsible for the delivery of products. For supplier consignment sales, suppliers are responsible for the delivery of products. We believe that timely and reliable delivery is critical to the continued success of our business.
 
Our nationwide delivery network has the following features:
 

16

Delivery Network
 We can deliver products to customers in almost all counties and districts across China as of September 30, 2018. We deliver a majority of our orders through SF Express, which is allegedly the fastest and most reliable express delivery company in China. We believe using such reliable courier to deliver our orders fast is helpful to create satisfactory customer experience and can help us stand out from our competitors.
Flexible Delivery Arrangements
 Customers can choose their preferred delivery period during the day when they place orders; in certain regions, customers can also choose evening delivery period at their choice. Customers also have the option to reschedule a delivery by logging into their respective Lovego App account to obtain the contact information of the delivery personnel and make arrangements with such personnel directly by themselves. We believe by offering our customers with flexible delivery arrangements that satisfy their needs is an essential part of customer satisfaction.
Payment
 Various kinds of online payment methods are offered to customers at the time they place their orders, such as Weixin Pay, Alipay among others. Customers chose online payment approximately 90% of the time in 2018.
Marketing
 
We believe that the most effective form of marketing is to continually enhance our customer experience, as customer satisfaction engenders word-of-mouth referrals and repeat purchases. We have been able to build an extensive base of loyal customers primarily through providing superior customer experience and conducting marketing and brand promotion activities.
 
In addition to conducting marketing activities through traditional online and offline channels, we have also designed innovative programs and promotion activities to further enhance the brand awareness of both us and our partners, and to better reach our customers. For instance, we have offered “618 Mid-year Sales,” “Happy Fathers’ Day Selection,” and “6.1 Children’s Day Promotion.” In order to further improve customer experience and increase user engagement on mobile internet, we are exploring cooperation opportunities with many business partners on the mobile side.
 
Unique Business Model (Lefuyou)
 We have developed a unique business model called Lefuyou (a kind of incentive points), under which we give our customers Lefuyou after they place orders with us, except some specific products. Lefuyou rules are as follows:

· | A percentage of sales prices of some products is reserved as Lefuyou which are incentive points to be used in the future.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | 100 Lefuyou can be used as RMB 1 Yuan. 
· | Some products are not entitled to Lefuyou. 
· | Lefuyou cannot be cashed. 
· | Lefuyou can be used as payment for future purchases made with us. 

 
The time needed to process the giving back on an order depends on when we receive profits on an order. In other words, we would like to share our profit with our customers, Lefuyou mode is our comparative advantage to promote customer loyalty and increase our price competitiveness.
 
As part of our marketing strategy, we provide various incentives to our existing customers to increase their spending and loyalty. Our customers can earn reward points upon registration and for each purchase they make, and may exchange the reward points for coupons, gifts and lucky draw opportunities on our platform. Our customers may also earn reward points by introducing new members and customers to our platform. In addition, we encourage our customers to share their successful flash sales shopping experiences through social media and microblogging websites in China. We offer an “easy-to-share” function that enables our customers to easily share their shopping experiences with us on Internet social networking platforms and microblogging websites.
 

17

Pricing
 We offer competitive pricing to attract and retain customers. We make continual efforts to maintain and improve an efficient cost structure and create incentives for our suppliers to provide us with competitive prices.
Pricing Policy
 We are making continual efforts to set our prices to be competitive with those on other major online retail websites and in offline stores in China. We typically negotiate with our suppliers for prices that are comparable to or lower than those offered to retailers in other sales channels. If we reduce the price on our website before the product is delivered to the customer, then the customer generally has an opportunity to lock in the lower price.
Special Promotions
 We offer a selection of discounted products on special occasions, such as the anniversary sales promotional event on June 18 and China’s new online shopping festival on November 11, and on important holidays such as Christmas and Chinese New Year. We also hold regular promotions for selected products for a limited period of time. Special promotions attract bargain hunters and give our customers an additional incentive to visit our website regularly.
Customer Service and Return and Exchange Policies
 
Providing satisfactory customer services is a high priority. Our commitment to customers is reflected in the high service levels provided by our customer service staff as well as in our product return and exchange policies.
 
13-7 Customer service centers
 We operate three 13-7 customer service centers (providing online customer services 7 days a week and 13 hours per day) in Shanghai, handling all kinds of customer queries and complaints regarding our products and services. Customers can make queries and file complaints via various channels such as phone calls, online written instant messengers, and emails.
 
Returns and exchanges policies
 We accept unconditional returns or exchanges within seven days of purchase. Merchandise with defects can be returned for exchange within 15 days of purchase. For customers with good credit, we provide “quick refund” service, that is, the customers are refunded as soon as they submit the return requests. If customers report defects more than 15 days after receipt but still within the warranty period, we will have defective goods repaired or take other appropriate action to compensate the customer, depending on the nature of the issue. We will generally pick up defective items for return or exchange at the customer’s address, provided that the return or exchange is requested within 15 days of receipt of the item and the address is within the area that is serviced by our employees or by one of the third-party couriers that have agreed to provide this service for us. Alternatively, customer can also mail the merchandise to one of our regional fulfillment centers or bring the product to the nearby pickup station. The same policies apply to products sold through our online marketplace.
 
Supply
 
In our online direct sales business, we sourced products from over [287] suppliers in 2018. Procuring products on such a massive scale requires considerable expertise. We negotiate with the manufacturer or a higher-level distributor where possible in order to obtain the most favorable terms, even if we sign a contract with a lower-level distributor for operational reasons.
 
As we increase in scale in particular product categories, we expect to increase our direct purchases from manufacturers and, where appropriate, to become an authorized reseller. We believe that our ability to establish direct relationships with manufacturers will provide improved product pricing and access to hard-to-get products.
 

18

 
We select suppliers on the basis of brand, reliability, volume and price. They must be able to meet our demands for timely supply of authentic products and also provide high quality post-sale customer service. We perform background checks on each supplier and the products it provides before we enter into any agreement. We examine their business licenses and the qualification certificates for their products, and check their brand recognition and make investigation about the market acceptance of their products among players in the same industry. We also conduct on-site visits to assess and verify their location, scale of business, production capacity, property and equipment, human resources, research and development capability, quality control system and fulfillment capability. Our standard form contract requires suppliers to represent that their goods are authentic and from lawful sources and do not infringe upon lawful rights of third parties and to pay us liquidated damages for any breach. We normally enter into one-year framework agreements with our suppliers and renew them annually.
 
Intellectual Property
 
As of March 25, 2019, we held 89 trademark registration certificates and our consolidated affiliated entity, Shenzhen Qianhai Lefu E-Commerce Co., Ltd., or Shenzhen Lefu, a PRC corporation, is the registrant of these trademarks and has the right to use these trademarks. We also hold 1 domain name registration certificate and another consolidated affiliated entity of ours, Shanghai Lefu E-Commerce Co., Ltd., or Shanghai Lefu, a PRC corporation is the registrant of the domain name. There is a Trademark Licensing Agreement between Shanghai Lefu and Shenzhen Lefu, under which Shanghai Lefu is the licensor and Shenzhen Lefu is the licensee of the trademark “Lovego.”
 
It is often difficult to register, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights in China. Statutory laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and enforcement and may not be applied consistently due to the lack of clear guidance on statutory interpretation. Confidentiality, invention assignment and non-compete agreements may be breached by counterparties, and there may not be adequate remedies available to us for any such breach. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights or to enforce our contractual rights in China. Policing any unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly and the steps we take may be inadequate to prevent the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property. In the event that we resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managerial and financial resources, and could put our intellectual property at risk of being invalidated or narrowed in scope. We can provide no assurance that we will prevail in such litigation, and even if we do prevail, we may not obtain a meaningful recovery. Imitation or counterfeiting of our products or other infringement of our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, could diminish the value of our various brands or otherwise adversely affect our net revenues. Any failure in maintaining, protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
Technology
 
Technology is the key to the success of our future business development and the evolution of our ecosystem. Our proprietary technology platform supports our rapidly growing processing capacity requirements, and provides us with detailed and accurate visibility and information based on our comprehensive operating data from value chain.
 
As of March 25, 2019, we employed 9 research and development professionals to design, develop and operate our technology platform.
 
Key components of our technology platform include:
 
Support Different Business Models to Enhance Operating Efficiency
 In addition to supporting traditional e-commerce mode, the platform can also achieve online payment and offline service mode, which is more flexible and more profitable than other traditional e-commerce systems.
 
Provide synchronous shopping App and web mall Lovego
 The synchronous web mall and APP shopping mall can excavate the E-Commerce market potential, to create more chances for Lovego to achieve higher sales revenue further to make more profit.
 

19

 
Independent background, separate transaction
 It takes the form of separate background of buyers and sellers and independent management, so that both buyers and sellers have their own independent login background and can conduct order, payment, settlement and other operations according to their own needs.
 
Our Lovego mobile apps contain the following information and features:
 
Browsing
 All visitors to our platform can browse and view our promotion events, but a customer must register as a member for free in order to participate in the promotion events. Our platform features a variety of different brands and products for each regular promotion events. We sort our product offerings into different categories, such as “women,” “men,” “children,” “outdoors,” “lifestyle,” and “accessories” so that our customers can easily find the products they are interested in.
 
Comprehensive product information
 Each product page contains pictures, descriptions, and sometimes short videos of the product, the price, a pull-down menu to show whether the product is in stock at the customer’s location, customer reviews and ratings, and whether the product will be delivered by us or by one of our third-party sellers. Depending on the type of product, there will be additional information to help the customer make a purchase decision or recommendations to steer the customer towards additional products.
 
Daily Sales Events
 We launch new sales events regularly and typically last for several days. Each sale item is available in limited quantities and remains on sale only while supplies last.
Ordering
 To order products on our platform, our customers simply click on a button to add an item to their virtual shopping cart. To execute orders, customers click on the “check-out” button and are prompted to supply shipping details and payment details in the case of first-time customers buying from our platform. Customers can always access our customer service representatives online or by phone for assistance during service time while they are shopping online or after the order is placed.
 
Real-time order tracking
 Customers can log into their accounts to check the status of their orders. All packages in our system are given a unique identifier and their progress is updated each time they are handled by one of our warehouse or delivery personnel or one of our contracted third-party couriers.
 
Insurance
 
We provide social security insurance including medical insurance, maternity insurance, workplace injury insurance, unemployment insurance and pension benefits through a PRC government-mandated multi-employer defined contribution plan for our employees. We do not maintain business interruption insurance, nor do we maintain product liability insurance or key-man life insurance.
Corporate Social Responsibility
 
We recognize our responsibility to bring improvements to society in which we live and work, and we believe strongly that our core values, including commitment to brands, customers, our employees and broader society are the backbone that drives our decisions to build a healthy and vibrant ecosystem. Combined with an unrelenting focus on developing our technology capabilities to improve efficiency and service, we believe that we have laid the groundwork for many years of robust growth.
 
We are committed to leveraging our technology and relationships with consumers and suppliers to benefit society. We believe in putting our business assets to use to build not only the future of retail, but also a better future for all stakeholders. Our social responsibilities include environment sustainability, employee welfare and benefits, poverty alleviation and more.
 

20

Employee Welfare and Benefits
 We have always striven to provide employees with full social benefits, diversified work environment and a wide range of career development opportunities. As of March 25, 2019, we had a total of 32 full-time employees, and we signed formal contracts with all of our employees and provided them with social benefits. We have invested significant resources in employee career development and training opportunities. For example, we established comprehensive training programs that cover topics such as corporate culture, employee rights and responsibilities, team-building, professional conduct, job performance, management skills, leadership and executive decision-making. We have a special training facility, Lefuhongde School of Chinese Classics, to further strengthen our internal training capabilities.
Regulation
 
Because our operating subsidiaries are located in the PRC, we are regulated by the national and local laws of the PRC.
 
Our business is subject to governmental supervision and regulation by the relevant PRC governmental authorities, including the Ministry of Commerce, China food and drug administration, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or MIIT. Together, these government authorities promulgate and enforce regulations that cover many aspects of the operation of online retailing and distribution of upscale products, including entry into these industries, the scope of permissible business activities, licenses and permits for various business activities, and foreign investment.
 
We are also subject to the PRC’s foreign currency regulations. The PRC government has controlled Renminbi reserves primarily through direct regulation of the conversion of Renminbi into other foreign currencies. Although foreign currencies, which are required for “current account” transactions, can be bought freely at authorized PRC banks, the proper procedural requirements prescribed by PRC law must be met. At the same time, PRC companies are also required to sell their foreign exchange earnings to authorized PRC banks and the purchase of foreign currencies for capital account transactions still requires prior approval of the PRC government.
 
There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of existing or proposed PRC laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that the PRC regulatory authorities would find that our corporate structure and our business operations comply with PRC laws and regulations. If the PRC government finds us to be in violation of PRC laws and regulations, we may be required to pay fines and penalties, obtain certain licenses, approvals, or permits and change, suspend or discontinue our business operations until we comply with applicable laws.
 
Regulations Relating to E-Commerce
 
China’s e-commerce industry is at a relatively early stage of development and there are few PRC laws or regulations specifically regulating the e-commerce industry. In May 2010, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce adopted the Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Commodities Trading and Relevant Services, which took effective in July 2010. Under these measures, enterprises or other operators which engage in online commodities trading and other services and have been registered with the State Administration of Industry and Commerce or its local branches must make the information stated in their business license available to the public or provide a link to their business license on their website. Online distributors must adopt measures to ensure safe online transactions, protect online shoppers’ rights and prevent the sale of counterfeit goods. Information on products and transactions released by online distributors must be authentic, accurate, complete and sufficient.
 
In January 2014, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce promulgated the Administrative Measures for Online Trading, which terminated the above interim measures and became effective in March 2014. The Administrative Measures for Online Trading further strengthen the protection of consumers and impose more stringent requirements and obligations on online business operators and third-party online marketplace operators. For example, online business operators are required to issue invoices to consumers for online products and services. Consumers are generally entitled to return products purchased from online business operators within seven days upon receipt, without giving any reason. Online business operators and third-party online marketplace operators are prohibited from collecting any information on consumers and business operators, or disclosing, selling or providing any such information to any third party, or sending commercial electronic messages to consumers, without their consent. Fictitious transactions, deletion of adverse comments and technical attacks on competitors’ websites are prohibited as well.
 

21

 
In March 2016, the State Administration of Taxation, the Ministry of Finance and the General Administration of Customs jointly issued the Circular on Tax Policy for Cross-Border E-commerce Retail Imports, which took effect in April 2016. Pursuant to this circular, goods imported through the cross-border e-commerce retail are subject to tariff, import value-added tax, or VAT, and consumption tax based on the types of goods. Individuals purchasing any goods imported through cross-border e-commerce retail are taxpayers, and e-commerce companies, companies operating e-commerce transaction platforms or logistic companies are required to withhold the taxes.
 
On August 31, 2018, The E-Commerce Law of the People’s Republic of China has been adopted and issued, and shall come into force as of January 1, 2019. Under this law, more obligations and requirements are imposed to E-commerce platform operators, which means more protections to business operators and consumers. For example, E-commerce platform operators shall adhere to the principles of transparency, fairness and equitableness, formulate platform service agreement and transaction rules, and specify the rights and obligations pertaining to accessing and exiting the platform, quality assurance for goods and services, consumer rights protection, protection of personal information etc. To be specific, unreasonable restrictions or unreasonable conditions shall not be imposed on transactions of the business operators on the platform, nor shall unreasonable fees be collected from those business operators. Furthermore, for goods or services which relate to life and health or consumers, an e-commerce platform operator shall bear the corresponding liability, where it fails to perform the obligation of verifying the qualification of the business operator using the platform, or fails to perform the safety assurance obligation towards consumers, causing consumers to suffer damages.
 
We are subject to these measures as a result of our online direct sales.
 
Regulations Relating to Product Quality and Consumer Protection
 
The Product Quality Law applies to all production and sale activities in China. Pursuant to this law, products offered for sale must satisfy relevant quality and safety standards. Enterprises may not produce or sell counterfeit products in any fashion, including forging brand labels or giving false information regarding a product’s manufacturer. Violations of state or industrial standards for health and safety and any other related violations may result in civil liabilities and administrative penalties, such as compensation for damages, fines, suspension or shutdown of business, as well as confiscation of products illegally produced and sold and the proceeds from such sales. Severe violations may subject the responsible individual or enterprise to criminal liabilities. Where a defective product causes physical injury to a person or damage to another person’s property, the victim may claim compensation from the manufacturer or from the seller of the product. If the seller pays compensation and it is the manufacturer that should bear the liability, the seller has a right of recourse against the manufacturer. Similarly, if the manufacturer pays compensation and it is the seller that should bear the liability, the manufacturer has a right of recourse against the seller.
 
The Consumer Protection Law sets out the obligations of business operators and the rights and interests of the consumers in China. Pursuant to this law, business operators must guarantee that the commodities they sell satisfy the requirements for personal or property safety, provide consumers with authentic information about the commodities, and guarantee the quality, function, usage and term of validity of the commodities. Failure to comply with the Consumer Protection Law may subject business operators to civil liabilities such as refunding purchase prices, replacement of commodities, repairing, ceasing damages, compensation, and restoring reputation, and even subject the business operators or the responsible individuals to criminal penalties when personal damages are involved or if the circumstances are severe. The Consumer Protection Law was further amended in October 2013 and became effective in March 2014. The amended Consumer Protection Law further strengthen the protection of consumers and impose more stringent requirements and obligations on business operators, especially on the business operators through the internet. For example, the consumers are entitled to return the goods (except for certain specific goods, such as custom-made goods, fresh and perishable goods, digital products (e.g. audio-visual products, computer software downloaded online or unpacked by the consumer), newspapers and periodicals delivered and other goods for which non-return of goods is confirmed by the consumer at the time of purchase based on the characteristics of the goods,) within seven days upon receipt without any reasons when they purchase the goods from business operators on the internet. The consumers whose interests have been damaged due to their purchase of goods or acceptance of services on online marketplace platforms may claim damages from sellers or service providers.
 

22

Regulations Relating to Pricing
 
In China, the prices of a very small number of products and services are guided or fixed by the government. According to the Pricing Law, business operators must, as required by the government departments in charge of pricing, mark the prices explicitly and indicate the name, origin of production, specifications, and other related particulars clearly. Business operators may not sell products at a premium or charge any fees that are not explicitly indicated. Business operators must not commit the specified unlawful pricing activities, such as colluding with others to manipulate the market price, using false or misleading prices to deceive consumers to transact, or conducting price discrimination against other business operators. Failure to comply with the Pricing Law may subject business operators to administrative sanctions such as warning, ceasing unlawful activities, compensation, confiscating illegal gains, fines. The business operators may be ordered to suspend business for rectification, or have their business licenses revoked if the circumstances are severe. We are subject to the Pricing Law as an online retailer and believe that our pricing activities are currently in compliance with the law in all material aspects.
Regulations Relating to Employment
 
The Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules provide requirements concerning employment contracts between an employer and its employees. If an employer fails to enter into a written employment contract with an employee within one year from the date on which the employment relationship is established, the employer must rectify the situation by entering into a written employment contract with the employee and pay the employee twice the employee’s salary for the period from the day following the lapse of one month from the date of establishment of the employment relationship to the day prior to the execution of the written employment contract. The Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules also require compensation to be paid upon certain terminations, which significantly affects the cost of reducing workforce for employers. In addition, if an employer intends to enforce a non-compete provision with an employee in an employment contract or non-competition agreement, it has to compensate the employee on a monthly basis during the term of the restriction period after the termination or ending of the labor contract. Employers in most cases are also required to provide a severance payment to their employees after their employment relationships are terminated.
 
Enterprises in China are required by PRC laws and regulations to participate in certain employee benefit plans, including social insurance funds, namely a pension plan, a medical insurance plan, an unemployment insurance plan, a work-related injury insurance plan and a maternity insurance plan, and a housing provident fund, and contribute to the plans or funds in amounts equal to certain percentages of salaries, including bonuses and allowances, of the employees as specified by the local government from time to time at locations where they operate their businesses or where they are located. According to the Social Insurance Law, an employer that fails to make social insurance contributions may be ordered to pay the required contributions within a stipulated deadline and be subject to a late fee. If the employer still fails to rectify the failure to make social insurance contributions within the stipulated deadline, it may be subject to a fine ranging from one to three times the amount overdue. According to the Regulations on Management of Housing Fund, an enterprise that fails to make housing fund contributions may be ordered to rectify the noncompliance and pay the required contributions within a stipulated deadline; otherwise, an application may be made to a local court for compulsory enforcement.
