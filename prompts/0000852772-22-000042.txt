Item 1.     Business
Description of Business

Denny’s Corporation (Denny’s), a Delaware corporation, is one of America’s largest franchised full-service restaurant chains. Denny’s, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Denny’s, Inc., owns and operates the Denny’s brand. As of December 29, 2021, the Denny’s brand consisted of 1,640 franchised, licensed and company restaurants around the world, including 1,487 restaurants in the United States and 153 international restaurant locations. As of December 29, 2021, 1,575 of our restaurants were franchised or licensed, representing 96% of the total restaurants, and 65 were company restaurants.
Denny’s is known as America’s Diner, or in the case of our international locations, “the local diner.” Open 24/7 in most locations, we provide our guests quality food that emphasizes everyday value and new and innovative products through our compelling limited time only offerings, delivered in a warm, friendly “come as you are” atmosphere. Denny’s has been serving guests for over 65 years and is best known for its breakfast fare, which is available around the clock. The Build Your Own Grand Slam, one of our most popular menu items, traces its origin back to the Original Grand Slam which was first introduced in 1977. In addition to our breakfast-all-day items, Denny’s offers a wide selection of lunch and dinner items including burgers, sandwiches, salads and knife and fork entrées, along with an assortment of beverages, appetizers and desserts. We have four dayparts, breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night, accounting for 28%, 37%, 22% and 13%, respectively, of average daily sales. Weekends have traditionally been the most popular time for guests to visit our restaurants. In 2021, 36% of an average week of sales occurred from Friday late night through Sunday lunch. Additionally, off-premise sales, including sales for delivery and through our two virtual brands, have grown during the pandemic and represented approximately 27% of total sales in 2021.
References to “Denny’s,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in this Form 10-K are references to Denny’s Corporation and its subsidiaries. Financial information about our operations, including our revenues and net income (loss) for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2021, December 30, 2020, and December 25, 2019, and our total assets as of December 29, 2021 and December 30, 2020, is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
COVID-19 Pandemic
In 2020 and continuing through 2021, the global crisis resulting from the spread of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”), along with government and consumer responses to the pandemic, had, and continue to have, an impact on our restaurant operations. During 2020, many of our company and franchised and licensed restaurants were temporarily closed and most of the restaurants that remained open had limited operations. While we experienced improving sales performance in 2021, many restaurants have not returned to full operating hours, particularly at the late night daypart. Our operating results substantially depend upon the sales volumes, restaurant profitability, and financial stability of our company and franchised and licensed restaurants.
As a result of recent increases in COVID-19 cases due to unforeseen variants, we cannot currently estimate the duration or future negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. See “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results.
Franchising and Development
Franchising 

Our criteria to become a Denny’s franchisee include minimum liquidity and net worth requirements and appropriate operational experience. We believe that Denny’s is an attractive financial proposition for current and potential franchisees and that our fee structure is competitive with other full-service brands. Our current traditional twenty-year Denny’s franchise agreements have an initial fee of up to $30,000 and a royalty payment of up to 4.5% of gross sales. Additionally, our franchisees are required to contribute up to 3.25% of gross sales for marketing and may make additional advertising contributions as part of a local marketing co-operative. Approximately 80% of our franchised restaurants were operating under this traditional agreement as of December 29, 2021. License agreements for nontraditional locations, such as university campuses, may contain higher royalty and lower advertising contribution rates than the traditional franchise agreements. Our domestic contractual royalty rate averaged approximately 4.35% during 2021.
We work closely with our franchisees to plan and execute many aspects of the business. The Denny’s Franchisee Association (“DFA”) was created to promote communication among our franchisees and between the Company and our franchise community. Members of the DFA’s board and Company management primarily work together through Brand Advisory Councils relating to Development, Marketing, Operations and Technology matters, as well as through a Supply Chain Oversight Committee for procurement and distribution matters.
Site Selection
The success of any restaurant is significantly influenced by its location. Our development team works closely with franchisees and real estate brokers to identify sites that meet specific standards. Sites are evaluated based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
•demographics;
•traffic patterns;
•visibility;
•building constraints;
•competition;
•environmental restrictions; and
•proximity to high-traffic consumer activities.
Domestic Development

To accelerate the growth of the brand in specific under-penetrated markets, we offer certain incentive programs. These programs provide incentives for franchisees to develop locations in areas where Denny’s has opportunities to grow market share. The benefits to franchisees can include reduced franchise fees, upfront cash payments, lower royalties and advertising contributions for a limited time period and credits toward certain development services, such as training fees.
In addition to these incentive programs, we increased our domestic development commitments through our refranchising and development strategy implemented during 2018 and 2019. These commitments were attached to the sale of 113 company restaurants during 2018 and 2019. At December 29, 2021, we had approximately 92 domestic development commitments.
International Development 

In addition to the development agreements signed for domestic restaurants, as of December 29, 2021, we had potential to develop approximately 126 international franchised restaurants with our current development partners in various locations including Canada, Central America, Curacao, Indonesia, Mexico, the Middle East, the Philippines and the United Kingdom. The majority of these restaurants are expected to open over the next ten years. During 2021, we opened eight international franchised locations, including five in Canada and one each in Guatemala, Mexico and the Philippines.
While we anticipate the majority of the restaurants related to various domestic and international development agreements will be opened generally as scheduled, from time to time some of our franchisees’ ability to grow and meet their development commitments may be hampered by the economy, the lending environment or other circumstances. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have deferred most of our domestic and international development commitments for one year from their original due date.
Franchise Focused Business Model
Through our development and refranchising efforts during 2018 and 2019, we have achieved a restaurant portfolio mix of 96% franchised and 4% company restaurants. We expect the majority of our future restaurant openings and growth of the brand to come primarily from the development of franchised restaurants. The following table summarizes the changes in the number of company restaurants and franchised and licensed restaurants during the past five years (excluding relocations): 

 | 2021 | 2020 | | 2019 | 2018 | 2017

The table below sets forth information regarding the distribution of single-store and multi-store franchisees as of December 29, 2021:

Number of Restaurants Owned | Franchisees | Percentage of Franchisees | | Restaurants | Percentage of Restaurants
One | 81 | | 36.2 | % | 81 | 5.1 | %
Two to five | 77 | | 34.4 | % | 229 | 14.5 | %
Six to ten | 29 | | 12.9 | % | 231 | 14.7 | %
Eleven to fifteen | 15 | | 6.7 | % | 182 | 11.6 | %

Total | 224 | | 100.0 | % | 1,575 | 100.0 | %

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have increased communications with our DFA board and our franchisees to better understand and respond to the needs of our franchisees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, direct financial relief to Denny’s franchise partners has included: 
•deferral of remodels until 2022, and deferral of most of our domestic development commitments for one year from their original due date; 
•deferral of royalty and advertising fees for week 11 of the 2020 fiscal year; 
•abatement of royalty and advertising fees for weeks 12 and 13 of the 2020 fiscal year; 
•additional royalty abatements in the second fiscal quarter of 2020; 
•royalty incentive for those restaurants open during the late night daypart in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020; and
•a 12-week lease deferral in fiscal 2020 for franchisees operating in properties owned by the Company. 
In addition, during 2020, the Company secured rent relief in the form of deferrals for over 78% of the leases in which the Company is a lessee, including those instances in which the Company subleases to franchisees and has passed the same relief on to the franchisees. Furthermore, the Company worked closely with key vendors and primary third-party franchise lenders to help secure additional relief on behalf of franchisees. Substantially all of Denny’s franchisees successfully pursued available forms of relief under federal stimulus programs. As of December 29, 2021 and December 30, 2020, trade accounts receivable from franchisees included $0.6 million and $5.7 million, respectively, of amounts related to the week 11 fee deferrals and the 12-week lease deferrals that occurred in fiscal 2020.
Restaurant Operations
Management & Operations

We believe that the consistent and reliable execution of basic restaurant operations in each Denny’s restaurant, whether it is company or franchised, is critical to our success. We require both our company and franchised restaurants to maintain the same strict brand standards. These standards are, and have been, critical to the brand’s success. They include best in class quality and preparation of food, meeting and exceeding our guests’ expectations and providing a family friendly experience at each restaurant.
The staff for a typical restaurant consists of one General Manager, two or three Restaurant Managers and approximately 45 hourly employees. The Chief Operating Officer, along with the two Vice Presidents of Franchise Operations, a Senior Director of Franchise Operations, the Vice President of Learning and Development, the Vice President of Operations Services and the Senior Director of Company Operations, establish the strategic direction and key initiatives for the Operations Teams. We seek to ensure that our company restaurants meet our high standards through a network of Company District Managers and restaurant level managers, overseen by our Senior Director of Company Operations. A network of Regional Directors of Franchise Operations and Franchise Business Coaches provide oversight of our franchised restaurants to ensure compliance with brand standards, promote operational excellence and provide general support to our franchisees. The duties of the Directors of Operations, District Managers and Franchise Business Coaches include regular restaurant visits and inspections, as well as frequent interactions with our franchisees, employees and guests, which ensure the ongoing adherence to our standards of quality, service, cleanliness, value and hospitality.
Denny’s maintains training programs for hourly employees and restaurant management. Hourly employee training programs (including online learning) are position-specific and focus on skills necessary to successfully fulfill the responsibilities assigned to them, while continually enhancing guest satisfaction. Denny’s Manager In Training (“MIT”) program provides managers with the knowledge and leadership skills needed to successfully operate a Denny’s restaurant. The MIT program is required for all new managers of company restaurants and is also available to Denny’s franchisees to train their managers. 
Brand Protection, Quality & Regulatory Compliance
We pride ourself in serving our guests food that is safe, wholesome and meets our quality standards. Our systems are based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) principles. To ensure this basic expectation of our guests, Denny’s also has systems in place that require solely the use of approved vendors and distributors which can meet and follow our product specifications and food handling procedures. Vendors, distributors and restaurant employees follow regulatory requirements (federal, state and local), industry “best practices” and Denny’s Brand Standards.
Human Capital

Human capital management considerations are at the core of Our Guiding Principles, the drivers of which include leveraging our culture of belonging and the capability of our people to fuel brand performance and franchise success, as well as recruiting and equipping the best restaurant operators in the world to deliver great customer experiences. Our commitments and progress towards executing this strategy are reflected below.
Be Well
We focus on the whole person. 
We offer comprehensive benefits that support our team members and their families’ overall well-being. Denny’s also contributes to programs that provide our team members with financial security, now and in the future. We offer a robust set of benefits and rewards that focus on recognition, career building, health and wellness, time-off benefits, and other perks that are designed to make our peoples’ experience as a Denny’s team member productive and fun. We assess our culture and listen to our workforce through periodic employee engagement surveys. Numerous policy changes have been made or been influenced by the feedback we receive from our employees. 
We are proud to offer an Employee Assistance Program to all employees and family members. This confidential program is available 24/7 for personal or professional consultations. In addition, we provide our employees with access to a 401(k) savings plan, tuition reimbursement, life insurance options, and a competitive vacation policy. Our compensation and performance evaluation systems are carefully designed to maintain pay equity by focusing pay decisions on experience and performance to 
ensure the Company retains a highly productive workforce to operate our business while providing a high level of service to our guests. 
Learning and Development
At Denny's, we invest in team members’ success through education and training. Our Breakthrough Leadership Training and Development program provides Denny's team members with exclusive access to numerous creative and interactive employee engagement curricula, leadership workshops, simulations, mobile learning and educational training videos. This unique program helps develop a wide range of skills, including leadership, people management, guest service, inventory management, food preparation and food safety—skills that help workers successfully operate in the restaurant industry.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
Our investment in people includes creating a culture of belonging that attracts, retains and fosters the growth of the best people and creates high performance in our restaurants. We value and are proud of our community engagement including our investment in causes that are important to our people and communities, such as our education initiatives through our Denny’s Hungry for EducationTM Scholarship program, helping fight childhood hunger, and supporting diverse and disadvantaged businesses.
Additional components of our strategic areas of focus include:
Business Resource Leadership Groups
We have established six business resource leadership groups for Denny's employees to provide encouragement and an enhanced sense of belonging through informal mentoring, participation in professional and community events and access to personal and professional development and growth opportunities. Additionally, they help foster a more inclusive work environment, improve communication and trust among employees and enhance understanding of all employees about the value of diversity. The six business resource groups include the African American Leadership Group, Emerging Leaders Group, Hispanic Leadership Group, LGBTQ Leadership Group, Veterans Leadership Group, and Women’s Leadership Group. 
Diversity Council
Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) Council collaborates on initiatives designed to renew our workplace and create business results that will increase and strengthen our brand reputation, guest satisfaction and market share. The council consists of 19 cross-functional members representing various positions throughout the Denny's organization, who serve as ambassadors, bridge builders, data collectors, educators, accountability partners and champions of DEI within the Denny's brand.
Diversity by the Numbers
Diverse team members make up approximately:
•75% of Denny’s total workforce and 80% of restaurant management
•58% of our restaurants are owned by diverse franchisees
◦Of the 58%, 24% are owned by women who are actively engaged in the business
•Our Board of Directors consist of nine directors – 56% are from a diverse background and 44% are women
•6% of our total restaurants are owned by members of the LGBTQ community
We believe in accountability that starts with our leadership and extends to all of our team members. Our Chief Executive Officer, John Miller, has taken the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge. At Denny’s we have a world class DEI philosophy embraced by our workforce and we commit to support other companies in doing the same. 
As of December 29, 2021, we had approximately 3,300 employees of whom approximately 3,000 were employees of our company-owned restaurants and approximately 300 were corporate employees at our restaurant support centers or in the field.
Product Development and Marketing
The Denny’s name has been associated with high-quality, reasonably priced food, appetizers and beverages which have appealed to guests across all generations for nearly 70 years. As a leading full-service family dining brand, we’ve developed a craveable, indulgent menu that forges brand loyalty, attracts new guests to Denny’s and establishes the framework for our primary marketing strategies.
Menu Offerings
As “America’s Diner,” Denny’s has created a menu that offers a large selection of craveable, indulgent products served in a friendly and welcoming atmosphere for all guests. We offer a wide variety of entrées for breakfast, lunch, dinner and late-night dining as well as appetizers, desserts and beverages. Most Denny’s restaurants also offer special menu items for children and seniors at reduced prices. We consistently optimize our product offering to further align with consumer needs, which includes enhancing our core “breakfast all day” platform while providing everyday affordability, abundant value menu items, such as Super Slam, and delivering compelling core menu and limited-time-only products. Our menu items are conveniently enjoyed by guests either in our restaurants, via pick-up, curb-side delivery or delivery through our Denny’s on Demand platform and third-party delivery providers.
Denny’s on Demand is our internal digital ordering platform that provides guests with a personalized experience by enabling them to order whatever they want, whenever they want. Guests simply have to log onto the new Denny’s mobile app or online for takeout or delivery to wherever they want to enjoy their favorite Denny’s items. Our new mobile app also grants Denny’s Rewards members access to their digital wallets to receive rewards and promotions, both in-restaurant and online.
Product Development

Denny’s is a consumer-driven brand focusing on hospitality, menu choices and the overall guest experience. Our Product Development team innovates menu items that delight our guests during each visit. This team works to understand the most up-to-date trends through consumer insights from primary and secondary qualitative and quantitative studies and ideas from our franchisees, vendors and operators. These insights come together to form the strategic foundation for menu architecture, pricing, promotion and advertising. 
Our guests are the center of all menu innovations at Denny’s. Before introducing a new menu item to market, we rigorously test it against consumer expectations, standards of culinary discipline, food science and technology, nutritional analysis, financial benefit and operational execution. This testing process ensures that new menu items are not only appealing, competitive, profitable and marketable, but can be prepared and delivered with excellence in our restaurants.
We continually evolve our menu through new innovations and improvements to meet the needs of ever-changing consumer and marketplace.
Product Sources and Availability

Most food products, paper and packaging supplies, and equipment used in company and franchised restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurants by third-party distribution companies. Our centralized purchasing program is designed to ensure uniform product quality as well as to minimize food, beverage and supply costs. The size of our brand provides significant purchasing power, which often enables us to obtain products at favorable prices from nationally recognized suppliers.
In the U.S., the majority of such products are purchased and distributed through McLane Company, Inc. under a long-term distribution contract. Outside the U.S., we and our International franchisees primarily use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global, regional and local suppliers and distributors. Our international franchisees generally select and manage their own third-party suppliers and distributors, subject to our internal standards. All suppliers and distributors are expected to provide products and/or services that comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in the state and/or country in which they operate as well as comply with our internal standards.
We believe that satisfactory alternative sources of supplies are generally available for all of the items regularly used by our restaurants. We have not experienced any material shortages of food, equipment, or other products which are necessary to our restaurant operations.
Marketing and Advertising

We deploy national, local and co-operative marketing strategies to promote and amplify Denny’s brand strengths as “America’s Diner.” Through integrated marketing strategies, we promote our various breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late-night menu offerings and premium limited-time-only offerings as well as the convenience of online ordering and payment for pick up or delivery. 
Through our Marketing team, Denny’s anticipates consumer and market trends and fully leverages consumer insights to determine strategies for brand communication and demand generation. We participate in comprehensive, integrated marketing activities, including print, broadcast, radio, digital and social advertising; multicultural marketing; public relations and brand reputation; customer relationship management, field marketing; and national and local promotions.
Information Technology
The mission of our Information Technology department is to align our technology strategy in support of our business strategies. We focus on leveraging technology to drive efficiencies, simplify and standardize operations, and streamline the guest experience. We also deliver solutions that support financial and regulatory needs in addition to necessary business improvements. 
We rely on information technology systems in all aspects of our operations. At the restaurant level, systems include point-of-sale platforms along with systems and tools for kitchen operations, labor scheduling, inventory management, cash management and credit card transaction processing. Our technology platform includes industry-standard market solutions as well as proprietary software and integration, yielding tools and information managers need to run efficient and effective restaurants. We invest in new technologies and R&D efforts to improve operations and enhance the guest experience through innovative solutions like online ordering and payment for pick-up and delivery.
At the corporate level, we have a robust Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) platform that supports finance, accounting, human resources and payroll functions. Our ERP is a cloud-based market solution, enabling us to take advantage of continual software improvements aligned with industry best practices. We also have and are continuing to develop systems that consolidate and report on data from our franchised and company restaurants, including transaction-level detail. These systems are collectively supported by an enterprise network that facilitates seamless connectivity for applications and data throughout our business infrastructure. 
Our information technology systems have been designed to protect against unauthorized access and data loss. We are continuously focused on enhancing our cybersecurity capabilities. We are required to maintain the highest level of Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standard (“DSS”) compliance. We are also required to protect critical and sensitive data for our employees, customers, and the Company. These standards are set by a consortium of major credit card companies and require certain levels of system security and procedures to protect our customers’ credit card and other personal information. We have deployed payment technologies that are Europay, Mastercard, Visa (“EMV”) certified, and we employ point-to-point encryption to ensure no credit card data is stored within our restaurants. Further, we monitor franchisees’ compliance with PCI standards.  
In 2020, as a direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on our business and industry, we augmented our technology infrastructure, primarily within digital and in-restaurant systems. These enhancements were introduced through our standard change control mechanisms and followed prescribed standards for testing and introduction into our environment. There were no material changes introduced into the core of our technology operating systems, and all PCI—DSS compliance standards were followed.
In addition to technology changes in direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we benefited from our prior focus and investments in various technology platforms over the past few years. These investments include our ERP platform and enterprise communication and collaboration tools, which prepared us to make a quick transition from a centralized to a remote workforce with no significant additional risk or negative impact to business processing and continuity.
See “Risk Factors” for further information regarding Information Technology. 
Seasonality

Restaurant sales are generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters (April through September) than in the fourth and first calendar quarters (October through March). Additionally, severe weather, storms and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions.
Trademarks and Service Marks

Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we have certain trademarks and service marks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in international jurisdictions, including “Denny’s®,” “Grand Slam®,” and “$2 $4 $6 $8 Value Menu®.” We consider our trademarks and service marks important to the identification of our company and franchised restaurants and believe they are of material importance to the conduct of our business. In addition, we have registered various domain names on the internet that incorporate certain of our trademarks and service marks. We believe these domain name registrations are an integral part of our identity. From time to time, we may resort to legal measures to defend and protect the use of our intellectual property. Generally, with appropriate renewal and use, the registration of our service marks and trademarks will continue indefinitely.
Competition

The restaurant industry is highly competitive. Restaurants compete on the basis of name recognition and advertising; the price, quality, variety and perceived value of their food offerings; the quality and speed of their guest service; the location and attractiveness of their facilities; and the convenience of to-go ordering and delivery options.

Denny’s direct competition in the full-service category includes a collection of national and regional chains, as well as thousands of independent operators. We also compete with quick service restaurants as they attempt to upgrade their menus with premium sandwiches, entrée salads, new breakfast offerings and extended hours as well as grocery store chains as they enhance their ready-to-eat offerings to consumers.

We believe that Denny’s has a number of competitive strengths, including strong brand recognition, well-located restaurants and market penetration. We benefit from economies of scale in a variety of areas, including advertising, purchasing and distribution. Additionally, we believe that Denny’s has competitive strengths in the value, variety and quality of our food products, and in the quality and training of our employees. See “Risk Factors” for additional factors relating to our competition in the restaurant industry.

Economic, Market and Other Conditions

The restaurant industry is affected by many factors, including changes in national, regional and local economic conditions affecting consumer spending; the political environment (including acts of war and terrorism); changes in customer travel patterns including changes in the price of gasoline; changes in socio-demographic characteristics of areas where restaurants are located; changes in consumer tastes and preferences; food safety and health concerns; outbreaks of flu or other viruses (such as the coronavirus) or other diseases; increases in the number of restaurants; and unfavorable trends affecting restaurant operations, such as rising wage rates, health care costs, utility expenses and unfavorable weather. See “Risk Factors” for additional information.
Government Regulations

We and our franchisees are subject to local, state, federal and international laws and regulations governing various aspects of the restaurant business, such as compliance with various minimum wage, overtime, health care, sanitation, food safety, citizenship, and fair labor standards, as well as laws and regulations relating to sanitation, safety, fire, zoning, building, consumer protection and taxation. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and international laws governing franchise sales and the franchise relationship, as well as judicial and administrative interpretations of such laws. 
Following the World Health Organization’s declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020, federal, state and local governments responded by implementing restrictions on travel, “stay at home” directives, “social distancing” guidance, limitations of dine-in food service, and mandated dining room closures which collectively had a significant adverse impact on the Company’s business performance, results of operations and cash flows for the years ended December 29, 2021 and December 30, 2020. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a more detailed discussion.
The operation of our franchisee system is also subject to regulations enacted by a number of states and rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission. Such regulations impose registration and disclosure requirements on franchisors in the offer and sale of franchises and may also apply substantive standards to the relationship between franchisor and franchisee, including limitations on the ability of franchisors to terminate franchises and alter franchise arrangements. Due to our international franchising, we are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our 
international franchisees. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
We are subject to certain guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and various state codes and regulations, which require restaurants and our brand to provide full and equal access to persons with physical disabilities.
Our collection or use of personal information about our employees or our guests is regulated at the federal and state levels, including the California Consumer Privacy Act.
We are also subject to regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages, which require licensure by each site (in most cases, on an annual basis). Such licenses generally may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. These regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.
We are subject to anti-corruption laws in the United States and in the international jurisdictions where we do business, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We are also subject to a variety of international laws relating to franchising and licensing of intellectual property in the various countries across the world where we are engaged in franchising our restaurant brands.
We believe we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot predict the effect on operations of the enactment of additional regulations in the future.
We have implemented various aspects of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act. However, the law or other related requirements may change. 
See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks related to governmental regulation of our business.
