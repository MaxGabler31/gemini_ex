ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview

We are focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary sensor technologies which, when paired with our artificial intelligence, or AI, deep learning platform, are capable of uniquely identifying and measuring almost any material or analyte using electromagnetic energy to detect, record, identify and measure the unique “signature” of said materials or analytes. We call this our “Bio-RFID” technology platform, when pertaining to radio and microwave spectroscopy, and our “ChromaID” technology platform, when pertaining to optical spectroscopy. The data obtained with our sensor technology is analyzed with our trade secret algorithms which are driven by our AI deep learning platform.

ChromaID was the first technology developed and patented by our company. For the past several years, we have focused on extensions and new patentable inventions that are derived from and extend beyond our ChromaID technology and intellectual property. The rapid advances made with our Bio-RFID technology in our laboratory have caused us to move quickly into the commercialization phase of our company as we work to create revenue generating products for the marketplace. Today, the primary focus of our company is on our Bio-RFID technology and our commercialization and development of related patent assets. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we work to exploit additional opportunities and markets that our broad intellectual property and trade secret portfolio addresses.

Corporate History and Structure

Know Labs, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 1998. Since 2007, our company has been focused primarily on research and development of proprietary spectroscopic technologies spanning the electromagnetic spectrum. 

On April 30, 2020, we incorporated Particle, Inc., or Particle, as a wholly-owned subsidiary in the State of Nevada. Particle focused on the development and commercialization of our extensive intellectual property relating to electromagnetic energy outside of the medical diagnostic arena which remains the parent company’s singular focus. 

On September 17, 2021, we incorporated of AI Mind, Inc., or AI Mind, as a wholly-owned subsidiary in the State of Nevada. AI Mind is focused on monetizing the AI deep learning platform. 

The Know Labs Technology

We have internally and under contract with third parties developed proprietary platform technologies to uniquely identify and measure almost any organic and inorganic material or analyte. Our patented technology utilizes electromagnetic energy along a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from visible light and infrared to radio and microwave wavelengths to perform analytics which allow the user to accurately identify and measure materials and analytes depending upon the specified targets or endpoints and field of use. Our proprietary platform technologies are called Bio-RFID and ChromaID.

Our technology platform, Bio-RFID, utilizes spectroscopy at higher wavelengths than ChromaID’s optical range to span radio wave and microwave segments of the electromagnetic spectrum. Working in our lab we have developed extensions and new inventions derived in part from our ChromaID technology, which we refer to as Bio-RFID. We believe an important competitive differentiator for Bio-RFID to be its ability to not only identify a wide range of organic and inorganic materials and analytes, but to do so concurrently, and in real time, which potentially enables new multivariate models of clinical diagnostics, and health and wellness monitoring. We are rapidly advancing the development of this technology by increasing its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. We have announced detailed results confirming that we have successfully been able to non-invasively measure blood glucose levels in humans. Significantly, we believe Bio-RFID successfully addresses  the limiting qualities of optical technologies whose diagnostic capacities may be inhibited by skin tones, skin thickness and other factors.

Our ability to obtain exacting results from the data obtained from our Bio-RFID sensor technology, also referred to as radio frequency spectroscopy or RF spectroscopy, is a consequence of the application of our trade secret algorithms. We have worked for the last several years on the AI and machine learning, or ML, that drives the accurate pattern recognition of our algorithms. This work has led to the development of a robust AI deep learning platform. This AI deep learning platform drives the data pattern recognition for Bio-RFID’s exacting determination of blood glucose levels.  It can also provide the data recognition for blood alcohol and blood oxygen levels which we have also identified in preliminary tests.  It will provide the analytics for the long list of other analytes in the human body that we will pursue non-invasive detection of, many of which are set forth in our issued patent USPTO 11,033,208 B1. Our AI deep learning platform may be separately monetized through our subsidiary AI Mind.

We continue to build the internal and external development team necessary to commercialize our technology as well as make additional patent filings covering the intellectual property created with new inventions. The first applications of our Bio-RFID technology will be in a product marketed as a glucose monitor. It will provide the user with real time information on their blood glucose levels. This product will require US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, clearance prior to its introduction to the market, which we plan to pursue. We have previously announced two versions of our non-invasive glucose monitoring device.  We have identified these as the KnowU and the UBand. The KnowU will be a desk top version with a portable monitoring device for periodic glucose monitoring and the UBand will be a wearable for continuous glucose monitoring.

We have also announced the results of internal laboratory-based comparison testing between our Bio-RFID technology and the leading continuous glucose monitors from Abbott Labs (Freestyle Libre) and DexCom (G6).  These results provide evidence of a high degree of correlation between our Bio-RFID technology and the current industry leaders and their continuous glucose monitors. Our patented technology is fundamentally differentiated from these industry leaders as our technology completely non-invasively monitors blood glucose levels.

We have begun the internal process to pursue FDA approval of our non-invasive blood glucose monitoring device as soon as possible. To guide us in that undertaking, we previously announced the hiring of a Chief Medical Officer and formed a medical and regulatory advisory board to guide us through the FDA process. Additionally, we have retained third party quality assurance and documentation consultants to ensure that the rigorous requirements of the FDA are met. We are unable, however, to estimate the time necessary for FDA approval or the likelihood of success in that endeavor.

While the first focus of our Bio-RFID platform is non-invasive glucose monitoring, it is important to note that our KnowU and the UBand devices have the capacity to monitor and identify other analytes in the human body with a relatively simple software modification. Each additional analyte we identify over time will require its own subsequent FDA approval, the success of which we are unable to estimate at this time.

Our ChromaID patented technology utilizes light at the photon (elementary particle of light) level through a series of emitters and detectors to generate a unique signature or “fingerprint” from a scan of almost any solid, liquid or gaseous material. This signature of reflected or transmitted light is digitized, creating a unique ChromaID signature. Each ChromaID signature is comprised of hundreds to thousands of specific data points. 

The ChromaID technology looks beyond visible light frequencies to areas of near infra-red and ultraviolet light and beyond that are outside the humanly visible light spectrum. The data obtained allows us to create a very specific and unique ChromaID signature of the substance for a myriad of authentication, verification, and identification applications. 

Bio-RFID, ChromaID and AI Deep Learning: Foundational Platform Technologies

Our technologies provide a unique platform upon which a myriad of applications can be developed. As platform technologies, they are analogous to a smartphone, upon which an enormous number of previously unforeseen applications have been developed. Bio-RFID and ChromaID technologies are “enabling” technologies that bring the science of electromagnetic energy to low-cost, real-world commercialization opportunities across multiple industries. The technologies are foundational and, as such, the basis upon which we believe significant businesses can be built. While we are pursuing our core focus on commercializing our glucose monitor, we believe non-core clinical and non-clinical applications represent a multitude of opportunities for strategic collaboration, joint development and licensing agreements with leading companies in their respective industries.

As with other foundational technologies, a single application may reach across multiple industries. Bio-RFID technology can non-invasively identify and monitor changes in the  quantity of blood glucose in the human body. By extension, there may be other analytes or molecular structures this same technology can identify in the human body which, over time, we intend to focus on. They may include the monitoring of drug usage or the presence of illicit drugs. They may also involve identifying hormones and various biomarkers of disease or pre-conditions of disease.

Similarly, ChromaID technology can, for example, effectively differentiate and identify different brands of clear vodkas that appear identical to the human eye. By extension, this same technology could identify pure water from water with contaminants present. It could provide real time detection of liquid medicines such as morphine that have been adulterated or compromised. It could detect if jet fuel has water contamination present. It could determine when it is time to change oil in a deep fat fryer. These are but a few of the potential applications of ChromaID technology based upon extensions of its ability to identify different liquids.

The AI deep learning platform is an enabling technology which can identify patterns from data gathered from both the Bio-RFID and ChromaID platform technologies. The AI deep learning platform is critical to our ability to identify accurately blood glucose levels and other analytes in the human body. Over time, utilizing our AI deep learning platform, we plan to develop analytics which, when using data collected from our sensors, will provide useful information on health and wellness to end users, and potentially lead to what we call “Predictive Health.”  In addition to identifying patterns, the inverse is also possible as our AI deep learning platform can also create patterns in the form of 3D graphical images.  That activity has found its first form in the work of our subsidiary, AI Mind, to generate beautiful 3D graphical images which were sold as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, providing revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. NFT sales from images created by our AI deep learning platform were the result of a one-time successful experiment.  We do not expect future activity or revenue from that source. 

Product Strategy 

We are currently undertaking internal development work on potential products for the commercial marketplace. We have announced the development of our non-invasive glucose monitor and our desire to obtain FDA clearance for the marketing of this product. We have also announced the engagement of a manufacturing partner we will work with to bring this product to market. We will make further announcements regarding this product as development, testing, manufacturing, and regulatory approval work progresses.

Currently, we are focusing our efforts on productizing our Bio-RFID technology as we move it out of our research laboratory, through third party validation studies, appropriate and required clinical trials and into the marketplace. At this point in our development cycle the sensor hardware is completed, the product form factor is nearing completion, and the algorithms which provide accurate results from the data collected by our sensor are in the final development stages.

Our subsidiary, Particle, continues to seek a strategic distribution partner or partners to move its virus deactivating light bulb into the global marketplace.  Our subsidiary, AI Mind, will, over time, look at additional ways to monetize our AI deep learning platform. 

Sales and Marketing

While we continue with our internal development efforts and the move toward FDA approved clinical trials and expected (but not guaranteed) clearance of our first product, a non-invasive blood glucose monitoring device, we will explore the several potential avenues for moving our first product and potential follow on products into the marketplace.  The avenues being explored include direct to consumer, initial launch partners, broad distribution partners, licensing partners and private label approaches to the market among others.  We have begun to build our internal sales and marketing team in preparation for detailed strategic thinking about the optimal approach to the marketplace. 
Competition

We group the competition into three large categories. Those are (i) large global technology companies who may enter the blood glucose monitoring and other medical diagnostic markets, (ii) legacy providers of blood glucose monitoring technology, and (iii) new entrants working to achieve a non-invasive solution or more acceptable blood glucose monitoring solution which may or may not be similar to our technology. With regard to companies in each category, we perform due diligence from all publicly available sources of information on their relevant technologies and their product plans. This information informs and refines our activities and underscores our sense of urgency as we work to bring our own technology to the marketplace. The addressable market is very large and there is room for a multitude of providers of blood glucose monitoring services. Of note, we believe few, if any, of the competitors in the blood glucose monitoring space possess a platform technology competitive with our Bio-RFID technology and our ability to identify a multitude of analytes in the human body.

Competitive Advantages

We believe our key competitive strengths include:


· | Through first principles, Bio-RFID’s ability to not only identify a wide range of organic and inorganic materials and analytes, but to do so concurrently, and in real time, which potentially enables new multivariate models of clinical diagnostics, and health and wellness monitoring.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Our Bio-RFID technology is non-invasive, using radio waves to identify and measure what is going on inside the body in real-time 
· | Our Bio-RFID technology platform can be integrated into a variety of wearable, mobile or counter-top form factors, as well as interoperability with existing products from current market leaders. 
· | No needles nor invasive transmitters in your body, making Bio-RFID sensors convenient and pain-free. 
· | No expensive supplies, such as test strips and lancets, are required to operate Bio-RFID devices. 

Growth Strategy 

The key elements of our strategy to grow our business include:


· | Initially, entering the diabetes continuous glucose monitoring market with our non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring products. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Following our entry into the continuous glucose monitoring market, entering other clinical monitoring markets for continuous, non-invasive hormone, medication metabolite, endocrinology components and biomolecular monitoring. 
· | Applying our Bio-RFID platform technology to lifestyle analysis, clinical trials and chronic illnesses. We believe that potential use cases include real time wearable medication monitoring and detection of, for example, ovulation and hormone deficiency.
· | Significantly, every new application will function utilizing the same sensor. You will not need a new device, simply a new software algorithm. 
· | Each new application provides new opportunities for monetization of the Bio-RFID platform technology. 

Research and Development

Our current research and development efforts are primarily focused on improving our Bio-RFID technology, extending its capacity, and developing new and unique applications for this technology and the AI deep learning platform that drives its analytics. As part of this effort, we conduct on-going laboratory testing to ensure that application methods are compatible with the end-user and regulatory requirements, and that they can be implemented in a cost-effective manner. We are also actively involved in identifying new applications. Our current internal team along with outside consultants have considerable experience working with the application of our technologies and their application. We engage third party experts as required to supplement our internal team.  We believe that continued development of new and enhanced technologies is essential to our future success. We incurred expenses of $5,385,586 and $3,969,972 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on development activities.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Particle, was focused on the development and commercialization of our extensive intellectual property relating to electromagnetic energy outside of the medical diagnostic arena which remains our singular focus. Since its incorporation, Particle has engaged in research and development activities on threaded light bulbs that have a warm white light and can inactivate germs, including bacteria and viruses. Particle is now looking for partners to commercialize this product.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, AI Mind, is focused on opportunities to monetize our AI deep learning platform over time. It is unlikely we will repeat the successful experiment with AI created art that sold as NFT in late 2021.We will, however, over time, continue to look for opportunities for new applications on our AI deep learning platform, to generate revenues to support the continued development of our non-invasive diagnostic technology.

Intellectual Property 

The cornerstone of our foundational platform technology is our intellectual property portfolio. We have pursued an active intellectual property strategy which includes focus on patents where appropriate and a diligent protection of trade secrets. To date, we have been granted 27 patents and 19 design patents. We currently have a number of patents pending and continue, on a regular basis, with the filing of new patents. We possess all rights, title and interest to the issued patents.

Our issued patents will expire at various times between 2027 and 2041. Pending patents, if and when issued, may have expiration dates that extend further in time. The duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.

The issued patents cover the fundamental aspects of our ChromaID and Bio-RFID technology and a number of unique applications. We have filed patents on the fundamental aspects of our Bio-RFID technology and growing number of unique applications. We will continue, over time, to expand our patent portfolio.  

Additionally, significant aspects of our technology are maintained as trade secrets which may not be disclosed through the patent filing process. We are diligent in maintaining and securing our trade secrets.

Related Patent Assets

Inherent in a platform technology is the ability to develop or license technology in diverse fields of use apart from our core focus. We focus on human health and wellness with a first focus on the non-invasive monitoring of blood glucose. We will pursue the identification of a multitude of analytes in the human body important to diagnostics over time. We will also identify, over time, opportunities for our intellectual property to be deployed in areas outside human health and wellness. Examples are Particle and AI Mind.

We expect although we cannot guarantee that we will create other such subsidiaries over time.  Additionally, we may license our intellectual property to third parties so that they may pursue activities that are not a part of our core focus. 

Employees

As of September 30, 2022, we had 16 full-time and part employees. Our senior management and other personnel are located in our Seattle, Washington offices. We periodically utilize consulting firms and individual contractors to supplement our workforce.
Government Regulation

United States

Our medical diagnostic products and operations, initially the KnowU and UBand glucose monitoring products, are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and its implementing regulations, guidance documentation, and standards. Our KnowU and UBand products will be regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The FDA regulates the design, development, research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, distribution, sale and advertising of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets. Any violations of these laws and regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if there is a change in law, regulation or judicial interpretation, we may be required to change our business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Under the FFDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness.

Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to FDA’s “general controls” for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.

Class II devices are subject to FDA’s general controls, and any other “special controls” deemed necessary by FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post-market surveillance. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, though certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, which in some cases may require submission of clinical data. Unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the FDA will place the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III, and the device sponsor must then fulfill much more rigorous premarketing requirements.

Class III devices, consisting of devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by general or special controls. Submission and FDA approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application is required before marketing of a Class III device can proceed. As with 510(k) submissions, unless subject to an exemption, PMA submissions are subject to user fees. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA application, which is intended to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, must be supported by extensive data, typically including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials.

510(k) Clearance

To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, known as a “predicate device.” A legally marketed predicate device may include a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 for which a PMA is not required (known as a “pre-amendments device” based on the date of enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976), a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data.

Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) submission for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) submission is incomplete, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. Once the 510(k) submission is accepted for review, by regulation, the FDA has 90 days to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.

If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.

After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a “letter to file” in which the manufacture documents the rationale for the change and why a new 510(k) is not required. However, the FDA may review such letters to file to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.

PMA Approval

A PMA must be submitted to the FDA for any device that is classified in Class III or otherwise cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process (although the FDA has discretion to continue to allow certain pre-amendment Class III devices to use the 510(k) process). PMA applications must be supported by, among other things, valid scientific evidence demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the device, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA application, once the FDA determines that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, the FDA will formally accept the application for review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180-days to review an “accepted” PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. During the review period, the FDA will typically request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR.

If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

In approving a PMA, the FDA may also require some form of post-market surveillance when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients.

New PMAs or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of a PMA-approved device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.

De Novo Classification

Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.

It is our current belief that our initial product is appropriate for a de novo classification request. 

Breakthrough Devices Program

The Breakthrough Devices Program is a voluntary program for certain medical devices and device-led combination products that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions.

The goal of the Breakthrough Devices Program is to provide patients and health care providers with timely access to these medical devices by speeding up their development, assessment, and review, while preserving the statutory standards for premarket approval, 510(k) clearance, and De Novo marketing authorization, consistent with the FDA’s mission to protect and promote public health.


10


The Breakthrough Devices Program replaces the Expedited Access Pathway and Priority Review for medical devices. The FDA considers devices granted designation under the Expedited Access Pathway to be part of the Breakthrough Devices Program.

We may pursue the Breakthrough Devices Program.

Clinical Studies

When FDA clearance or approval of a Class I, Class II or Class III device requires human clinical trials, and if the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, the device sponsor is required to file an IDE application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trial. If the device is considered a “non-significant risk,” IDE submission to FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the Institutional Review Board overseeing the investigation at each clinical trial site is required. Human clinical studies are generally required in connection with approval of Class III devices and may be required for Class I and II devices. The FDA or the Institutional Review Board at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance or approval to market the product in the United States.
Continuing Regulation

After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:


· | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; 
· | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved “off-label” uses; 
· | clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; 
· | approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our approved devices; 
· | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;
· | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; 
· | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; 
· | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; 
· | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and 
· | notices of corrections or removals. 

Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged, and adoption of the products would be impaired.


11


Furthermore, our products could be subject to voluntary recall if we or the FDA determine, for any reason, that our products pose a risk of injury or are otherwise defective. Moreover, the FDA can order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that our product would cause serious adverse health consequences or death.

The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of some of our subcontractors. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions including, but not limited to:


· | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; 
· | customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds; 
· | recall, detention or seizure of our products; 
· | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
· | refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products or modified products;
· | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; 
· | refusal to grant export approval for our products; or 
· | criminal prosecution.
