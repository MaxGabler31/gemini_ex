 Item 1. Business    ﻿
 General
 ﻿
 We are an oncology and urology biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines for prostate cancer and prostate cancer supportive care as well as near term specialty pharmaceuticals to address significant unmet needs in urology.
 ﻿
 Our prostate cancer pipeline consists of VERU-944 (zuclomiphene citrate, which is also known as cis-clomiphene) and VERU-111 (bisindole).    ﻿
 We are evaluating zuclomiphene citrate, an estrogen receptor agonist, in a Phase 2 trial to treat hot flashes, a common side effect caused by hormone treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer. 
 ﻿
 VERU-111 is an oral, next-generation, first-in-class small molecule that targets and binds to the alpha and beta subunits of microtubules in cells. Microtubules are essential for cell division and for shuttling critical growth receptors into the nucleus where they stimulate cell proliferation.  We are developing VERU-111 as a treatment for metastatic prostate cancer patients whose disease is resistant to both castration and androgen-blocking agent (abiraterone or enzalutamide) therapies.  We expect to enter a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of VERU-111 for this indication by no later than early January 2019.  We will also evaluate VERU-111 for a variety of other malignancies.  In June 2018, as part of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, we reported preclinical results showing the activity of VERU-111 against novel androgen blocking agent-resistant human prostate cancer, and we also reported preclinical data showing VERU-111’s anti-tumor activity against paclitaxel sensitive and resistant triple negative breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers. 
 ﻿
 In addition to our oncology drug programs, we are advancing four new drug formulations in our specialty pharmaceutical pipeline addressing unmet medical needs in urology. We are evaluating two different formulations of tamsulosin, the active ingredient in FLOMAX®, which we have developed to avoid the “food effect” inherent in currently marketed formulations of this drug.  Tamsulosin taken after a meal has different bioavailability and peak concentration characteristics as compared to when it is taken under fasting conditions, and as a result, patients are directed to take the drug 30 to 60 minutes after a meal to avoid declines in blood pressure that could result in dizziness or fainting.  We are developing our Tamulosin DRS (Delayed Release Sachet) granules and Tamsulosin XR (Extended Release) capsules to avoid this food effect, allowing for potentially safer administration and improved patient compliance.  In addition, Tamsulosin DRS granules may make it easier for the population of men who have difficulty swallowing pills and tablets (dysphagia) to be able to take this medicine instead of wearing diapers, having a urinary catheter, or having to undergo prostate surgery.  We expect to submit a new drug application (“NDA”) to the FDA for both Tamsulosin DRS and Tamsulosin XR in 2019. Separately, we are developing Tadalafil (CIALIS®) / Finasteride (PROSCAR®) combination tablets for inhibition of both phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) and 5-alpha-reductase to shrink an enlarged prostate and to treat the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH or enlarged prostate), with the added benefit of medicine to treat erectile dysfunction, with an NDA submission expected in 2019.  We believe Tadalafil and Finasteride combination tablets may increase both patient compliance and patient convenience.  We are also developing a delayed-release granule (DRG) formulation of Solifenacin, a selective M3 muscarinic receptor antagonist and the active ingredient in the leading drug for overactive bladder, VESIcare®, for patients who have difficulty with swallowing tablets.  We expect to submit an NDA to the FDA for Solifenacin DRG in 2019.
 ﻿
 In addition to these products under development, we market and sell the PREBOOST® wipe in the men’s health market and the FC2 Female Condom® (“FC2”) for women.  PREBOOST is a medicated individual wipe used for desensitizing male genitalia for the prevention of premature ejaculation.  We co-promote the PREBOOST wipe with Timm Medical Technologies, Inc.  We market and sell FC2 in the U.S. market by prescription and other sales channels and through our Female Health Company Division in the global public health sector.  Our Female Health Company Division markets to entities, including ministries of health, government health agencies, U.N. agencies, nonprofit organizations and commercial partners, that work to support and improve the lives, health and well-being of women around the world. FC2 is the only currently available female-controlled product approved for marketing by the FDA and cleared by the World Health Organization (the “WHO”) for purchase by U.N. agencies that provides dual protection against unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (“STIs”).

In October 2016, we completed our acquisition (the “APP Acquisition”) of Aspen Park Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“APP”).  The completion of the APP Acquisition transitioned us from a single product company selling only FC2 to a biopharmaceutical company focused on oncology and urology with multiple drug products under clinical development.
 ﻿
 Company History  
 ﻿
 Veru is a Wisconsin corporation that is the successor to The Wisconsin Pharmacal Company, Inc. (“Wisconsin Pharmacal”), a company which manufactured and marketed disparate specialty chemical and branded consumer products. Wisconsin Pharmacal was originally incorporated in 1971. In 1996, we completed a series of actions which resulted in our acquisition of worldwide rights to our first-generation female condom, the divestiture of Wisconsin Pharmacal’s other businesses and the change of our name to “The Female Health Company.” On October 31, 2016, we completed the APP Acquisition, which transitioned us from a single product company selling FC2 to a biopharmaceutical company with multiple drug products under development for urology and oncology. On July 31, 2017, we changed our corporate name from “The Female Health Company” to “Veru Inc.” reflecting our focus on biopharmaceutical products for oncology and urology. 
 ﻿
 Strategy  
 ﻿
 Our strategy is to develop a pipeline of novel prostate cancer and prostate cancer supportive care medicines as well as urology focused specialty pharmaceuticals while continuing to sell our commercial products to help fund part of this development. We intend to execute this strategy by leveraging the 505(b)(2) FDA regulatory pathway for our urology products in order to create nearer-term revenue to support the development of longer-term novel prostate cancer and prostate cancer supportive care medicines.  The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
 ﻿
 ﻿

· | Develop and launch high value novel products for prostate cancer and prostate cancer supportive care. We are developing two drugs, zuclomiphene citrate and VERU-111, each of which addresses large potential markets relating to prostate cancer and prostate cancer supportive care. We began a Phase 2 trial in the third quarter of 2018 using zuclomiphene citrate for the treatment of hot flashes caused by hormone cancer therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer, with results expected in mid-2019. Androgen deprivation therapy-induced hot flashes affect approximately 600,000 men in the U.S., representing an estimated market of $600 million annually. We also expect to start a Phase 1b/2 open label clinical trial of VERU-111 in treatment-resistant metastatic prostate cancer patients by no later than early January 2019, with clinical data results expected in the first half of 2019. The potential U.S. market for therapies in advanced prostate cancer is over $5 billion.

  ﻿

· | Advance near-term specialty pharmaceutical urology drugs that require only bioequivalence studies by taking advantage of information obtained in previous safety and efficacy studies conducted by other parties. We are advancing four new urology drug formulations in our specialty pharmaceutical pipeline, consisting of Tamsulosin DRS granules, Tamsulosin XR capsules, Tadalafil/Finasteride combination tablets and Solifenacin DRG granules. Each of these drugs leverage the 505(b)(2) FDA regulatory pathway to provide the potential for nearer-term revenue as compared to our oncology product candidates.

  ﻿

· | Grow our commercial products business. For FC2, we are focused on growing revenues in the U.S. market through prescription sales and by leveraging our relationships with external sales force groups, distributors and telemedicine providers, while continuing to pursue revenues in the public sector principally outside of the U.S. through tenders in key markets, including our recent tender award in South Africa. We are also focused on growing sales of PREBOOST® in the U.S. through our partner Timm Medical Technologies, Inc. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Capitalize on expertise and reputation of our management team and scientific advisors. Our management team has significant expertise and experience in urology and oncology as well as drug development, marketing and sales which will facilitate effective management of our preclinical studies and clinical trials of drug candidates and product commercialization. In addition, we intend to capitalize on the strong reputations of the members of our management and board of directors with academic institutions, hospitals, physicians, pharmacists and distributors to expand our customer base and to introduce new products.

 VERU 944 (zuclomiphene citrate) for the treatment of hot flashes caused by prostate cancer hormonal therapies in men with advanced prostate cancer.
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview.  Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer diagnosed in men, with over 161,000 new cases in the U.S. in 2017.  The estimated prevalence of prostate cancer in the U.S. is 2.35 million cases for which over one-third will have received androgen deprivation therapy.  Hot flashes, also known as vasomotor symptoms, are one of the most common and debilitating side effects of prostate cancer hormonal therapies.  Hormone therapies include androgen deprivation therapy, like LUPRON® (leuprolide) or ZOLADEX® (goserelin), as well as the newer agents approved to treat advanced prostate cancer such as ZYTIGA® (abiraterone) and XTANDI® (enzalutamide).  Up to 80% of men on androgen deprivation therapy complain of hot flashes with 30-40% having moderate to severe hot flashes.  Hot flashes are defined as intense heat sensation, flushing and profuse sweating and chills as well as anxiety and palpitations.  Although episodes of hot flashes often occur repeatedly and generally last a few minutes, some may last up to 20 minutes.  Hot flashes associated with prostate cancer hormonal therapies tend to persist over time with the same frequency and intensity throughout therapy.  Up to 50% of men continue to report hot flashes after five years on prostate cancer hormonal therapy.  Patients on prostate cancer hormonal therapy report significant effects on daily functioning and quality of life.  Hot flashes are one of the main reasons for patients to be noncompliant with their prostate cancer hormonal therapy.  As prostate cancer patients with advanced and metastatic disease are living longer because of more effective hormonal therapies, hot flashes have become an even bigger concern and impact on quality of life.
     Hormonal and nonhormonal therapies have been used off-label to treat hot flashes in men on prostate cancer hormonal therapies.  In general, hormonal agents especially estrogens have been shown off-label to be helpful for treating hot flashes.  However, off label estrogen treatment is complicated by lack of consistent dosing, gynecomastia (breast enlargement), gynecodynia (painful breasts), and increase in thromboembolic events.  Nonhormonal agents that have been also used off-label include anti-seizure agents and antidepressants that have serious side effects.  Moreover, nonhormonal agents tend to be less effective than hormonal therapies for the treatment of hot flashes.  There are no FDA-approved therapies for hot flashes caused by prostate cancer hormonal therapy in men with advanced prostate cancer.  CLOMID® (clomiphene citrate), which contains 30-50% zuclomiphene, appears to be well-tolerated in 39 published studies in over 2,200 men with doses as high as 400 mg/day and up to three years of use.  CLOMID® (clomiphene citrate) also contains the trans-isomer, enclomiphene which causes hot flashes, consequently, CLOMID® (clomiphene citrate) and generics cannot substitute for zuclomiphene citrate as they will actually exacerbate hot flashes. VERU-944 contains only zuclomiphene as the active ingredient.  Zuclomiphene is a nonsteroidal estrogen receptor agonist.  We believe that a nonsteroidal hormone therapy like zuclomiphene citrate has the potential to be an efficacious and well tolerated treatment for hot flashes caused by prostate cancer hormonal therapies in men with advanced prostate cancer.
 ﻿
 Development Plan. In June 2018, the Company submitted an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) with the FDA for zuclomiphene citrate.  In September 2018, the Company advanced zuclomiphene citrate directly to a Phase 2 clinical study and enrolled its first patient.  The double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of daily oral zuclomiphene citrate in patients with moderate to severe hot flashes caused by androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer. The study, conducted at multiple U.S. sites, is designed to enroll approximately 120 patients randomized to one of four treatment arms (zuclomiphene 10 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, or placebo). The primary endpoint of the study is the mean change in frequency of hot flashes relative to baseline at week 4 and maintained to week 12. The Company expects to report top-line results from this Phase 2 study in the first half of 2019.
 ﻿
 Market.  Hot flashes are the most common side effect of prostate cancer hormone therapy, with hot flashes occurring in approximately 80% of men receiving one of the common forms of androgen deprivation therapy, including LUPRON® (Leuprolide), ELIGARD® (Leuprolide), and FIRMAGON® (degarelix) and about up to 40% having moderate to severe hot flashes.  Approximately 600,000 men annually in the United States are on androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer.  There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for hot flashes associated with prostate cancer hormonal therapies.  The annual U.S. market for the treatment of hot flashes in men on prostate cancer hormonal therapies is estimated to be $600 million.

VERU-111, an oral, next generation, first-in-class small molecule for the treatment of metastatic prostate and other cancers.
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview.  In 2017, there were approximately 161,000 new cases of prostate cancer in the U.S. and about 25% will die from the disease.  In the U.S., 5% of men with prostate cancer will have metastatic cancer and up to 30% of men with high-risk, localized prostate cancer will develop metastatic cancer following initial therapy.  The median survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer ranges from 3.2 – 4.5 years.  For these men, the 1st line therapy is androgen deprivation therapy, or medical castration. Although most will initially respond, nearly all these patients will progress to metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and have a poor prognosis with an average survival of 1.5 years.  New 2nd line hormonal agents, like XTANDI® (enzalutamide) and ZYTIGA® (abiraterone/prednisone) have resulted in an additional four to five months of average survival, but again, nearly all men on these agents will develop progressive metastatic prostate cancer.
 ﻿
 Agents that target tubulin, the subunits of microtubules, have been shown to be the most effective targeted cytotoxic chemotherapies for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Microtubules are critical for cancer cell replication and to shuttle the androgen receptor into the nucleus where the receptor stimulates genes for cancer cell proliferation.  Docetaxel and cabazitaxel are examples of FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs that are given intravenously (IV) that target tubulin to treat metastatic prostate cancer.  Although effective, the challenges for this class of chemotherapy agents, also known as taxanes, include that they must be given intravenously (IV) and that the cancer cells develop resistance to taxanes. There are also serious safety concerns with IV taxanes which include serious hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression (neutropenia) and neurotoxicity such as peripheral neuropathy and muscle weakness.
 ﻿
 VERU-111 is an oral, next generation, first-in-class small molecule that targets and binds to the alpha and beta subunits of microtubules in cells. Microtubules are essential for cell division and for shuttling critical growth receptors into the nucleus where they stimulate cell proliferation. Unlike taxanes which bind to just the beta subunit of tubulin, VERU-111 binds strongly to both the alpha and beta subunits of tubulin.  VERU-111 has high oral bioavailability; less resistance as it does not interact with multiple drug resistance proteins so it cannot be pumped out of the cancer cell; minimal drug to drug interactions especially not metabolized by CYP3A4; and high activity against many tumor types including prostate cancer resistant to drugs like novel androgen blocking agents (abiraterone and enzalutamide) and taxanes as well as triple negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer.  In preclinical studies, VERU-111 appears to have less neurotoxicity and neutropenia compared to taxanes and vinca alkaloids chemotherapy agents. 
 ﻿
 Development Plan.  The Company plans to develop VERU-111 initially as a treatment for men with metastatic prostate cancer that is castration resistant and who have also failed to respond to ZYTIGA® (abiraterone) or XTANDI® (enzalutamide).  In September 2018, the Company completed a pre-IND meeting with the FDA for VERU-111 in which the FDA agreed with the Company’s plans for a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial and that an IND may be submitted for the indication of men who have metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and who have become resistant to become resistant to, or who have failed to respond to, ZYTIGA® (abiraterone) or XTANDI® (enzalutamide).  The Company anticipates submitting an IND and initiating an open label Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in early January 2019. An open label study means that every patient will receive VERU-111 and so the Company expects to have an early assessment of safety and efficacy of VERU-111 by the early part of 2019.  The Company plans to work closely with Johns Hopkins University and other highly regarded clinical sites to conduct this study.

Market.  In the U.S., there is a $5 billion annual market for 2nd line hormone therapies for prostate cancer and a $4.8 billion annual market for IV-given taxanes and vinca alkaloids chemotherapies (docetaxel $1 billion and cabazitaxel $500 million in prostate cancer) per Decision Resources Group and Allied Market Research.  Second line hormonal therapies like enzalutamide and abiraterone/prednisone have cross-resistance and do not appear to provide additional benefit when given in sequence for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.  VERU-111, as an oral therapy targeting alpha and beta tubulin, could be used prior to IV given docetaxel and cabazitaxel antitubulin chemotherapies.  VERU-111 could also be developed as a 1st line therapy given with androgen deprivation in men who have hormone sensitive, high volume prostate cancer where androgen deprivation therapy and docetaxel have been shown in several studies to increase survival in these men by 17-21 months.  Another 1st line indication could be developed in men who have metastatic prostate cancer and splice variants of the androgen receptor including a common variant known as AR-V7.  Prostate cancer hormone therapies are not effective in men who have AR-V7.  However, this type of cancer appears to respond to docetaxel and may be potentially treated by a novel oral therapy targeting alpha and beta tubulin like VERU-111.  VERU-111 could also be developed as 1st line metastatic indication in men who initially were treated with androgen deprivation therapy and a novel androgen blocking agent (enzalutamide or apalutamide) for nonmetatstatic castration prostate cancer that has now progressed to metastatic prostate cancer. Finally, VERU-111 could also be developed as an oral dosing alternative to chemotherapies for the treatment of metastatic breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers as these tumors also respond to IV taxane chemotherapies.
 ﻿
 Tamsulosin DRS granules (tamsulosin HCl 0.4mg for extended release oral suspension) and Tamsulosin 0.4mg XR capsules (tamsulosin HCl extended release capsules) for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms of BPH.
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview.  Tamsulosin DRS (Delayed Release Sachet) granules and Tamsulosin XR (Extended Release) capsules are new slow release formulations containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient in FLOMAX® (tamsulosin HCl) capsules which is a commonly used medicine for the treatment of symptoms of BPH, also known as enlargement of the prostate.  FLOMAX® is indicated for the treatment of symptoms of BPH.  Tamsulosin is a selective alpha1 adrenergic receptor blocking drug that is specific for the alpha1 adrenergic receptors located in the smooth muscle of the prostate and bladder neck.  Symptoms associated with BPH occur, at least in part, as a result of increased smooth muscle tone of the prostate and bladder which leads to constriction of urinary flow, urinary retention, urinary infection, kidney damage and life-threatening blood infection called urosepsis.  Blocking these alpha1 adrenergic receptors relaxes the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck resulting in the improvement of urinary flow rate and alleviation of the symptoms of BPH.  FLOMAX® capsules can only be taken after a meal. It has a “food effect” such that, if FLOMAX ® is not taken with food, the drug gets in too fast and men are placed at higher risk for dizziness and postural hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing that can lead to fainting). The Company is developing its Tamulosin DRS granules and Tamsulosin XR capsules to avoid this food effect, allowing for potentially safer administration and improved patient compliance.  In addition, both Tamsulosin DRS and Tamsulosin XR have granule formulations, as opposed to being a pill or a tablet, which may make it easier for the population of men who have difficulty swallowing pills and tablets (dysphagia) to take their medicine, increasing patient compliance.  Tablets and capsules are problematic for 15% of men over the age of 60 in the general community and the up to 60% of men in long term facilities who have difficulty or cannot swallow tablets and capsules because of certain medical conditions, including degenerative neurological diseases like Parkinson's, having suffered a stroke, and Alzheimer’s disease.  Not being able to take an alpha blocker drug for BPH, like FLOMAX®, because of difficulty or not able to swallow tablets and capsules may lead to the increased risk of acute urinary retention, urinary catheterization, urosepsis and death.  These men are currently managed with diapers, urinary catheters, or prostate surgery. 
 ﻿
 Development Plan.  Tamsulosin DRS granules and Tamsulosin XR capsules contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredient, tamsulosin, that is found in FLOMAX® (tamsulosin HCl 0.4mg) capsules and, as such, would be expected to have the same efficacy and safety as FLOMAX®. On August 12, 2016, the FDA agreed that the Company's Tamsulosin DRS medication qualifies for the expedited 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway.  In March 2017, the Company initiated a Stage 1 (pilot) bioequivalence clinical study for Tamsulosin DRS, and in April 2017, announced the successful completion of Stage 1 of the bioequivalence clinical study, which demonstrated that the blood levels of the Tamsulosin DRS over time were bioequivalent to FLOMAX®. In August 2017, the Company initiated Stage 2 of the bioequivalence clinical study of Tamsulosin DRS and in November 2017 announced the results of Stage 2 of the bioequivalence clinical study.  During the Stage 2 bioequivalence clinical study, dosing patients with Tamsulosin DRS while fasted and Tamsulosin DRS while fed successfully showed bioequivalence with FLOMAX® fed patients based on AUC, which is the key determinant of drug exposure over time.  The Tamsulosin DRS formulation did not meet the remaining bioequivalence criterion for peak value (Cmax). The 

 
10

 
Company intends to initiate a new bioequivalence study after adjusting the formulation to address Cmax and expects this study to be completed during the first quarter of calendar 2019.  Unlike FLOMAX®, the new tamsulosin granule formulation, based on the bioequivalence studies, does not appear to have a food effect which means that the new formulation may be administered without food. This difference may have a market advantage not only for men who cannot swallow capsules, but also for men who can swallow capsules. As a consequence, the Company is also developing Tamsulosin XR (extended release) capsules, which contain the new formulated granules, for the urology and primary care markets. The Company plans to submit an NDA for Tamsulosin DRS in 2019. 
 ﻿
 Market.  The initial commercialization plan for Tamsulosin DRS granules and Tamsulosin XR capsules is to target urology and primary care physicians with an oral branded product with no food effect for men.  The Company may also target men in long term care facilities and men in the community who have difficulty or cannot swallow tablets and capsules. Currently, tamsulosin oral suspension is not currently available, and if approved, Tamsulosin DRS and Tamsulosin XR would be the only oral suspension formulation that would be available on formularies in long term care pharmacies. The U.S. market for all alpha blockers for BPH is now estimated to be $386 million annually per IQVIA. Men in long term care or nursing homes have up to a 60% prevalence of swallowing difficulties and account for about 13% of total tamsulosin sales, whereas over 15% of men over 60 years of age in the general population have difficulty swallowing tablets and capsules. Tamsulosin DRS granules and Tamsulosin XR capsules, if approved, will be new specialty, not generic products.
     Tadalafil/Finasteride combination tablets (tadalafil 5mg and finasteride 5mg) for the initial treatment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms and enlarged prostate 
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview. Tadalafil/Finasteride combination tablet is a new, proprietary formulation that addresses men who have lower urinary tract symptoms and restricted urinary stream because of an enlarged prostate. CIALIS® (tadalafil 5mg) and PROSCAR® (finasteride 5mg) co-administration is indicated for the initial treatment of BPH for up to 26 weeks. CIALIS® (Tadalafil 5mg) is a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor and PROSCAR® (finasteride 5mg) is a Type 2, 5 alpha reductase inhibitor. Tadalafil 5mg daily has been approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and BPH. Finasteride 5mg has been approved the treatment of BPH: to improve symptoms, to reduce risk of acute urinary retention and the need for prostate surgery, and to prevent progression of BPH. 
 ﻿
 Development Plan. In a November 2017 Pre-IND meeting, the FDA confirmed that Tadalafil/Finasteride combination tablets qualify for a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. The FDA also agreed that a single bioequivalence study and no additional nonclinical, clinical efficacy and/or safety studies will be required to support the approval of Tadalafil/Finasteride combination tablets for the initial treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with enlarged prostates. The Company plans to complete the Tadalafil/Finasteride combination tablet bioequivalence study in 2018 and to file the NDA in 2019.
 ﻿
 Market. The worldwide prevalence of BPH lower urinary symptoms is estimated to be 10-25% of the male population and will rise to 1.1 billion men by 2018. Co-administration of CIALIS® and PROSCAR® is currently FDA approved for the initial treatment of symptoms of BPH for up to 26 weeks.  According to Elkelany O et al. (Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management 11:507-513, 2015), other men who may benefit from this co-administration include: 1) men who have a suboptimal response to 5 alpha reductase inhibitors alone (PROSCAR®(finasteride) or AVODART®(dutasteride)) 2) men who have a suboptimal response to an alpha blocker alone (FLOMAX® (tamsulosin), HYTRIN® (terazocin), UROXATRAL® (alfuzosin), CARDURA® (doxazosin), and RAPAFLO® (silodosin)) or in combination with a 5 alpha reductase inhibitor (JALYN® (dutasteride/tamsulosin combination)) and 3) men who have an optimal response to 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, but who also have erectile dysfunction. A Tadalafil 5mg / Finasteride 5mg combination tablet is not currently available.  A combination tablet would increase convenience and drug compliance. Poor compliance with a BPH medicine could lead to increase chance of acute urinary retention, urosepsis, and death. The Company would consider marketing and sales efforts of this product to urology, but seek co-promotion partners for primary care physicians in U.S.  The Company would seek pharmaceutical partnerships in territories outside the U.S.
 ﻿
 Solifenacin Delayed Release Granules (DRG) (solifenacin succinate for extended release oral suspension) for the treatment of overactive bladder.  
 ﻿
 Scientific Overview.  Solifenacin DRG is a new proprietary granule formulation containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient in VESIcare® (Solifenacin 5mg or 10 mg tablets). Solifenacin is a competitive selective M3 muscarinic receptor antagonist.  Solifenacin is indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) which are 

 
11

 
symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency in men and women. Muscarinic receptors play a major role in mediating contractions of the urinary bladder. 
 ﻿
 Development Plan. In a November 2017 Pre-IND meeting, the FDA confirmed that Solifenacin DRG qualifies for a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. The FDA also agreed that a single bioequivalence study will be sufficient to support the approval of Solifenacin DRG product for the treatment of overactive bladder and no additional nonclinical, clinical efficacy and/or safety studies will be required. The Company plans to complete the Solifenacin DRG bioequivalence study and file the NDA in 2019. 
 ﻿
 Market. Solifenacin DRG (solifenacin succinate extended release for oral suspension) is a new proprietary oral extended release granule formulation being developed for men and women with overactive bladder and dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing pills or capsules. In the U.S., the prevalence of OAB was similar in women and men, at 16.9% and 16%, respectively. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2014), up to 36.7% of short-term residents and 70.3% of long-term nursing home residents were not in complete control of their bladder (2014). Annual sales for VESIcare® tablets (5 mg and 10 mg) were approximately $1.1 billion dollars according to IMS Health 2017 sales data and worldwide annual direct costs of OAB are expected to be greater than 10 billion dollars by 2018. Like OAB, dysphagia (swallowing difficulty) is also a growing health issue in our aging population.  Up to 38% of elderly who live independently and up to 68% of elderly nursing home residents have difficulty swallowing. Swallowing difficulties are particularly prevalent in people who have Parkinson’s Disease (80%), Alzheimer’s Disease (40-70%) and Stroke (50%). These are the same conditions that are associated with OAB, and unfortunately, currently available selective M3 muscarinic receptor antagonists, including solifenacin, are only available as tablets. According to the FDA label, tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed or broken. Currently, Solifenacin DRG granules formulation is not currently available, and if approved, would be the only granules formulation of a M3 muscarinic antagonist that would be available on formularies in long term care pharmacies. A sales force is not required for this product as pharmacists and physicians in long term care facilities would identify patients that would benefit from this formulation.

 FC2 for dual protection against unintended pregnancy and STIs.
 ﻿
 Product.  FC2 is the only currently available female-controlled product approved for marketing by the FDA and cleared by the WHO for purchase by U.N. agencies that provides dual protection against unintended pregnancy and STIs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has referenced the use of condoms, including the female condom, as a means to reduce the risk of transmitting STIs, including HIV/AIDS, and the transmission of Zika by sex. FC2 was approved for market by the FDA as a Class III medical device in 2009 and is now classified as a Class II medical device, but still requires special testing controls for FDA approval.
 ﻿
 FC2 has basically the same physical design, specifications, safety, and efficacy profile as FC1, the Company's first generation female condom.  Manufactured from a nitrile polymer formulation that is exclusive to the Company, FC2 is produced more economically than FC1, which was made from a more costly raw material, polyurethane.   FC2 consists of a soft, loose fitting sheath and two rings: an external ring of rolled nitrile and a loose internal ring made of flexible polyurethane.  FC2’s soft sheath lines the vagina, preventing skin-to-skin contact during intercourse.  Its external ring remains outside the vagina, partially covering the external genitalia. The internal ring is used for insertion and helps keep the device in place during use.
 ﻿
 FC2’s primary raw material, a nitrile polymer, offers a number of benefits over natural rubber latex, the raw material most commonly used in male condoms.  FC2’s nitrile polymer is stronger than latex, reducing the probability that the female condom sheath will tear during use. Unlike latex, FC2’s nitrile polymer quickly transfers heat.  FC2 can warm to body temperature immediately upon insertion, which may enhance the user’s sensation and pleasure. Unlike the male condom, FC2 may be inserted before sex, eliminating disruption during sexual intimacy. FC2 is also an alternative to latex sensitive users who are unable to use male condoms without irritation. For example, 7% to 20% of the individuals with significant exposure to latex rubber (i.e., health care workers) experience such irritation. To the Company's knowledge, there is no reported allergy to the nitrile polymer.  FC2 is pre-lubricated, disposable, and approved for single-use to prevent pregnancy and the transfer of STIs.
 ﻿
 Global Public Health Sector Market.  FC2’s primary use is for disease prevention and family planning, and the global public health sector has been the main market for FC2. Within the global public health sector, various organizations supply critical products such as FC2, at no cost or low cost, to those who need but cannot afford to buy such products for themselves.
 ﻿

The Company has a relatively small customer base for FC2, with a limited number of customers who generally purchase in large quantities. Over the past few years, significant customers have included large global agencies, such as the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Brazil Ministry of Health either through UNFPA or Semina Indústria e Comércio Ltda (Semina), the Company’s distributor in Brazil, and the Republic of South Africa health authorities that purchase through the Company’s various local distributors. DKT, a new distributor for FC2, is one of the world’s largest providers of family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention products and services with offices in 24 countries. DKT has started registration processes to distribute FC2 in several countries this year to expand market access. These DKT countries include Afghanistan, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. Other customers in the global public health sector include ministries of health or other governmental agencies, which either purchase directly or via in-country distributors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  
 ﻿
 FC2 has been distributed in the U.S. and 149 other countries.  A significant number of countries with the highest demand potential are in the developing world.  The incidence of HIV/AIDS, other STIs, and unwanted pregnancy in these countries represents a remarkable potential for significant sales of a product that benefits some of the world’s most underprivileged people.  However, conditions in these countries can be volatile and result in unpredictable delays in program development, tender applications, and processing orders.
 ﻿
 The global public health sector market for male condoms is estimated to be greater than 8-10 billion units annually. The private sector market for male condoms is estimated at 10-15 billion units annually. The combined global male condom market (public and private sector) is estimated at a value of $4.5 billion annually.  The female condom market represents a very small portion of the total global condom market, yet 50% of individuals living with HIV/AIDS are women.  As a result a number of independent women’s groups are advocating for increased investment in and distribution of female condoms on a gender equality basis.
 ﻿
 The Company has distribution agreements and other arrangements with commercial partners which market as a consumer health product through distributors and retailers in 16 countries, including Brazil, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom. These agreements are generally exclusive for a single country. Under these agreements, the Company sells FC2 to the distributor partners, who market and distribute the product to consumers in the established territory. 
 ﻿
 On August 27, 2018, the Company announced that through six of its distributors in the Republic of South Africa, the Company had received a tender award to supply 75% of a tender covering up to 120 million female condoms over three years, which includes an award to the Company of up to 29.8 million units of the 40 million total units for the first year.
 ﻿
 U.S. Market.  We are pursuing opportunities to grow the market for FC2 in the U.S. as the only FDA approved female use product that protects against the transmission of STIs and unwanted pregnancies. FC2 is currently reimbursable by prescription under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) and growth of prescription sales in the U.S. is a key part of our strategy for FC2. As FC2 is nonhormonal, it is a viable alternative for many U.S. women who have reported dissatisfaction with the side effects of hormonal birth control. Moreover, there are unique groups of women such as breast cancer survivors who desire contraception and cannot take hormonal birth control because of this underlying condition.  We have built the necessary infrastructure to allow for broad access across the U.S. As a result, FC2 is now available through multiple access channels including: 98% of retail pharmacies, community based organizations, by prescription, telemedicine, universities, direct purchase and 340B qualified health care clinics, and directly to the public sector without distributors. Marketing and educational programs, both traditional and by digital and social media, are being developed and implemented to target health care providers (physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants), pharmacies, and women to coordinate awareness and access to FC2 that is fully reimbursable. We have also contracted with an external sales organization to promote FC2 in the U.S.

 PREBOOST® (4% benzocaine medicated individual wipes) for the prevention of premature ejaculation.    ﻿
 Product.  Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common sexual dysfunction and even more frequent than erectile dysfunction based on epidemiological studies.  Premature ejaculation is a self-reported diagnosis.  Men with premature ejaculation desire treatment; however, most are reluctant and unlikely to request treatment out of embarrassment.  Discrepancies also exist between the man and his partner's reports of the man's ejaculatory behavior as women have been found to report premature ejaculation affecting their relationship more often than their male

partner. 
     PREBOOST® is a proprietary OTC male genital desensitizer used for the treatment of PE.  There are no prescription products for PE approved by the FDA.  Off-label use of antidepressants and PDE-5 inhibitors has had limited success because of inconsistent efficacy and unacceptable side effects.  Psychological counseling and behavioral therapy are also used with mixed results.  Of the consumer health products, the topical anesthetics are administered as sprays and gels.  The drawbacks of these approaches include inconsistent dosing leading to too much anesthetic and transference of the anesthetics to the partner.  PREBOOST® is compliant with the FDA monograph and is approved in the United States.  PREBOOST® is the only individually packaged medicated wipe that contains a desensitizing agent (benzocaine 4.0%).  The advantages are:  1) Convenient individually wrapped wipes so it is easier to carry and to be discreet, 2) The correct dose is delivered each time, 3) The medicine is applied topically and dries quickly which prevents the potential for transference to partner, and 4) Benzocaine at 4.0% temporarily desensitizes, but does not completely numb the penis.    ﻿
 Market.  PREBOOST® is approved in the United States.  The Company has entered into a co-promotion and distribution agreement for PREBOOST® with Timm Medical Technologies Inc.  The Company also plans to increase sales by having a sampling program targeting urologists, introducing the product through additional internet outlets including Walmart, CVS, Walgreens and other OTC distribution outlets, optimizing its internet ecommerce capabilities and digital marketing via www.preboost.com as well as through out-licensing opportunities for markets outside the United States.    ﻿
 Government Regulation 
 ﻿
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices.  These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, tracking, approval, import, export, advertising, and promotion of our products.
 ﻿
 FDA Regulation of Female Condoms.  FC2 was approved for market by the FDA, via a Premarket Approval Application (PMA), as a Class III medical device in 2009.  On September 21, 2018, the FDA issued a final order reclassifying female condoms from Class III to Class II medical devices, renaming them “single-use internal condoms” and requiring new devices in this category to submit a 510(k) premarket notification and comply with various “special controls.” Special controls are a battery of product clinical testing which includes, but is not limited to, determining product effectiveness against pregnancy and against infection transmission, and product tolerability. Companies seeking clearance of new single-use internal condoms may now do so by demonstrating to the FDA in a 510(k) submission that a proposed condom is substantially equivalent to FC2 with respect to intended use and technology.
 ﻿
 All marketed devices cleared or approved by the FDA are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA.  As a result, we are required to register our manufacturing establishments with the FDA and list FC2 with the FDA as a commercially distributed device.  We must comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR), which requires that devices be manufactured and records be maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing, and control activities. We must comply with the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation requires that we provide information to the FDA whenever evidence reasonably suggests that one of our FC2 devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or where a malfunction has occurred that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.  Further, we are required to comply with FDA requirements for labeling, promotion and advertising.  Any future modifications to the design, technology or labeling of FC2 that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, require a new 510(k) clearance.  Non‑compliance with any of these requirements can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, total or partial suspension of production, and criminal prosecution.
 ﻿
 Because FC2 is a commercially distributed medical device, the facilities in which FC2 is manufactured and tested are subject to periodic FDA inspection to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, including the QSR and MDR regulations.  The Company’s most recent FDA inspection of its U.K. and Malaysian facilities was completed in September 2010. The Company’s previous office in Chicago was inspected by the FDA in October 2016 for activities related to being a registered agent and the FDA made observations at this inspection that the FDA expects us to have addressed by the next regularly scheduled inspection.

﻿
 FDA Regulation of Pharmaceutical Products.  The process required by the FDA before pharmaceutical product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 ﻿

· | nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, including some that must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | submission of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug candidate for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | FDA approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources.  Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a drug candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA.  The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30‑day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial by imposing a clinical hold.  In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.  Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.  A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.  Further, an independent institutional review board (IRB) for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial commences at that center.  Regulatory authorities or an IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board (DSMB), which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
 ﻿
 In general, for purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
 ﻿

· | Phase 1—Studies are initially conducted to test the drug candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion in healthy volunteers or patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Phase 2—Studies are conducted with groups of patients with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule, and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Phase 3—These clinical trials are undertaken in larger patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may be done globally to support global registrations. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved.  These so‑called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval.  The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a drug candidate and can provide important safety information. 
 ﻿
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug candidate, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.  The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product.  

 
15

 
Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 ﻿
 505(b)(2) Approval Process. Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides an expedited regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products.  Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.  The applicant may rely upon the FDA's findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the Reference Listed Drug (RLD).  The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the RLD.  The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 ﻿
 We expect our Tamsulosin DRS, Tamsulosin XR, Solifenacin DRG, Tadalafil/Finasteride and zuclomiphene citrate drug candidates to qualify for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway because they are or will be based on already approved active pharmaceutical ingredients rather than new chemical entities, and formulations that have been through Phase 1 studies.  On August 12, 2016, the FDA cleared Tamsulosin DRS for the expedited 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway and agreed with our plans to conduct a single bioequivalence study to support the filing of an NDA.  On December 6, 2016, based on positive regulatory recommendations by the Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs (BRUD) FDA Advisory Committee, we considered plans to file an IND and possibly initiate a Phase 2 clinical study for zuclomiphene citrate. On May 24, 2017, the FDA agreed with plans to enter the Phase 2 dose finding clinical trial to evaluate zuclomiphene citrate for the treatment of hot flashes in men on androgen deprivation therapy. In November 2017, the FDA agreed in Pre-IND meetings that Solifenacin DRG and Tadalafil/Finasteride combination tablets qualify for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.
 ﻿
 Orange Book Listing.  In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product.  Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book.  Any applicant who files a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product.  This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV certification.  If the competitor has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the RLD and the patent owner once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA.  The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification.  The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant.  The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii statement” certifying that its proposed label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the patented method‑of‑use rather than certify to a listed method‑of‑use patent. 
 ﻿
 NDA Submission and Review by the FDA.  The results of product development, nonclinical studies, and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA.  The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA.  The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions.  The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity.  Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.  The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.  Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, within 60 days after submission of the NDA, the FDA’s goal for a non‑priority review of a 505(b)(2) NDA is ten months to complete the review process for the application and respond to the applicant, which can take the form of either a Complete Response Letter or Approval.  The review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information, studies, or clarification.  The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, and/or require post‑marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.  FDA approval of 

 
16

 
any NDA submitted by us will be at a time the FDA chooses.  Also, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed.  Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace.  In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post‑marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post‑marketing studies. 
 ﻿
 Post‑Approval Requirements for Pharmaceutical Products.  Any pharmaceutical products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences.   Drug and biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third‑party manufacturers.  We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements.  If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the NDA.
 ﻿
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs.  A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity, and potency that are approved by the FDA.  Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties.  Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA.  Such off‑label uses are common across medical specialties.  Physicians may believe that such off‑label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances.  The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments.  The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off‑label use. 
 ﻿
 The recently enacted Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing.  Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product.  The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically.  Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed.  Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 
 ﻿
 Other Healthcare Regulations.  Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, promotion, distribution, medical education, and other activities will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services and its various divisions, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and state and local governments.  Our business activities must comply with numerous healthcare laws, including but not limited to, the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, the Veterans Health Care Act, and similar state laws. 
 ﻿
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs.  The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value.  There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution.  The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.  Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti‑Kickback Statute.  Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case‑by‑case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. 
 ﻿


 
17

 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. 
 ﻿
 We and our business activities are subject to the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 ﻿
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA and its implementing regulations require certain manufacturers of drugs and medical devices for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 ﻿
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.  Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity.  HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.  In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Outside the U.S., we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international, national and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. Legal requirements in the countries in which we do business relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes. More privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted, and more are being enforced, with potential for significant financial penalties. In the E.U., the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and imposes increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules.    ﻿
 The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 requires manufacturers of “covered drugs” to offer those drugs for sale to certain federal agencies, including but not limited to, the Department of Veterans Affairs, on the Federal Supply Schedule, which requires compliance with applicable federal procurement laws. 
 ﻿
 Depending on the circumstances, failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties, including criminal, civil, and/or administrative criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits, and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business. 
 ﻿
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.  Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access.  In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
 ﻿

Anti-Corruption Laws.  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business.  The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Other countries where the Company conducts business have similar anti-corruption laws, including the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act.
 ﻿
 Foreign and Other Regulation.  In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States.  The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval.  The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.  
 ﻿
 FC2 received the CE Mark which allows it to be marketed throughout the European Union.  FC2 has also been approved by regulatory authorities in Brazil, India, Canada, and other jurisdictions.  
 ﻿
 The Company’s facility may also be subject to inspection by UNFPA, USAID, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and country specific ministries of health.

 Intellectual Property  
 ﻿
 We will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business.
 ﻿
 As of December 10, 2018, we owned or held exclusive rights to twelve issued U.S. patents, nine pending U.S. patent applications and additional patents and patent applications in other jurisdictions outside the United States.  These include an international patent application relating to our Tamsulosin DRS granules that is subject to deferred payment obligations and patents and patent applications relating to our VERU-111 drug candidate that we license from a third party. The foreign issued patent and patent applications are in a number of jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, and Ukraine. Additional information regarding our patent portfolio is provided below.
 ﻿
 PREBOOST® Patent Application.  PREBOOST®, medicated individual wipes which is a male genital desensitizing drug product that helps in the prevention of premature ejaculation, is covered by a pending U.S. patent application.
 ﻿
 Tamsulosin DRS granules, Tamsulosin XR capsules, and Solifenacin DRG granules Patent Applications.  We own two patent applications with respect to Tamsulosin DRS granules, Tamsulosin XR capsules, and Solifenacin DRG granules: (1) an international patent application (would expire on May 2037) and (2) a European original application (would expire on October 2037).  Veru acquired those patent rights pursuant to a purchase agreement that provides for significant continuing installment and milestone payment obligations.  In addition, Veru granted a security interest in the purchased assets to the seller to secure Veru's present and future payment and performance obligations under the purchase agreement.  Accordingly, there will be significant payments that Veru will be required to make in the future to the seller of the Tamsulosin DRS granules, Tamsulosin XR capsule and Solifenacin DRG granules assets and the failure to make such payments may result in Veru losing its rights to such intellectual property.  If Veru fails to retain such rights, we would not be able to commercialize any products relating to Tamsulosin DRS granules, Tamsulosin XR capsules and Solifenacin DRG granules.
 ﻿
 Zuclomiphene Citrate Patent and Patent Applications. We have one issued U.S. patent and ten patent applications in countries outside the United States related to substantially pure zuclomiphene for the treatment of osteoporosis, bone fractures, loss of bone mineral density and hot flashes, especially in men on prostate cancer hormone therapies. The U.S. patent and any patents issuing from the foreign patent applications would expire in July 2035.
 ﻿

VERU-111 License.  We hold an exclusive license to seven issued U.S. patents, five pending U.S. patent applications and 50 patents and patent applications in countries outside the United States, including issued patents in the EU and Japan, relating to our VERU-111 drug candidate. This license contains provisions requiring upfront, milestone and royalty payments to the licensor (Ohio State University).  If we fail to comply with these obligations or other obligations to the licensor, the licensor might have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to commercialize these drug candidates. The patents relating to VERU-111 have statutory expiration dates from 2029 to 2030. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates with a maximum five-year patent term extension expected because of clinical development and FDA review time.
 ﻿
 FC2 Patents.  FC2 patents have been issued by the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, South Africa, the People’s Republic of China, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, India and the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO), which includes Botswana, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.  Further, the European patent for FC2 has been validated in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Spain, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Slovenia, Slovakia, and Turkey.  The patents cover the key aspects of FC2, including its overall design and manufacturing process.  The patents have expiration dates in 2023 and 2024.  
 ﻿
 Trademarks. The Company has a registration for the trademarks “FC2 Female Condom” and "PREBOOST" in the United States and has filed applications in the U.S. for the trademarks “Veru Inc.,” "Veru Healthcare," "Veru Biopharma," "Veru Pharmaceuticals" and "Veru Pharma."  The Company has filed applications or secured registrations in 40 countries or jurisdictions around the world to protect the various names and symbols used in marketing its Female Condoms.   
 ﻿
 We cannot be certain that any of our pending patent applications, or those of our licensors, will result in issued patents. In addition, because the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, the patents we own and license, or any further patents we may own or license, may not prevent other companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products.  Patents also will not protect our product candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without legally infringing our patents.  In recent years, several companies have been extremely aggressive in challenging patents covering pharmaceutical products, and the challenges have often been successful. We cannot be assured that our patents will not be challenged by third parties or that we will be successful in any defense we undertake. Failure to successfully defend a patent challenge could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 ﻿
 In addition, changes in patent laws, rules or regulations or in their interpretations in the United States and other countries by the courts may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 ﻿
 The term of an individual patent depends upon the legal term for patents in the country in which such patent is obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each medicine and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.
 ﻿
 As with other biopharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property positions for our product candidates will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, certain patent applications that we have filed or may file, or that we have licensed or may license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of corresponding patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent 

 
20

 
applications in the United States that also claim intellectual property to which we have rights, we may have to participate in proceedings in the USPTO to determine invention rights, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that any related patent may remain in force for a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.
 ﻿
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with any future collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants and by using invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of intellectual property that is developed through a relationship with a third party.
 ﻿
 Significant Customers
 ﻿
 Because FC2 provides dual protection against both STIs, including HIV/AIDS, and unintended pregnancy, it is an integral part of both HIV/AIDS prevention and family planning programs throughout the world.  These programs are typically supplied by global public health sector buyers who purchase products for distribution, at low cost or no cost, to those who need but cannot afford to buy such products themselves.  Within the global public health sector are large global agencies, such as UNFPA, USAID, DFID (the U.K.’s Department for International Development), and PSI (Population Services International), other social marketing groups, various government health agencies, and NGOs.  The Company’s most significant customers are either global public health sector agencies, country specific ministries of health, or those who facilitate their purchases and/or distribution. 
 ﻿    The Company's largest customers in fiscal 2018 were UNFPA, Barrs Medical (PTY) Ltd and USAID. UNFPA accounted for 32% of unit sales in fiscal 2018 and 25% of unit sales in fiscal 2017. Barrs Medical (PTY) Ltd accounted for 24% of unit sales in fiscal 2018. USAID accounted for 23% of unit sales in fiscal 2018 and 44% of unit sales in fiscal 2017. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of unit sales in fiscal 2018 or 2017.  The Company considers its most significant customers to be UNFPA, Barrs Medical (PTY) Ltd and USAID.
    
Employees   
 ﻿
 As of November 30, 2018, the Company had 171 full-time employees, including 19 located in the U.S., 11 in the U.K., 138 in Malaysia, and 3 in other countries to implement training and programs. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union. The Company believes that its employee relations are good.  In Malaysia, a significant proportion of direct labor is supplied by a contracted work force.  
 ﻿
 Environmental Regulation  
 ﻿
 The Company believes there are no material issues or material costs associated with the Company's compliance with environmental laws related to the manufacture and distribution of FC2.  The Company has not incurred environmental expenses in fiscal 2018 or 2017, nor does it anticipate environmental expenses in the foreseeable future.
 ﻿
 Raw Materials  
 ﻿
 The principal raw material used to produce FC2 is a nitrile polymer. While general nitrile formulations are available from a number of suppliers, the Company has chosen to work closely with the technical market leader in synthetic polymers to develop a grade ideally suited to the bio-compatibility and functional needs of a female condom.  As a result, the Company relies on supply for its principal raw material for FC2 from one supplier that could produce the raw material from multiple supply points within its organization.
 ﻿
 Manufacturing  
 ﻿
 The Company manufactures and warehouses FC2 within a leased facility with approximately 45,800 square feet of space in Selangor D.E., Malaysia. Production capacity at this facility is approximately 100 million units of FC2 annually. This facility is subject to periodic inspection by the FDA to ensure compliance with current Good 

 
21

 
Manufacturing Processes, as well as the U.K.-based notified body, which is responsible for CE and ISO accreditation.
 ﻿
 The Company expects to rely on third-party contract manufacturers and other third parties to produce, package and store sufficient quantities of any future drug candidates.  The Company has entered into an agreement with a third-party contract manufacturer to produce its PREBOOST® medicated individual wipes for managing premature ejaculation.
 ﻿
 Competition   
 ﻿
 FC2 participates in the same market as male condoms; however, it is not seen as directly competing with male condoms. Rather, studies show that providing FC2 is additive in terms of prevention and choice. Male condoms cost less and have brand names that are more widely recognized than FC2. In addition, male condoms are generally manufactured and marketed by companies with significantly greater financial resources than the Company. 
 ﻿
 Other parties have developed and marketed female condoms.  None of these female condoms marketed or under development by other parties have secured FDA market approval. FDA market approval is required to sell female condoms in the U.S.  USAID, a U.S. government funded agency, is required to procure from the FDA product approval for market; however there can be exceptions.  Outside of the U.S., the Company has experienced increasing competition and pricing pressures for FC2.  In addition to FC2, three female condoms have successfully completed the WHO prequalification process and been cleared by UNFPA for purchase by U.N. agencies: the Cupid female condom (which was prequalified by WHO in July 2012 and cleared by UNFPA thereafter), the Velvet female condom marketed by Hindustan Latex Limited (which was prequalified by WHO and cleared by UNFPA in March 2016) and the female condom marketed by PATH (which was prequalified by WHO and cleared by UNFPA in March 2016).  It is possible that other female condoms may complete the WHO prequalification process.  The female condom marketed by Hindustan Latex Limited, which is the Company’s former exclusive distributor in India, is substantially similar in design to FC2, except it is made of latex.  FC2 has also been competing with other female condoms in markets that do not require either FDA market approval or WHO prequalification.  Reflecting increased competition, Cupid received part of the last two South African tenders.  Increasing competition in FC2’s markets has, and will likely continue to, put pressure on pricing for FC2 and may also adversely affect sales of FC2.  Some customers, particularly in the global public health sector, prioritize price over other features where FC2 may have an advantage. The FDA’s recent reclassification of female condoms from Class III medical devices to Class II medical devices may reduce the barriers for other types of female condoms to enter the U.S. market. If other female condoms enter the U.S. market, we may face increased competition in the U.S., which may put downward pressure on pricing for FC2 and adversely affect sales of FC2 in the U.S. 
 ﻿
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress.  The success of our pharmaceutical products will depend on our ability to acquire, develop and commercialize products and our ability to establish and maintain markets for any products for which we receive marketing approval. Potential competitors in North America, Europe and elsewhere include major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions and government agencies.  Many of the competitors with respect to our pharmaceutical products under development have substantially greater research and development and regulatory capabilities and experience, and substantially greater management, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and financial resources, than we will.
 ﻿
 All drugs currently used to treat BPH symptoms are tablets or capsules.  These drugs include those that decrease size of the prostate, like 5 alpha reductase inhibitors which include PROSCAR® (finasteride) from Merck & Co., Inc. and AVODART® (dutasteride) from GlaxoSmithKline.  The other major class of drugs treat BPH by relaxing the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck and include alpha blockers like FLOMAX® (tamsulosin HCI) from Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, HYTRIN® (terazocin), UROXATRAL® (alfuzosin), CARDURA® (doxazosin), and RAPAFLO® (silodosin) from Allergan as well as Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors like CIALIS ® (tadalafil) from Eli Lilly.  One class of drugs combines a drug that shrinks and another that relaxes the prostate called JALYN® (dutasteride/tamsulosin combination) from GlaxoSmithKline. Boehringer Ingelheim has a tablet (non-powder) version of FLOMAX® called FLOMAX® CR now available in Canada that can be taken with or without food.  Similarly there is a tablet Tamsulosin product available in the UK called Cositam XL 400 microgram that can be taken independently of food.
 ﻿
 Although there are no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of hot flashes in men who have advanced prostate cancer as a side effect of prostate cancer hormone therapies, there are several drugs being used off-label including 

 
22

 
steroidal estrogens and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants including EFFEXOR® (venlafaxine) and anticonvulsants like NEURONTIN® (gabapentin) which could be competitive with our zuclomiphene citrate drug candidate for the treatment of hot flashes in men who have advanced prostate cancer as a side effect of prostate cancer hormone therapies.
 ﻿
 VERU-111 is expected to be a first-in-class oral therapy that targets both alpha and beta tubulin and will be initially developed for prostate, breast and ovarian cancers.  All currently available tubulin targeting agents are chemotherapies that are given IV include: Vinca Alkaloids such as VELBAN® (vinblastine), ONCOVIN® (vincristine) and NAVELBINE® (vinorelbine).  These chemotherapies are primarily used for hematologic malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, sarcoma), and some neuroblastoma, thyroid cancer and nonsmall cell cancer of the lung.  Taxanes such as TAXOL® (paclitaxel), TAXOTERE® (docetaxel) and JEVTANA® (cabazitaxel) are primarily used for solid tumors such as breast, ovarian, endometrial, cervical, lung, head and neck, esophageal, bladder, gastric and prostate.  TAXOTERE® (docetaxel) and JEVTANA® (cabazitaxel) are indicated for advanced metastatic prostate cancer, are given IV and bind to the taxane site of tubulin.
 ﻿
 The main therapeutic products that are competitive with PREBOOST™ include lidocaine and other anesthetic creams, gels and sprays.  Off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants like PAXIL® (paroxetine) have also been used off-label to prevent premature ejaculation.
 ﻿
 Backlog    ﻿
 Unfilled product orders for FC2 at November 30, 2018 and 2017 totaled $2.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively.  Unfilled orders materially fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, and the amount at November 30, 2018 includes orders with requested delivery dates later in fiscal 2019. The Company expects current unfilled orders for FC2 to be filled during fiscal 2019.
