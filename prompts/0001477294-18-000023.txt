ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

The Company
The reporting company is Sensata Technologies Holding N.V. (“Sensata N.V.”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the “Company,” “Sensata,” “we,” “our,” and “us.”
Sensata N.V. is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and conducts its operations through subsidiary companies that operate business and product development centers primarily in the United States (the "U.S."), the Netherlands, Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom (the "U.K."); and manufacturing operations primarily in China, Malaysia, Mexico, Bulgaria, France, Germany, the U.K., and the U.S. We organize our operations into two businesses, Performance Sensing and Sensing Solutions.
On September 28, 2017, the board of directors of Sensata N.V. unanimously approved a plan to change our parent company’s location of incorporation from the Netherlands to the U.K. To effect this change, the shareholders of Sensata N.V. are being asked to approve a cross-border merger between Sensata N.V. and Sensata Technologies Holding plc (“Sensata U.K.”), a newly formed, public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, with Sensata U.K. being the surviving entity (the “Merger”). 
To this end, on January 19, 2018, Sensata N.V. filed a definitive proxy statement (DEFM14A) regarding the proposed cross-border merger, which details the proposed plan and risks to the Company and shareholders. An extraordinary general meeting will be held on February 16, 2018, at which shareholders of record as of January 19, 2018 will be asked to vote on the proposed Merger. If approved by our shareholders, we will seek review and approval of the transaction by the U.K. High Court of Justice and would expect to complete the Merger in March 2018. If the Merger is consummated, Sensata U.K. will become the publicly-traded parent of the subsidiary companies that are currently controlled by Sensata N.V.
Overview
Sensata, a global industrial technology company, engages in the development, manufacture, and sale of sensors and controls. We produce a wide range of sensors and controls for applications such as pressure, temperature, and speed and position sensors in automotive systems, thermal circuit breakers in aircraft, and bimetal current and temperature control devices in electric motors. We can trace our origins back to entities that have been engaged in the sensors and controls business since 1916. 
Our sensors are customized devices that translate a physical phenomenon, such as pressure, temperature, or position, into electronic signals that microprocessors or computer-based control systems can act upon. Our controls are customized devices embedded within systems to protect them from excessive heat or current. Underlying these sensors and controls are core technology platforms—thermal and magnetic-hydraulic circuit protection, micro electromechanical systems, ceramic capacitance, Microfused Silicon Strain Gage, and wireless communication protocol—that we leverage across multiple products and applications, enabling us to optimize our research, development, and engineering investments and achieve economies of scale.
Our primary products include low-, medium-, and high-pressure sensors, speed and position sensors, bimetal electromechanical controls, temperature sensors, power conversion and control products, thermal and magnetic-hydraulic circuit breakers, pressure switches, and interconnection products. We develop customized, innovative solutions for specific customer requirements or applications across a variety of end markets, including automotive, heavy vehicle off-road ("HVOR"), appliance and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (“HVAC”), industrial, and aerospace, among others. 
Our Performance Sensing business supplies automotive and HVOR sensors, including pressure sensors, speed and position sensors, temperature sensors, and pressure switches. Our Sensing Solutions business supplies bimetal electromechanical controls, industrial and aerospace sensors, power conversion and control products, thermal and magnetic-hydraulic circuit breakers, and interconnection products.
We have long-standing relationships with a geographically diverse base of leading global original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and other multinational companies. 
We develop products that address increasingly complex engineering requirements by investing substantially in research, development, and application engineering. By locating our global engineering teams in close proximity to key customers in 
 4

regional business centers, we are exposed to many development opportunities at an early stage and work closely with our customers to deliver solutions that meet their needs. As a result of the long development lead times and embedded nature of our products, we collaborate closely with our customers throughout the design and development phase of their products. Systems development by our customers typically requires significant multi-year investment for certification and qualification, which are often government or customer mandated. We believe the capital commitment and time required for this process significantly increases the switching costs once a customer has designed and installed a particular sensor or control into a system.
We are a global business, with significant operations around the world. As of December 31, 2017, 39.6%, 35.5%, and 24.9% of our fixed assets were located in the Americas, Asia, and Europe, respectively. We have a diverse revenue mix by geography, customer, and end market. We generated 41.3%, 27.3%, and 31.4% of our net revenue in the Americas, Asia, and Europe, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 8% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was derived from the following end markets: 24.0% from European automotive, 18.6% from North American automotive, 19.1% from Asia and rest of world automotive, 14.3% from HVOR, 9.4% from industrial, 6.3% from appliance and HVAC, 4.6% from aerospace, and 3.7% from all other end markets. Within many of our end markets, we are a significant supplier to multiple OEMs, reducing our exposure to global fluctuations in market share within individual end markets.

Performance Sensing Business
Overview
Our Performance Sensing business accounted for approximately 74% of our net revenue in fiscal year 2017, and is a leading supplier of automotive and HVOR sensors, including pressure sensors, speed and position sensors, temperature sensors, and pressure switches. These products are used in a wide variety of automotive and HVOR applications, including air conditioning, braking, exhaust, fuel oil, tire, operator controls, and transmission. We believe that we are one of the largest suppliers of pressure and high temperature sensors in the majority of the key applications in which we compete. 
Our customers consist primarily of leading global automotive and HVOR OEMs and their Tier 1 suppliers. Our products are ultimately used by the majority of global automotive OEMs, providing us with a balanced customer portfolio, which, we believe, helps to protect us against global shifts in market share between different OEMs. 
Refer to Note 18, "Segment Reporting," of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details of the Performance Sensing segment profit for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 and total assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Performance Sensing Business Markets
Sensors are customized devices that translate a physical phenomenon, such as pressure, temperature, or position, into electronic signals that microprocessors or computer-based control systems can act upon. The market is characterized by a broad range of products and applications across a diverse set of end markets. We believe large OEMs and other multinational companies are increasingly demanding a global presence to supply sensors for their key global platforms. 
As automobiles and heavy vehicles evolve, we believe the need for cleaner, high-efficiency powertrains will help drive our growth for the foreseeable future. We expect this growth to include content growth in both pure gasoline and hybrid-electric powertrains. These vehicles require systems and sensors to drive high efficiency across the powertrain, managing better diagnostics, more efficient combustion, and reduced emissions. 
As new alternative powertrain technologies develop, opportunities are emerging to make electrified powertrains more efficient, robust, cost effective, and safe, which we believe has the potential to positively impact our business in the future. Sensor content on vehicle climate control systems, where we enjoy high market share, is increasing as electrified vehicles require greater efficiency. Other new emerging opportunities to improve on-vehicle energy density and battery life could also provide the potential for additional content per vehicle. 
With our increasing presence in China, we believe that our automotive and HVOR businesses are well positioned to grow. With sustained vehicle modernization in China, we expect our content per vehicle in China will mirror our global content in efficient powertrains and electrification, as well as content in tire pressure monitoring. 
In addition, we are taking steps and making investments with the intent of positioning ourselves to capitalize on what we believe will be a large, attractive market for autonomous vehicles. We continue to engage with customers who are seeking enabling sensor technology for autonomous driving. 
Moreover, we believe our broad customer base, global diversification, and evolving portfolio provide the foundation that will allow us to grow with these megatrends across a diverse set of end markets.
Automotive and HVOR sensors are included in the Performance Sensing business results, while industrial and aerospace sensors are included in the Sensing Solutions business results. Refer to the Sensing Solutions Business Markets section for discussion of industrial and aerospace sensors. 
Automotive and HVOR Sensors
Net revenue growth from the global automotive and HVOR sensor end markets, which include applications in powertrain, tire, air conditioning, and chassis control, among others, is driven, we believe, by three principal trends. First, global production of light vehicles has consistently demonstrated annual growth since the global recession in 2008 and 2009 and are expected to continue to increase over the long-term due to population growth and increased usage of cars in emerging markets. Second, the number of sensors used per vehicle has expanded, driven by a combination of factors including government regulation of emissions, greater efficiency, and safety, consumer demand for new applications including electric and hybrid-electric vehicles as well as trends toward autonomous vehicles and productivity and enhanced user interfaces in HVOR applications. For example, fuel economy standards such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy ("CAFE") requirements in the U.S. and emissions requirements such as "Euro 6d" in Europe and "China National 6" in China lead to sensor-rich automobile powertrain strategies. Finally, revenue growth has been augmented by a continuing shift away from legacy electromechanical products towards higher-value electronic solid-state sensors.
According to the fourth quarter 2017 LMC Automotive "Global Car & Truck Forecast," the production of global light vehicles in 2017 was approximately 95.2 million units, an increase of 2.3% from 2016.
The automotive and HVOR sensor markets are characterized by high switching costs and barriers to entry, benefiting incumbent market leaders. Sensors are critical components that enable a wide variety of applications, many of which are essential to the proper functioning of the product in which they are incorporated. Sensor application-specific products require close engineering collaboration between the sensor supplier and the OEM or the Tier 1 supplier. As a result, OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers make significant investments in selecting, integrating, and testing sensors as part of their product development. Switching to a different sensor results in considerable additional work, both in terms of sensor customization and extensive platform/product retesting and certification. This results in high switching costs for automotive and HVOR manufacturers once a sensor is designed-in. We believe the foregoing is one of the reasons that sensors are rarely changed during a platform life-cycle, which in the case of the automotive end market typically lasts five to seven years. Given the importance of reliability and the fact that the sensors must be supported through the length of a product life, our experience has been that OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers tend to work with suppliers that have a long track record of quality and on-time delivery and the scale and resources 
 6

to meet their needs as the automobile platform evolves and grows. In addition, the automotive segment is one of the largest markets for sensors, giving participants with a presence in this end market significant scale advantages over those participating only in smaller, more niche industrial and medical markets.
According to an October 2017 report prepared by Strategy Analytics, Inc., the global automotive sensor market was $22.4 billion in 2017, compared to $21.5 billion in 2016. We believe the increase in the number of sensors per vehicle and the level of global vehicle sales are the primary drivers of the increase in the global automotive sensor market. We believe that the increasing installation in vehicles of emissions, efficiency, safety, and comfort-related features that depend on sensors for proper functioning, such as electronic stability control, tire pressure monitoring, advanced driver assistance, transmission, and advanced combustion and exhaust after-treatment, will continue to drive increased sensor usage and content growth.

Sensing Solutions Business
Overview
Our Sensing Solutions business accounted for approximately 26% of our net revenue in fiscal year 2017, and is a leading provider of bimetal electromechanical controls, industrial and aerospace sensors, power conversion and control products, thermal and magnetic-hydraulic circuit breakers, and interconnection products. We market and manufacture a broad portfolio of application-specific products, including motor and compressor protectors, motor starters, temperature sensors and switches/thermostats, pressure sensors and switches, electronic HVAC sensors and controls, linear and rotary position sensors, charge controllers, solid state relays, circuit breakers, semiconductor burn-in test sockets, and power inverters. Our control products are sold into industrial, aerospace, military, commercial, medical device, and residential end markets. We derive most of our Sensing Solutions business revenue from sales of products that prevent damage from excess heat or electrical current in a variety of applications within these end markets, such as internal and external motor and compressor protectors, circuit 
 7

protection, motor starters, thermostats, switches, semiconductor testing, and light industrial systems. Our industrial and aerospace sensors, including pressure sensors, temperature sensors, and linear and rotary position sensors, provide real time information about the state of a specific system or subsystem, so control adjustments can be made to optimize system performance. We believe that we are one of the largest suppliers of controls in the majority of the key applications in which we compete. 
Our Sensing Solutions business benefits from strong agency relationships. For example, a number of electrical standards for motor control products, including portions of the Underwriters’ Laboratories ("UL") Standards for Safety, have been written based on the performance and specifications of our control products. We also have U.S. and Canadian Component Recognitions from UL, a U.S.-based organization that issues safety standards for many electrical products in the U.S., for many of our control products, so that customers can use Klixon® and Airpax® products throughout North America. Where our component parts are detailed in our customers' certifications from UL, changes to their certifications may be necessary in order for them to incorporate competitors' motor protection offerings. Similarly, our aerospace products undergo exhaustive qualification procedures to customer or military performance standards; requiring a significant investment in a re-qualification effort to incorporate competitors’ offerings.
We continue to focus our efforts on expanding our presence in all global geographies, both emerging and mature. Our customers include established multinationals, as well as local producers in emerging markets such as China, India, Eastern Europe, and Turkey. China continues to remain a priority for us because of its export focus and domestic consumption of products that use our devices. In addition, we continue to focus on managing our costs and increasing our productivity in these lower-cost manufacturing regions.
Refer to Note 18, "Segment Reporting," of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details of the Sensing Solutions segment profit for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 and total assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Sensing Solutions Business Markets
Sensing Solutions products include controls, which are customized devices that protect equipment and electrical architecture from excessive heat or current, and sensors, which measure specific fluid- or air-based system parameters, including pressure and temperature, as well as measure position. Our products help our customers' systems run safely and in an efficient and environmentally-friendly manner. Our product lines encompass bimetal electromechanical controls, industrial and aerospace sensors, power conversion and control products, thermal and magnetic-hydraulic circuit breakers, and interconnection products, each of which serves a highly diversified base of customers, end markets, applications, and geographies. 
Bimetal Electromechanical Controls
Bimetal electromechanical controls include motor protectors, motor starters, thermostats, and switches, each of which helps prevent damage from excessive heat or current. Our bimetal electromechanical controls business serves a diverse group of end markets, including commercial and residential HVAC and refrigeration systems, lighting, industrial motors, household appliances, and commercial and military aircraft. The demand for many of these products tends to follow the general economic environment and is affected by the increasing significance of new electronically-controlled applications.
Industrial and Aerospace Sensors
Industrial and aerospace sensors employ similar technology to automotive and HVOR sensors discussed in the Performance Sensing Business section above, but often require different customization in terms of packaging, calibration, and electrical output. Applications in which these sensors are used include fluid- and air-based system measurement, motion control systems, pumps and storage tanks, where measurement of pressure and temperature is required for optimum performance, and commercial and military aircraft controls, where high reliability is required. End markets served by this business include: commercial and residential HVAC and refrigeration systems, where refrigerant, water, or air is the sensed media used to optimize performance of the heating and cooling application; discrete industrial equipment where fluid- or air-based subsystems are used (e.g., air compressors and hydraulic machinery such as molding and metal machining); and commercial and military aircraft. 
Linear and rotary position sensors translate linear or angular mechanical position to an electrical signal, and are typically used in systems where high reliability is desired, such as commercial and military aircraft controls. The primary uses for our linear and rotary position sensors are in harsh environments in the aerospace and energy and infrastructure end markets.
We believe that sensor usage in industrial and commercial applications is driven by many of the same factors as in the 
 8

automotive sensor market: regulation of emissions, greater energy efficiency, and safety, as well as consumer demand for new features. For example, many HVAC/Refrigeration ("HVAC/R") and industrial systems are converting to more efficient variable speed control, which inherently requires more sensor feedback than traditional fixed speed control systems. Global trends towards environmentally friendly refrigerants also require more sensors to deliver the desired system performance.
Power Conversion and Control
Power conversion and control products include power inverters, charge controllers, and solid state relays.
Our power inverter products enable conversion of electric power from direct current ("DC") power to alternating current ("AC") power, or AC power to DC power. Power inverters are used mainly in applications where DC power, such as that stored in a battery, must be converted for use in an electrical device that runs on AC power, or in applications where AC power is converted to DC power to charge batteries or power DC loads. Typically, converting AC power to DC power also uses a charge controller. 
Specific uses for power inverters and charge controllers include powering applications in utility/service trucks or recreational vehicles and providing power conversion and charge control for off-grid and grid-tie battery back-up systems. Demand for these products is driven by economic development, the need to meet new energy efficiency standards, electrification of auxiliary loads on work trucks, emerging opportunities for residential energy storage and off-grid power systems, and a growing interest in clean energy to replace generators, which increases demand for both mobile and stationary power. 
Solid state relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by a low-power signal, or where several circuits must also be controlled by one signal. Solid state relays have certain advantages over mechanical relays, including long operation life, silent operation, low power, and low electrical interference. Applications for solid state relays primarily include those in the industrial and commercial equipment end markets. 
Thermal and Magnetic-Hydraulic Circuit Breakers
Our circuit breaker portfolio includes thermal circuit breakers and customized magnetic-hydraulic circuit breakers, which help prevent damage from thermal or electrical overload. We provide thermal circuit breakers to the commercial and military aircraft markets as well as the industrial and agricultural markets. Our magnetic-hydraulic circuit breaker business serves a broad spectrum of OEMs and other multinational companies in the aerospace, telecommunication, industrial, recreational vehicle, HVAC, refrigeration, marine, medical, information processing, electronic power supply, power generation, over-the-road trucking, construction, agricultural, and alternative energy markets. Demand for these products tends to follow the general economic environment.
Interconnection
Our interconnection products consist of semiconductor burn-in test sockets used by semiconductor manufacturers to verify packaged semiconductor reliability. Demand in the semiconductor market is driven by consumer and business computational, entertainment, transportation, and communication needs. These needs are driven by the desire to have smaller, lighter, faster, more functional, and energy conscious devices that make users more productive and interconnected to society.

Technology and Intellectual Property
We rely primarily on patents and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. While we consider our patents to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our overall competitive position is dependent on patent protection or that our overall operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. Many of our patents protect specific functionality in our products, and others consist of processes or techniques that result in reduced manufacturing costs. Our patents generally relate to improvements on earlier filed Sensata, acquired, or competitor patents. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 315 U.S. and 370 non-U.S. patents and approximately 41 U.S. and 227 non-U.S. pending patent applications that were filed within the last five years. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2018 to 2042. We incurred Research and Development expense of $130.2 million, $126.7 million, and $123.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
We use licensing arrangements with respect to certain technology provided in our sensor products and, to a lesser extent, our control products. In 2006, we entered into a perpetual, royalty-free cross-license agreement with our former owner, Texas Instruments Incorporated ("TI"), which permits each party to use specified technology owned by the other party in its business. No license may be terminated under the agreement, even in the event of a material breach. 
 10

We purchase sense element assemblies, which are components used primarily in our monosilicon strain gage pressure sensors, from Measurement Specialties, Inc. and its affiliates ("MEAS") and also manufacture them internally as a second source. In March 2013, we entered into an intellectual property licensing arrangement (the "License Agreement") with MEAS that provides for an indefinite duration license and is subject to royalties through 2019 and thereafter is royalty-free. Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, we are authorized to produce our entire need for these sense elements within the passenger vehicle and heavy duty truck fields of use. The License Agreement can be terminated by either party in the event of an uncured material breach. The sense element assemblies subject to the License Agreement accounted for $413.2 million, $397.7 million, and $386.3 million in net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, of which $64.8 million, $150.6 million, and $206.7 million, respectively, was related to products that were manufactured by MEAS, and $348.4 million, $247.1 million, and $179.6 million, respectively, was related to products that were manufactured by us. 
Seasonality
Because of the diverse global nature of the markets in which we operate, our revenue is only moderately impacted by seasonality. However, our Sensing Solutions business has some seasonal elements, specifically in its air conditioning and refrigeration products, which tend to peak in the first two quarters of the year as end market inventory is built up for spring and summer sales. In addition, our Performance Sensing business tends to be weaker in the third quarter of the year as automotive OEMs retool production lines for the coming model year.
Sales and Marketing
The sales and marketing function within our business is organized into regions—the Americas, Asia, and Europe—but also organizes globally across all geographies according to market segments, so as to facilitate knowledge sharing and coordinate activities involving our larger customers through global account managers. 
Customers
Our customer base in the Performance Sensing business includes a wide range of OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers in the automotive and HVOR end markets. Our customers in the Sensing Solutions business include a wide range of industrial and commercial manufacturers and suppliers across multiple end markets, primarily OEMs in the climate control, appliance, semiconductor, medical, energy and infrastructure, data/telecom, and aerospace industries, as well as Tier 1 aerospace and motor and compressor suppliers. In geographic and product markets where we lack an established base of customers, we rely on third-party distributors to sell our sensor and control products. We have had relationships with our top ten customers for an average of 28 years. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 8% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
Selected Geographic Information
Refer to Note 18, "Segment Reporting," of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details of our net revenue by selected geographic areas for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 and PP&E, net by selected geographic area as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Competition
Within each of the principal product categories in our Performance Sensing business, we compete with a variety of independent suppliers as well as the in-house operations of Tier 1 systems suppliers. We believe that the key competitive factors in this market are product performance, quality, and reliability, the ability to produce customized solutions on a global basis, technical expertise and development capability, breadth and scale of product offerings, product service and responsiveness, and price. 
Within each of the principal product categories in our Sensing Solutions business, we compete with divisions of large multinational industrial corporations and companies with smaller market share, which compete primarily in specific end markets or applications. We believe that the key competitive factors in these markets are product performance, quality, and reliability, although manufacturers in certain markets also compete based on price. Physical proximity to the facilities of the OEM/Tier 1 manufacturer customer has, in our experience, also increasingly become a basis for competition. We have additionally found that certain of the product categories have specific competitive factors. For example, for thermal circuit breaker, thermostat, and switch products, strength of technology, quality, and the ability to provide custom solutions are particularly important. With hydraulic-magnetic circuit breakers, as another example, we have encountered heightened competition on price and a greater emphasis on agency approvals, including approvals by UL and military agencies, and similar organizations outside of the U.S., such as Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik, and TÜV Rheinland in Europe, China Compulsory Certification in China, and Canadian Standards Association in Canada.
 11

Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 22,100 employees, of whom approximately 8% were located in the U.S. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 530 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, in various countries, local law requires our participation in works councils. We also engage contract workers in multiple locations, primarily to cost-effectively manage variations in manufacturing volume, but also to perform engineering and other general services. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 2,030 contract workers on a worldwide basis. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Environmental Matters and Governmental Regulation
Our operations and facilities are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and our employees, including those governing air emissions, water discharges, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We are, however, not aware of any threatened or pending material environmental investigations, lawsuits, or claims involving us or our operations. As of December 31, 2017, compliance with federal, state, and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We have not budgeted any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during 2018.
Our products are governed by material content restrictions and reporting requirements, examples of which include: European Union regulations, such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals), RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances), and ELV (End of Life Vehicles); U.S. regulations, such as the conflict minerals requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and similar regulations in other countries. Numerous customers, across all end markets, are requiring us to provide declarations of compliance or, in some cases, full material content disclosure as a requirement of doing business with them.
We are subject to compliance with laws and regulations controlling the export of goods and services. Certain of our products are subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulation (“ITAR”). The export of many such ITAR-controlled products requires an individual validated license from the U.S. State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The State Department makes licensing decisions based on type of product, destination of end use, end user, national security, and foreign policy. The length of time involved in the licensing process varies but currently averages approximately six to eight weeks. The license processing time could result in delays in the shipping of products. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and any such change may require us to change technology or incur expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations.
