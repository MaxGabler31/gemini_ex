Item 1. Business
Overview
Cryoport Inc. (“Cryoport,” “we,” “our,” or the “company”) is a global leader in serving the life sciences industry as a trusted provider of integrated temperature-controlled supply-chain solutions supporting the biopharma/pharma, animal health, and reproductive medicine markets. Our mission is to support life and health worldwide and we are continuously developing, implementing, and leveraging our supply chain platform, which is designed to deliver comprehensive, unparalleled, highly differentiated temperature-controlled logistics, packaging, storage, cryogenic systems, informatics, and related services for life science products, regenerative medicine, cellular therapies, and treatments that require unique, specialized cold chain management.
Spread across 15 countries and 33 locations worldwide, we serve more than 3,000 customers working in biopharmaceutical, animal husbandry and reproductive medicine companies, universities, research institutions and government agencies. Our platform of solutions together with our global team of more than 850 colleagues delivers a unique combination of innovative supply chain technologies and services through our industry-leading brands, Cryoport Systems, CryoStork®, MVE Biological Solutions, CRYOPDP, and CRYOGENE.
Cryoport’s advanced supply chain platform, comprised of comprehensive and technology-centric systems and solutions, are designed to support the global high-volume distribution of commercial biologic and cell-based products and therapies regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other international regulatory bodies for distribution in the Americas, EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) and APAC (Asia-Pacific) regions. Cryoport’s solutions are also designed to support pre-clinical, clinical trials, Biologics License Applications (BLA), Investigational New Drug Applications (IND) and New Drug Applications (NDA) with the FDA, as well as global clinical trials initiated in other countries, where strict regulatory compliance and quality assurance is mandated. Over the last several years, we have grown to become a leader in supporting the clinical trials and commercial launches of cell and gene therapies globally. As of the end of the fiscal year of 2021, we supported 602 clinical trials and eight commercial therapies, including KYMRIAH by Novartis, YESCARTA and TECARTUS by Gilead/Kite, and BREYANZI and ABECMA by Bristol-Myers Squibb. A total of eleven (11) Cryoport-supported Biologic License Applications (BLAs) or Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) were filed in fiscal year 2021, based on internal information and forecasts from the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, of which two (2) were filed during the fourth quarter of 2021. Looking forward, we anticipate up to nineteen (19) BLA and MAA submissions for Cryoport-supported products during 2022. Those therapies that receive commercial approval will provide opportunities to become significant revenue drivers for us in the future as the majority of them will require temperature-controlled storage, comprehensive temperature-controlled supply chain support and other services at commercial scale, and we expect that many will select us as their critical supply chain solution as a result of our work in connection with their respective clinical trials and track record in the market.
Cryoport’s advanced supply chain platform also supports the animal health market and the human reproductive market. The animal health market is mainly composed of supporting animal husbandry, as well as companion and recreation animal health. The human reproductive market which is largely composed of In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) support for patients and clinics.
Our industry standard setting Chain of Compliance® solutions, which include vital analytics, such as ‘chain-of-condition’ and ‘chain-of-custody’ information in a single data stream, empower our clients’ continuous vigilance over their respective commodities. In addition, our Chain of Compliance® standard ensures full traceability of the equipment used and the processes employed during storage, fulfillment, and distribution, further supporting each client’s goal of minimizing risk and maximizing success of their respective new biologics or other products and therapies as they are introduced into the global markets.
As part of our services, our platform of technologies provides the ability for Cryoport personnel, and our clients, to monitor conditions of the internal physical environment, geographic location and other specified critical variables for each shipment or sample in near real time. In accordance with client requirements, information is recorded and archived for each shipment or sample for scientific, quality assurance and regulatory purposes in a secure cloud-based system that can be accessed by authorized personnel globally. This information provides an audit trail that can verify the in-shipment or sample condition in which the life sciences commodity, material, product, vaccine, or therapy was shipped and/or stored.

One of the most important features of our supply chain solutions platform is our suite of sophisticated, cloud-based, logistics management platforms, which are branded as the Cryoportal® Logistics Management Platform (the “Cryoportal®”), and CRYOPDP UnITy platform, both of which are supported by an integrated control tower. These platforms support the management of shipments through a single interface, which includes order entry, document preparation, customs documentation, courier management, near real-time shipment tracking and monitoring, issue resolution, and regulatory compliance requirements. In addition,they provide unique and incisive information dashboards and validation documentation for every shipment through data collected by the SmartPak ™ Condition Monitoring System(s) (the “SmartPak™”). The Cryoportal® can record and retain a fully documented history of all Cryoport Express® and ELITE™ Shippers, including chain-of-custody, chain-of-condition, chain-of-identity, and Chain of Compliance™ information for each shipment, which is used to ensure that the stability of shipped biologic commodities are maintained throughout the shipping cycle. At the client’s option, recorded information is archived, allowing the client to meet exacting requirements necessary for scientific work and/or proof of regulatory compliance during the logistics process. CRYOPDP’s UnITy transportation management platform contains various modules that include a tracking, order management, asset management, all of which report up to a main control tower to ensure full supply chain visibility and supporting analytics.
Cryoport’s MVE Biological Solutions systems are an important part of our global supply chain platform. MVE Biological Solutions is the leading global manufacturer of temperature-controlled storage and distribution equipment and systems. MVE has set the standard for the manufacture of cryogenic systems including vacuum insulated products and cryogenic freezer and shipper solutions used for storage and/or distribution of critical biological material for more than 50 years. MVE Biological Solutions’ equipment is used extensively throughout the life sciences industry and is the trusted solution within the regenerative medicine space for the storage and distribution of cell and gene therapies. Moreover, Cryoport Systems in conjunction with MVE Biological Solutions are developing a new platform of ultra-low temperature smart packaging for cell and gene therapy distribution through a new purpose built Cryoport ELITE™ product line. The first two products in the Cryoport ELITE™ line to launch will be the Cryosphere™, which is a first of its kind gravitationally stabilized cryogenic shipper aimed at supporting of cell therapies and a novel ELITE™-80°C shipper, which, is purpose built for the support of gene therapy distribution and upstream viral vector products. Both these products are being launched to complement our current Cryoport Express® and CRYOPDP Temperature Controlled Packaging Solutions.

Cryoport’s mission is to enable the life sciences to save and improve lives around the world by providing certainty throughout the supply chain – one patient, one therapy, one product at a time. Our people, innovative solutions, and industry leading technologies have been designed to exceed current standards to deliver certainty and de-risk the process across the entire supply chain for the life sciences.
Competitive Advantages
With our first-to-market integrated platform of services, technology-driven supply-chain solutions and decades of experience serving the life sciences industry, we have established a substantial lead over potential competitors. Furthermore, we are not aware of any company that offers services comparable to Cryoport’s full platform of solutions, capabilities, or competencies. Working with our depth of knowledge in information technology, bioservices, packaging, temperature-controlled logistics, and cryogenic systems, our management, technical, business development and service support teams approach our growing markets with adaptability, innovation, and creative thinking.
The most common alternatives to Cryoport’s platform of solutions are “older technologies” and/or systems as well as cobbled together, non-integrated platforms. In fact, a portion of the biopharma market and much of the animal health market still uses liquid nitrogen in its hazard liquid form and/or dry ice with no ongoing validation processes for equipment or procedures. In the case of dry ice, the technology delivers temperatures of approximately -80℃ with standard deviations up to 14℃. Consequently, it provides an environment that allows cellular activity to continue and cells to degrade, impacting cell line performance and cell viability. On the other hand, liquid nitrogen, while effective in holding cryogenic temperatures, is bulky, heavy, expensive and requires special handling to avoid spillage and accommodate weight restrictions. Both dry ice and liquid nitrogen are classified “hazardous” by IATA and, therefore, are also classified as “dangerous goods,” requiring additional permits and fees. Cryoport’s cryogenic solutions on the other hand are classified as non-hazardous. Additionally, cobbled together systems with assets and technologies managed by multiple entities introduces gaps in the compliance platform of the offering which in turn creates inherent material risks during the storage, fulfillment, and/or transport processes.

Through our experience, we know that the logistics distribution process can have a large impact on product/commodity conditions. This is especially important for the high value and at times irreplaceable commodities that we transport, whether in support of a clinical trial or the commercial distribution of a product. We therefore go beyond traditional ISTA (International Safe Transit Association) packaging validation and have implemented Quality-by-Design processes that allow us to assess in-field events, the impact of logistics on the commodity being shipped, and the equipment being used for each individual shipment. With the acquisition of CRYOPDP, Cryoport now has more control and accountability around the logistics distribution which in turn provides better performance and risk management for our clients and their critical therapies.
We have been qualified as a trusted temperature-controlled solutions provider for hundreds of life sciences companies, institutions, and governments and, as of December 31, 2021, supported over 602 clinical trials in the regenerative medicine space. Cryoport and CRYOPDP have logged over 500,000 shipments to over 100 countries with hundreds of different types of life sciences materials in the last 12 months alone. Our experience and reputation, combined with decades of know-how and technology, provides us with significant competitive advantages. As an example, Novartis, Kite Pharmaceuticals Inc. (a subsidiary of Gilead Sciences), Bluebird Bio, Orchard Therapeutics, and Bristol Myers Squibb have all entrusted Cryoport to manage their respective global clinical shipments of gene and cell therapies trials and the commercial shipments of their respective therapies, KYMRIAH®, YESCARTA®, TECARTUS™, BREYANZI®, ABECMA®, LIBMELDY™, and ZYNTEGLO™. Cryoport is now supporting eight commercially approved products in the regenerative medicine space.
Cryoport Systems’ Cryoportal® logistics management platform (“Cryoportal”) is an important backbone technology that is integrated with our partners like FedEx, UPS, DHL, McKesson, Be-The-Match Biotherapies, Lonza, and others. The Cryoportal® handles order entry, keeps track of our global inventory, and provides algorithms for predictive analysis on every shipment while in transit, globally. Our customer service team monitors every shipment 24/7/365 while they are in transit and, by leveraging the Cryoportal, they have the unique ability to see issues that arise and take corrective measures up to and including intervention to save a shipment when needed. 
Embedded within the Cryoportal® is the Chain of Compliance®, which is important for regulatory reasons and for risk mitigation. Using our Chain of Compliance®, every Cryoport Express® and ELITE™ shipper has its unique ID, every SmartPak® condition monitoring system has a unique ID, everything that is used more than once has a unique ID that is attached to it for its entire life. Thereby, Cryoport personnel can pull any shipper out of our inventory and tell the customer its entire history including every journey it has taken, for whom it was shipped, the contents shipped, the Cryoport shipper’s performance during transit, and the time of its return to a Cryoport Systems Global Logistics facility. It then continues to provide information on who performed the validated cleaning process, who recertified the unite and its components, and who recalibrated the SmartPak®, and who recertified it as being acceptable for its next use. All this traceability is stored in our Cryoportal® for our clients to access at any time. We are unaware of any other company that provides this solution. 
In October 2020, we made two acquisitions: CRYOPDP and MVE. The CRYOPDP acquisition, in October 2020, added 25 facilities located in 14 countries to Cryoport bringing us to a total of 33 facilities in 15 countries. Our network of logistics centers provides redundancies for safety and certainty and enables us to be closer to our clients. It is our goal to have facilities within close proximity to global cell and gene manufacturing sites. With the CRYOPDP acquisition we instantly expanded our global network to cover most of the important locations. CRYOPDP and Cryoport Systems have already initiated the process of establishing jointly run facilities when appropriate to provide additional efficiencies and flexibility to our mutual client base. The first facilities that are jointly run include Osaka, Japan, Singapore, and Morris Plains, NJ.
Approximately eight years ago Cryoport Systems outsourced the manufacturing of the Cryoport Express® cryogenic dewars to the MVE, then a division of Chart Industries. At the time, Cryoport selected MVE because we felt that they were the best at cryogenic manufacturing, produced the highest quality products, and could scale to meet our volume requirements over time. By acquiring MVE, Cryoport became vertically integrated with the leading provider of cryogenic systems in the world and we secured one of our primary strategic inventory sources, which assures us of our ability to scale and further develop our Chain of Compliance® .
Today, Cryoport is the leading temperature-controlled supply chain solutions company serving the life sciences industry with a focus on the fast-paced cell and gene therapies market. In regenerative medicine, we support the major share of clinical trials; we support the most commercial therapies; we have a global logistics of network of 33 facilities, and we own the largest cryogenic systems manufacturing company for the life sciences in the world. We are forecasting a record number of regenerative therapies to file for approval this year and the cell and gene market is expected to grow rapidly for the next decade and beyond. We think Cryoport is well positioned to benefit from that growth -- today and for years to come.

The Markets We Serve
Cryoport serves the life sciences industry as a trusted provider of integrated temperature-controlled supply-chain solutions supporting the biopharma/pharma, animal health, and reproductive medicine markets.
Biopharma/Pharma. In the biopharma/pharma market, we are focused on supporting the saving of lives. From clinical research and development to clinical research organizations, to clinical trials for cell and gene therapies, to the storage and delivery of life-saving commercial cell and gene therapies, to the customers of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations, to crucial points of care, we strive to address fundamental-to-advanced temperature-controlled storage, transport, packaging, fulfillment, and information challenges. Cell and gene therapies have become a rapidly growing area of biological drug development, with over $23.1 billion in funding raised in 2021 and 1,129 industry-sponsored, global clinical trials underway as of the third quarter of 2021, as reported by the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine in their 2022 Cell & Gene State of the Industry Briefing in January 2022. These therapeutic approaches have certain supply chain challenges that we believe our solutions are well tailored to address. 

● | Cell Therapies. As per the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, Cell therapy is “the administration of viable, often purified cells into a patient’s body to grow, replace, or repair damaged tissue for the treatment of a disease. A variety of different types of cells can be used in cell therapy, including hematopoietic (blood-forming) stem cells, skeletal muscle stem cells, neural stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells (adult stem cells that differentiate into structures as connective tissues, blood, lymphatics, bone, and cartilage), lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and pancreatic islet cells. Cell therapies may be autologous, meaning that the patient receives cells from their own body, or they may be allogenic, meaning the patient receives cells from a donor. Allogeneic cell therapies are often referred to as “off-the-shelf” therapies, as they are derived from a donor who is not the patient, enabling advance preparation and available to the patient immediately at the time of need.”
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cryoport has been focused on the cell and gene therapy market for the last seven (7) years. In that time, we have successfully established ourselves as a premier provider of supply chain solutions and now support 602 clinical trials and 8 commercial programs in the space. Our solutions have been developed to specifically support this space and offer the highest level of temperature control and visibility within the market. Additionally, Cryoport has developed its Chain of Compliance™ platform that has been specifically developed to support irreplaceable clinical and commercial therapies and of which many of the critical requirements are featured in the recently released ISO 21973 guidance issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) which specifically outlines General Requirement for Transportation of Cells for Therapeutic Use.

● | Gene Therapies. As per the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, “Gene therapy seeks to modify or introduce genes into a patient’s body with the goal of durably treating, preventing, or potentially even curing disease, including several types of cancer, viral diseases, and inherited disorders.” These therapies often cost more than $1,000,000 per patient and are irreplaceable. Significant funding has been committed to this space with more than $10.6 billion in funding in 2021. Cryoport has developed its ELITE™ -80°C shipper line to support this space as a best-in-class product.

Segment Reporting
The Company continually monitors and reviews its segment reporting structure in accordance with authoritative guidance to determine whether any changes have occurred that would impact its reportable operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. The chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is our Chief Executive Officer. Up until the fourth quarter of 2020, we managed, reported and evaluated our business in the following two reportable operating segments: Global Logistics Solutions and Global Bioservices. During the fourth quarter of 2020, our CODM changed how he makes operating decisions, assesses the performance of the business and allocates resources in a manner that caused our operating segments to change as a result of the MVE Biological Solutions and CRYOPDP acquisitions. In consideration of Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), Segment Reporting, we determined that we are not organized around specific products and services, geographic regions or regulatory environments. Accordingly, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2020 we realigned our reporting structure, resulting in a single reportable segment. The Company has adjusted its financial statements for historical periods to reflect this change in segment reporting and show its financial results without segments for all periods presented. See Part II, Item 7 – Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Customers and Distribution
As a result of growing globalization, including in such areas as biologics, biopharma, biotechnology, clinical trials, distribution of biopharmaceutical products and reproductive medicine, the requirement for effective and reliable solutions for keeping clinical samples, pharmaceutical products and other specimen at controlled temperatures takes on added significance due to more sophisticated supply chain challenges including complex shipping routes, extended shipping times, potential custom delays, general logistics challenges, distribution and storage requirements. We believe that our platform of solutions, expertise and geographic footprint enables us to take advantage of the growing demand for effective and efficient international transport and storage of temperature sensitive life sciences commodities and products. This is especially the case for the new therapies being developed in the regenerative medicine market, such as autologous and allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies, that require cryogenic temperatures to maintain safety and efficacy.
No single customer accounted for over 10% of our total revenues during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Two customers accounted for 24.1% and 12.8% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our geographical revenues, by origin, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were as follows:

Customer types
Cryoport is a global leader in serving the life sciences industry as a trusted provider of integrated temperature-controlled supply-chain solutions supporting the biopharma/pharma, animal health, and reproductive medicine markets. Our major customer types include:
Clinical Trials - Every pharmaceutical or biotech company developing a new drug or therapy must seek development protocol approval by regulatory bodies, e.g., the FDA or EMA. Usually, these agencies require clinical trials to be designed to test the safety and efficacy of the potential new drug or therapy among other things. In connection with the clinical trials, due to globalization, companies may enroll patients from all over the world and may need to regularly submit a blood or other specimen at the local hospital, doctor’s offices or laboratories. Generally, these samples are then sent to specified testing laboratories, which may be local or in another country. In addition, the therapies used by the patients may require biostorage and time critical and/or temperature-controlled shipping to the sites of the clinical trials. Importantly, clinical trial specimens are often irreplaceable because each one represents clinical data at a prescribed point in time, in a series of specimens on a given patient, who may be participating in a trial for years. Sample integrity during the logistics process is vital to retaining the maximum number of patients in each trial and keeping the trial on schedule. Requirements can also include the return and destruction of these investigational medicinal products. Clinical trial support involves a full ecosystem of Clinical Research Organizations (“CRO”) and requires flexible and highly qualified end-to-end supply chain solutions for which we ideally suited.
Biotechnology and Diagnostic Companies - The biotechnology market includes basic and applied research and development in diverse areas such as stem cells, gene therapy, DNA tumor vaccines, tissue engineering, genomics, blood products, etc. Companies participating in the foregoing fields rely on the frozen storage and temperature-controlled transport of specimens in connection with their research and development efforts, for which our suite of supply chain solutions are ideally suited.
Cell Therapy Companies - Rapid advancements are underway in the research and development of cell-based therapies, which involve cellular material being infused into a patient. In allogeneic cell therapies, the donor is a different person than the recipient of the cells. Autologous cell therapy is a personalized therapeutic intervention that uses an individual’s cells, which are cultured and expanded outside the body, and reintroduced into the individual. Once cells are manufactured into a cellular therapy, in either case, they must be stored and shipped cryogenically for which our Cryoport Express® and Cryoport ELITE™ Shipper solutions, CRYOPDP solutions, CRYOGENE biostorge, and MVE Biological Solutions’ stainless steel cryogenic freezers and aluminum dewars are ideally suited.
Contract Research, Development & Manufacturing Companies - Increasingly, as evidenced by our strategic partnership with Lonza, CRO’s, and Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (“CDMO’s”) are engaging our services exclusively in conjunction with their contract services platform in order to provide a higher level of service to our mutual client base. We anticipate that these relationships, which are mutually beneficial to both parties as well as our client base, will accelerate and expand to include our entire portfolio of services as cell and gene therapy clinical trials advances and as commercial therapies ramp on a global basis.
Central Laboratories - With the increase and globalization of clinical studies and trials, logistics have become more complex and ensuring sample integrity has become more challenging. International courier costs are now consuming an increasing portion of global protocol budgets; however, central laboratories are also looking for reliability, thus we believe laboratories performing the testing of samples collected during the conduct of these global multi-site studies are looking for cost effective, reliable state-of-the-art supply chain solutions. CRYOPDP’s global network of logistic centers have successfully supported central laboratories throughout the world for many years. 
Pharmaceutical or Therapy Distribution - The current focus for our products and solutions also includes the area of bio-pharmaceutical supply chain. There are a significant number of therapeutic therapies currently or anticipated soon to be undergoing clinical trials. After the FDA or regional or national authorities in EMEA or APAC approve them for commercial marketing, it will be necessary for the manufacturers to have a reliable and economical method of bio-storage and distribution to the physician who will administer the product to the patient. We believe it is likely that the most efficient and reliable method of distribution will be to ship a single dosage to the administering physician. These therapies are typically identified to individual patients and therefore will require a complete tracking history from the manufacturer to the patient. The most reliable method of doing this is to ship a unit dosage specifically for each patient. If such therapies require temperature-controlled logistics, we can provide the technology to meet this need. This supply chain management also includes the support of Managed Access Programs, whereby patients with serious diseases sometimes require specific therapies that are not yet available and/or approved by local regulatory authorities.

Fertility Clinics and IVF. Maintaining cryogenic temperatures during shipping and transfer of in vitro fertilization specimens like eggs, sperm, or embryos is critical for cell integrity to retain viability, stabilize the cells, and ensure reproducible results and successful IVF treatment. We believe that Cryoport Systems solutions for this market, branded as CryoStork® services, are very compelling and well received. Additionally, MVE supplies stainless steel cryogenic freezers to fertility clinics that wish to store reproductive materials on site. The Assisted Reproductive Technology (“ART”) industry is also starting to undergo a significant change due to the consolidation of clinic networks into large corporations or venture backed organizations, which we believe will allow us to further build out our leadership position and set industry standards.
Animal Health Companies. The global animal health market is largely driven by a significant rise in the zoonotic and food-borne diseases globally. This unprecedented disease prevalence has encouraged companies to produce advanced vaccines and pharmaceuticals. The high demand has also resulted in the subsequent rise in the number of companies making consistent efforts to control risks of pathogen contamination and food-borne diseases, which is contributing to market growth. In addition to food animal production, companion animal support is another emerging area in which companies are investing heavily. Cryoport’s MVE products, Cryoport Systems and CRYOPDP temperature-controlled supply chain solutions are well positioned to support storage and distribution needs of breeders, large-scale repositories, veterinary laboratories, and artificial insemination, particularly in the beef and dairy industries on a global basis. 
University Research Facilities. Research is conducted globally at major universities. Often this is done in collaboration with others which requires shipping using Cryoport Express® Shippers or CRYOPDP services. When in storage, we believe storage at cryogenic temperatures provides the most secure long-term storage for high value samples. Our broad line of products provides solutions tailored to institutions and individual researchers as exemplified by CRYOGENE.
Sales and Marketing
We serve clients throughout the life sciences industries and our sales and marketing initiatives are global in nature, focusing on addressing each customer’s pain points and anticipated needs through best-in-class supply chain solutions. Our business development teams have resources in the Americas, EMEA and the APAC regions to proactively support our customers and to ensure efficient business development with respect to the customer’s geographic activity, size and decision-making structure. Our marketing teams design and implement targeted digital campaigns to support our commercial strategy and promote our innovative portfolio of solutions and capabilities. Our marketing initiatives are designed to drive our business development, program management, consulting, other related activities and increase awareness of our advanced temperature-controlled supply chain solutions. Given the global nature of our business and the high focus on customer development and acquisition, we plan to continue to extend our sales and marketing team’s reach in the Americas, EMEA and the APAC regions by further strengthening our marketing initiatives, hiring additional resources, and expanding our distributor and alliance network.
Competition
We believe Cryoport is unique in its offering, and we have not identified any competition that offers solutions that are as comprehensive or as in depth as our platform of temperature-controlled supply chain solutions and that has been proven in the global market to the same extent as our solutions have. However, we do have competition from companies that offer products and/or services that could be considered competitive to certain components or elements of our platform of solutions include specialty couriers, such as World Courier Group, Inc., Marken, Biocair and Quick Life Science Group along with companies that offer products such as Biolife Solutions, Azenta Life Sciences, Cytiva, and IC Biomedical. In addition, life science companies may develop their own in-house temperature-controlled supply chain solutions, systems and procedures to cover their needs.

Engineering and Development
Our research, development and engineering efforts are focused on continually investigating new technologies that can improve our services and improving the features of our products and solutions, which includes our cloud-based Cryoportal® Logistics Management Platform, Cryoport Express® and Cryoport ELITE™ Shippers, secondary packaging solutions, our SmartPak condition monitoring system, technology used to enhance our specialty courier solutions, as well as our advanced line of stainless-steel freezers, aluminum dewars and related ancillary equipment used in the storage and transport of life sciences commodities. These efforts are expected to lead to, based on market requirements, the introduction of additional systems and features, including dewars and other shippers of varying sizes and for various temperature ranges, bio-storage units of varying sizes and for varying ranges, further advanced informatics, and improved monitoring systems. We are continuously researching alternative and new technologies, lower cost materials, utilization of higher volume assembly methods, improved manufacturing methods and enabling technologies that will make it practical to provide a wider range of effective and advanced solutions. Some of these developments are further described under ‘Cryoport Products and Services’ further above.
Innovation
Supporting critical supply chain demands within the cell therapy space requires unique, dedicated temperature-controlled systems and processes. Applying traditional logistics methodology in support of cell therapies is often ineffective. Cryoport continues to develop a dedicated supply-chain platform specifically tailored to cell therapy storage, fulfillment, and distribution requirements. It is anchored by our Chain of Compliance® ISO 21973 compliant platform and supported by industry leading processes, technology, and experience. Critical to the advancement of our supply-chain platform is the ability to develop and launch market leading technologies, systems, and processes that continually improve the management of risk, provide the ability to scale, and enable our clients to focus on the development and manufacturing of their critical therapies and treatments.

They are specifically tailored to the needs of both autologous and allogeneic cell therapies, gene therapies, RNA therapies, and vaccines. We believe these first of their kind global supply chain centers are the beginning of a distinguishing global network that will offer unique advantages to the advancement of the regenerative medicine market.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
Manufacturing. We source components for our products from multiple suppliers, including those that manufacture to our engineering specifications, using, in part, proprietary technology and know-how to mitigate supply chain risks. We also use “off-the-shelf” products, which we may modify to meet our requirements. For some components, there are relatively few alternate sources of supply and the establishment of additional or replacement suppliers may or may not be accomplished immediately. When this occurs, we endeavor to mitigate risk by locating an alternative qualified supplier and, as appropriate, increasing our inventory level. For additional information see the “Risk Factors” section of this document. 
Our vendor/partner relationships allow us to concentrate on further advancing and expanding our platform of systems, products, and solutions for the life sciences to meet the growing and varied demands for validated temperature-controlled solutions in the life sciences industry. We endeavor to keep our supply structure up to date and agile as it provides us the opportunity to rapidly scale to support our client’s commercialization, systems, products, and solutions requirements; however, we are ever mindful of the work we must do to improve our current sourcing and to continue to mitigate risks therein. 
Raw Materials. Various raw materials are used in the manufacture of our products and in the development of our technologies. Most raw materials are generally available from several alternate distributors and/or manufacturers. Where we have experienced significant difficulty in obtaining these raw materials, we have established alternative global sources or are working with the existing supplier to overcome its deficiency.

Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights
To remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection on the proprietary aspects of our platform of technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. 
We file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research, development and design. We currently own approximately 32 issued patents and have more than 50 pending patent applications throughout the world. Our patents generally protect certain aspects of our products and related technology. We also own common law and registered trademarks in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries to protect the names of our company, certain products, and key service brands. We own certain copyrights relating to certain aspects of our systems, products and services.
Our success is influenced, in part, by our ability to continue to develop proprietary products and technologies. It is desirable to obtain patent coverage for these products and technologies; however, some are protected as trade secrets. We intend to file trademark and patent applications covering any newly developed products, methods and technologies. However, there can be no guarantee that any of our pending or future filed applications will be issued as patents or registered as trademarks. There can be no guarantee that the various patent and trademark governmental agencies from around the world or some third party will not initiate an interference proceeding involving any of our pending applications or issued patents. Finally, there can be no guarantee that our issued patents or future issued patents, if any, will provide adequate protection from competition.
Patents provide some degree of protection for our proprietary technology. However, the pursuit and assertion of patent rights involve complex legal and factual determinations and, therefore, are characterized by significant uncertainty. In addition, the laws governing patent issuance and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve. Moreover, the patent rights we possess or are pursuing generally cover our technologies to varying degrees. As a result, we cannot ensure that patents will issue from any of our patent applications, or that any of the issued patents will offer meaningful protection. In addition, our issued patents may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or rendered unenforceable so that our patent rights may not create an effective barrier to competition. We must also pay maintenance fees at set intervals for our patents to not expire prematurely. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that any patents issued to us will provide a legal basis for establishing an exclusive market for our products or provide us with any competitive advantages, or that patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business or to continue to use our technologies freely. As with all patents, we may be subject to third parties filing claims that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert such claims against us or whether those claims will hurt our business. If we are forced to defend against such claims, regardless of their merit, we may face costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention and resources. As a result of any such disputes, we may have to develop, at a substantial cost, non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements may be unavailable on terms acceptable to such third parties, or at all, which could seriously harm our business or financial condition.
With respect to our trademarks, we file and pursue trademark registrations on words, symbols, logos, and other source identifiers that clients use to associate our products and services with us. Although our registered trademarks carry a presumption of validity, they can be challenged and possibly invalidated and as such, we cannot guarantee that any trademark registration is infallible.
We also rely on trade secret protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and third parties, although, in the past, we have not always obtained such agreements. It is possible that these agreements may be breached, invalidated, or rendered unenforceable, and if so, our trade secrets could be disclosed to our competitors. Despite the measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property, parties to such agreements may breach confidentiality provisions in our contracts or infringe or misappropriate our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. In addition, third parties may independently discover or invent competitive technologies, or reverse engineer our trade secrets or other technology. Therefore, the measures we are taking to protect our proprietary technology may not be adequate.

Cryoport’s Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs Programs
Cryoport is committed to quality, and this is reflected in all aspects of our global organization. From our innovative design of products and services to our continuous improvement initiatives, Cryoport has implemented comprehensive quality standards that match or exceed the stringent requirements within the markets we serve. Cryoport’s Quality Management Systems have been designed, implemented, and certified to meet ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 13485 standards in key global locations, demonstrating the discipline necessary to maintain a positive compliance profile. With our strong foundation in ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 13485, we leverage industry-specific experience with applicable regulatory requirements, and industry expectations, to create processes and procedures that incorporate strong operational practices of checks with verification. Our Quality Management Systems are designed to ensure proper controls in logistics, customer/client education, contracting, processing, shipping and storage, accumulation, and communication. Providing each customer with the proper information, monitoring, and data collection to support Chain of Compliance, Chain of Custody and Chain of Condition, culminating in the successful completion of each transaction or shipment within regulatory requirements.
Our Quality Management Systems incorporate notable good practice quality guidelines and regulations (GxP) elements, beyond those stipulated in ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 13485, to ensure our customers are supported in the manner necessary to maintain standards and to secure a positive compliance profile for Cryoport as a supplier and partner. Notable elements include, but are not limited to, Good Documentation Practices, Good Distribution Practices, Archival processes and procedures, Supplier Controls, and Corrective Action and Preventive Action (CAPA) procedures, to highlight a few examples.
Through procedural requirements, Cryoport provides substantial risk-mitigation strategies throughout its full offering of products, systems, and services to support and maintain customer confidence. Metrics and Key Performance Indicators are accumulated regularly, and are trended to predict, and mitigate, potential risks to operations. Senior management utilized this information to enact decisions regarding procedures, processes, resource allocation, and corrective actions. Quality-driven initiatives are supported throughout our global organization. In addition, Cryoport’s manufacturing operations are ISO 13485 certified as medical manufacturing facilities and are audited for compliance on a regular basis by authorized authorities. We are also subject to GMED, which is an international reference body in the certification of health care and medical devices quality management systems under ISO 9001, NF EN ISO 13485 and ISO 13485. As such, we are subject to audits buy a Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) auditing organization. Cryoport’s cryogenic storage facilities are routinely inspected by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and The Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT) to confirm regulatory compliance to industry requirements related to drug applications, filings, and maintenance of various cryogenically stored materials.
Government Regulation
Globally, Cryoport is subject to numerous domestic federal, state, and local laws and regulations as well as international regulations relating to shipments, customs, import, export, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. In addition, we must ensure compliance with economic sanctions and/or restrictions on individuals, corporations, or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade that may apply to our international cross border business activities. 
The shipping of biologic products, biologic commodities, diagnostic specimens, infectious substances, and dangerous goods, whether via air or ground, falls under the jurisdiction of many state, federal and international agencies. The quality of the packaging that protects such entities is critical in determining successful shipping conditions and to ensure a commodity will arrive at its destination in a satisfactory condition. Meeting stringent regulations such as Dangerous Goods Regulations, ISTA, and IATA, as applicable, Cryoport has demonstrated compliance and adhesion to these requirements. Many of the regulations for transporting dangerous goods in the United States are determined by international rules formulated under the auspices of the United Nations. Dangerous goods are typically one-time shipments and are not a part of our routine services. When called upon to ship dangerous goods, Cryoport follows strict and stringent guidelines. International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) is the United Nations organization that develops regulations (Technical Instructions) for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air. If shipment is by air, compliance with the rules established by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) is required. IATA is a trade association made up of airlines and air cargo couriers that publishes annual editions of the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations. These regulations interpret and add to the ICAO Technical Instructions to reflect industry practices. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) has regulations (published in the Code of Federal Regulations) for interstate shipping of specimens.

18



Our Cryoport Express® and ELITE™ Shippers meet Packing Instructions 602 and 650 and are certified for the shipment of Class 6.2 Dangerous Goods per the requirements of the ICAO Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air and IATA. Our present and planned future versions of the Cryoport SmartPak™ Condition Monitoring Systems will likely be subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), IATA and possibly other agencies which may be difficult to determine on a global basis. Additionally, our Chain of Compliance™ processes comply fully with ISO 21973 recommendations. 
Storage of biological materials that are classified as drug products for human therapeutic use (either for investigational use or commercially approved) or materials used in the manufacture of drug products for human therapeutic use, is regulated by the FDA under Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (“CFR”) part 210 & 211. Facilities must be compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) regulations which are enforced by the FDA through registration and audit. When drug products are exported to other countries, storage upon receipt must meet relevant local regulations.
Our MVE Biological Solutions cryogenic stainless-steel freezers and aluminum dewars are certified to the Medical Device Directive (MDD) in the European Union. Additionally, registrations for import are in place for various countries with these requirements.
For additional information, See “Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters” in this Form 10-K.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
Beginning in 2020 we initiated a formal internal evaluation of our ESG policies, procedures, and performance. Subsequently in February 2021, we publicly disclosed ESG information based on the framework and standards set by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Building upon our first report, we began with the goal of developing a formal, thoughtful, comprehensive, and right-sized sustainability program that would be used as a foundation for effectively organizing, reporting, and measuring our performance to set ESG goals in the future.
In June of 2021, we began a materiality assessment to guide our overall sustainability strategy. The intent of the materiality assessment was to understand what ESG topics were important to our key stakeholders, to take into consideration Cryoport’s business strategy development, and to understand Cryoport’s global internal priorities. There were three key activities for this phase of the process:
​
​
The information and feedback received from the materiality assessment was aggregated into a customized and weighted materiality matrix. The following Materiality Matrix follows GRI Standards recommendations and plots topics based on their relative priority resulting from the materiality assessment.

Once the Materiality Matrix was developed, several meetings were conducted internally with our ESG committee and our Board of Directors’ Nomination and Governance Committee to evaluate the findings.
Cryoport Materiality Matrix
​
​

20



Leveraging the outcomes of the materiality assessment, Cryoport’s Sustainability Strategy was developed to establish focus and a consistent approach to sustainability across the business. Cryoport’s Sustainability Framework defines our overarching vision and mission statements with supporting pillars and corresponding focus areas, as demonstrated below.
​
Environmental
As Cryoport continues to grow its business in a way that is considerate of our global community, we are committed to protecting our planet by using our world’s resources sensibly and minimizing our emissions and waste on a global basis. From an environmental standpoint, one example of our sustainability efforts is our cryogenic Cryoport Express® Shipper, which uses the non-hazardous dry vapor form of liquid nitrogen and proprietary informatics to drive efficiencies in the use of resources throughout our company. This service offering also employs multi-use and recyclable packaging. Knowing that there is much more to do to aid in our environmental efforts, we have recently developed a system to collect data on a global scale for the purpose of quantifying the impact of all our environmental initiatives so that we can demonstrate our achievements on this important matter to our shareholders, customers and other interested stakeholders.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGs)
As we proceed on our ESG journey in 2022, our initial key focus will be on GHG Emissions. GHG emissions were the foremost priority identified in our Materiality Matrix and represent a clear global significance for companies, consumers, and other stakeholders. 

21



Cryoport engaged an ESG advisor upon completion of our Sustainability Strategy to assist in determing our carbon footprint. Through this engagement, we will define our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission sources, collect and compile relevant data to quantify our emissions, and establish a carbon accounting methodology in accordance with the GHG Protocol. The outcome will be a baseline carbon footprint for Cryoport and the ability to execute consistent carbon accounting in the future. These tools will enable us to identify key opportunities to implement targeted projects that will drive GHG emissions reductions in the future. One means of reducing our carbon footprint is procurement of electricity from GHG emissions free resources for our biostorage plant in Houston, Texas. Procurement of GHG emissions free electricity has translated to a significant reduction in carbon emissions compared to energy provided by coal-fired power plants. In 2021, the Houston plant consumed 4,489,987 kWh of electricity. By utilizing electricity from GHG emissions free resources, the emission of 1,440,257 pounds of GHGs was avoided. This emissions savings is the equivalent of removing 242 passenger vehicles driven for one year.
Resource Efficiency
Cryoport understands the importance of resource conservation as it relates to the efficient use of resources, reduction of our carbon footprint, and effective cost management. To that end, Cryoport strives to operate in an efficient manner to ensure the optimization of raw materials, equipment, waste, energy and labor. We have identified thermal efficiency as the largest impact on energy conservation associated with our products. To manage this aspect of the business, our Global Logistics Center Network utilizes the International Safe Transit Association (ISTA) standard 7E to test and evaluate thermal performance against stated requirements of 10+ days of maintaining internal temperatures at or below negative 150oC. Our products comply with this standard, and in turn, the products insulative properties require less energy to maintain prescribed temperature levels.
Cryoport’s dewars do not consume any electricity, and our freezer units utilize liquid nitrogen as a cooling agent, which is the by-product of other processes, creating a closed-loop resource that reduces additional energy associated with sourcing, procuring, and delivery of resources purchased from third parties. In 2021, our use of liquid nitrogen freezers, when compared to the energy consumption of a standard -150OC mechanical freezer, prevented the consumption of 1,883,136 kWh of electricity, equivalent to 1,725,871 pounds of GHG emissions avoided. 
We also exemplify efficiency through the development and use of the cryogenic Cryoport Express® Shipper, which uses the non-hazardous dry vapor form of liquid nitrogen and proprietary informatics to drive efficiencies in the use of resources throughout our company. Our Cryoport Express® Shipper is also a multi-use offering with recyclable packaging. 
In addition, Cryoport measures the effectiveness and efficiency of our production practices by tracking the amount of scrap material disposed of or sold on an annual basis. Stainless steel products that do not meet our stringent specification are reworked into our process to create new products that meet specifications, diverting the material from landfill and scrap recycling for beneficial reuse as new product. Any scrap metal that does not meet specification and cannot effectively be reworked into new product is recycled by third party recycling partners. 
Further, in 2021 our Paris, France operations moved into a new facility, which is designed with the highest French environmental standards and equipped with solar panels to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions. Overall, our efforts in these areas, among others not highlighted, have a positive environmental outcome for Cryoport and its customers.
Supporting Our People
Cryoport’s global team of employees are our most valuable resource, from our teams on the front line in our global supply chain and logistics centers, to our manufacturing operations, to our business development personnel, to the engineers who design our products and services, to our quality assurance and regulatory teams that assure the safety, quality, compliance, and integrity of our products.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)
We are committed to inclusion, equity and diverse representation for our employees across our Company. Cryoport is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer and currently tracks gender distribution across its operations and management. We maintain clear policies related to anti-harassment, discrimination and retaliation, and provide an anonymous, third party-managed reporting hotline for employees to report incidents of harassment, discrimination, and policy violations. In 2021, we further enhanced our online corporate training programs related to diversity, harassment and discrimination, so that employees receive annual training on the topics of 

22



harassment, diversity and inclusion, business ethics and code of conduct. In addition, Cryoport’s recruiting programs include targeted outreach to a variety of under-represented constituents, including minorities, women, veterans, and disabled populations to help improve recruiting efforts while gaining valuable insights from a diverse set of recruits. Cryoport has partnered with or targeted organizations like Hire Heroes, Career OneStop, recruiting at Historical Black Colleges, Accounting and Financial Women’s Alliance, and Women in Technology. 
Cryoport understands that the manufacturing industry is typically male-dominated. In an effort to open opportunities for more female roles within our organization, Cryoport currently tracks gender distribution across operations. As of December 2021, women represented a total of approximately 30% of all employees, with approximately 18% of manager and 8% of directors being women. Senior leadership positions, at Vice President and above, currently sits as approximately 2%. Based on this data, Cryoport understands that there is work to be done to create a more equitable and representative senior leadership team and continue to push gender diversity throughout its operations.
Employee Health & Safety
Cryoport’s Employee Health & Safety (EHS) programs have resulted in strong safety performance, as demonstrated by our total injury rate (TIR) and lost time injury rate (LTIR) being significantly lower than the global industry averages. Facilitated by our culture of continuous improvement, we are committed to continue to work toward reducing our TIR and LTIR numbers even further.
We have implemented flexible working arrangements, including telecommuting and part time arrangements, in order to maintain a safe working environment for our employees throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
Innovating Responsibly
Cryoport recognizes the role we play in protecting the health and safety of current and future generations through services and solutions that promote sustainability, resilience, and respect for the environment. We strive for a product base that is of the highest quality and with long use phases to minimize impact associated with production of new product, and Cryoport reviews opportunities to eliminate materials of concern and related managed waste streams on a regular cadence.
Product & Service Quality
As a temperature-controlled supply chain provider to the life sciences industry, Cryoport must comply with the safe transportation of regulated hazardous materials. As a result, we have designed and developed several features in its various products to comply with US DOT, IATA, ICAO, and other regulatory and guidance bodies. Additionally, safety warnings are included in our product labeling as well as our manuals. Our products are designed to conform to the following standards (where applicable):

● | ISO 13485 (Section 7.3 Design and Development, ISO, QMS)

These standards are woven into our development methodology used to design all new products within the organization. This development process includes a risk management assessment done in accordance with ISO 14971 that identifies hazards and mitigates risks via design improvements, process improvement, and warnings (including labels and safety information shipped with the product). 
We pride ourselves on our exceptional operational quality. Our temperature-controlled supply chain solutions focused on cell and gene therapies boast a 99.89% delivery success rate and due to this performance 13,477 additional patients were able to receive therapies over the past 24 months and 1,334 intended parents are potentially able to have successful cycles resulting in the birth of a child on an annual basis because of our CryoStork® solution. 
While rare, recalls of product may become necessary. The primary responsibility for recall management lies with our Vice President of Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs for manufacturing. The executive staff is involved in decision and implementation processes depending upon the specifics of any recall required. Customer service personnel, sales staff and other resources would then be utilized in reaching all distributors and direct end users. Results of recalls are evaluated daily until the recall is closed. There were no product recalls during 2021.
Product Lifecycle Management
Cryoport creates unique products with long-term use in mind. Cryoport products are primarily constructed of recyclable aluminum or stainless steel and we approach the extension of product lifecycles through the following four areas:

● | Longevity
--+----------


● | Repairability
--+--------------


● | Reusability
--+------------


● | Recyclability
--+--------------

We strive for a product base with long use phases to minimize impact associated with production of new product. At our MVE Biological Solutions production facility, we manufacture fusion freezer units that utilize 1/587 of the energy used by conventional mechanical freezers used for similar applications. For example, our freezer production displaced annual electricity consumption by 139,424,817 kWh from what would otherwise be consumed from alternative products. This amount of electricity could power 11,899 homes (sized at 2,500 square feet) annually. This reduction in energy consumption from our freezer lines alone equates to 123,444,781 pounds of GHG emissions avoided or the emissions equivalent to 21,489 passenger vehicles driven for one year. 
Cryoport regularly reviews opportunities to eliminate the use of materials considered hazardous and related managed waste streams on a regular cadence. Cryoport does not utilize any substances of concern in our products; We do currently utilize minimal quantities of hazardous materials that are not listed substances of concern in our operations, primarily in the form of isopropanol, epoxies, butyl cellosolve, lacquer thinner, paint, hyamine and isopropyl alcohol. These materials and the insignificant quantities of hazardous wastes generated in our production facilities are managed in compliance with all state and federal regulations. Any hazardous waste that is generated is tracked and managed with an overall goal of eliminating hazardous materials where possible. 
Cryoport does not utilize any minerals identified as conflict minerals (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) and makes our best effort to ensure that our suppliers practice responsible sourcing practices, as further detailed in Supplier Management under our Governing Ethically pillar.
Governing Ethically
Cryoport recognizes constructive supplier relationships as essential to our ability to meet customer requirements for quality solutions. We expect our business partners to share our commitment to ethics, integrity, compliance, safety, human rights, data security, and environmental protection. By the same token, as a provider accountable to thousands of companies worldwide, we pledge, through our ESG performance, to meet or exceed our clients’ requirements for the same.
Business Ethics
We are committed to operating with honesty, truthfulness and transparency in accordance to the highest ethical and corporate governance standards – mutual respect, integrity and trust are our foundation. As an ethical operator, we have developed a robust Code of Conduct and hold ourselves accountable to it in all we do. All employees across our operations are provided with training and 

24



reference materials to reinforce this commitment to integrity and ethics in our business. Our policies are clearly defined, published in local languages where applicable, and include guidance on topics including, but not limited to: 

● | Corruption
--+-----------


● | Anti-Trust and Anti-Competitive Behavior
--+-----------------------------------------


● | Insider Dealings
--+-----------------


● | Gifts
--+------


● | Bribes (e.g., explicit prohibition of facilitation payments)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | Conflicts of Interest
--+----------------------


● | Intellectual Property
--+----------------------


● | Compliance
--+-----------


● | Truthful and accurate reporting
--+--------------------------------


● | Interactions with Healthcare professionals
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Whistleblower protections (including non-retaliation)
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | Political Activity and Contributions (e.g., explicit prohibition of contribution of any kind to any candidate or political party without express prior approval of the Board of Directors – this covers both direct contributions and indirection support; no political contributions have been made in recent years)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to our Code of Conduct, our senior leadership team actively oversees the governance of our ethics programs to help ensure that commitment is driven from the top down, and that program owners are accountable for successful program compliance. 
Cryoport does not conduct clinical trials, animal testing or use human tissue of any kind in the manufacture or design of our products, and our Code of Conduct governs the ethical behavior of our employees across Cryoport operations. Further, the Company does not conduct lobbying activities.
Supplier Management
Temperature controlled supply chain support to the life sciences industry is critical to all that Cryoport does; therefore, we take an active approach to managing suppliers and partners to ensure that appropriate compliance, health, safety, labor practices, and ethical standards are employed. Our internal diligence process for third-party vendors including a supplier questionnaire that is required for vendor approval and a regular auditing scheme thereafter for existing suppliers. The questionnaire is intended to verify that programs exist to manage material risk areas associated with the given supplier’s operations and particular consideration is paid to diligencing bribery or other forms of corrupt activity. No suppliers are approved until this mandatory due diligence is complete and a completed assessment form is on file.
As an example of verification that programs exist to manage material risks for any given supplier, if our transportation suppliers employ or work with a Dangerous Goods Safety Advisor, we confirm the presence of a credentialed role responsible for overseeing activities associated with dangerous goods, including but not limited to, employee training and coaching, reporting, and monitoring of activities associated with the transportation of dangerous goods. The purpose of this inquiry is to gauge the degree of oversight over dangerous goods management by our suppliers to help ensure product and employee welfare. 
Our Code of Conduct extends through our suppliers and thus sets an expectation for our suppliers to commit to operating with honesty, truthfulness and transparency in accordance to the highest ethical and corporate governance standards, as Cryoport personifies through our operations. Per our Code of Conduct, Cryoport will not tolerate the use by suppliers of forced labor in any form.
Data Privacy & Security
Cryoport uses an outside Center for Internet Security (CIS) assessment firm to evaluate its data security controls in an effort protect our businesses and secure the information of our employees and customers. The evaluation process utilizes the CIS Critical Security Controls Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) methodology, and is an ongoing initiative used to continuously improve the CMMI rating for the Company.
