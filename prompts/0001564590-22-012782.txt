Overview
 We are a patient-centric gene therapy company focused on developing and commercializing AAV-based gene therapies for the treatment of monogenic diseases of the central nervous system, or CNS, in both rare and large patient populations. We were founded in partnership with The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, or UT Southwestern, to develop and commercialize transformative gene therapy treatments. Together with UT Southwestern, we are advancing a deep and sustainable product portfolio of gene therapy product candidates, with exclusive options to acquire several additional development programs at no cost. By combining our management team’s proven experience in gene therapy drug development and commercialization with UT Southwestern’s world-class gene therapy research capabilities, we believe we have created a powerful engine to develop transformative therapies to dramatically improve patients’ lives. In March 2022, we announced strategic pipeline prioritization initiatives focused on GAN and Rett syndrome. We will conduct small proof-of-concept studies in CLN1 disease and SLC13A5 deficiency. Development of the CLN7 program will continue in collaboration with existing partners with future clinical development to focus on the first-generation construct. All other research and development activities will be paused to increase operational efficiency.
 In April 2021, we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to TSHA-120, a clinical-stage, intrathecally dosed AAV9 gene therapy program for the treatment of giant axonal neuropathy, or GAN. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TSHA-120 is being conducted by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, under an accepted investigational new drug application, or IND. We reported clinical safety and functional MFM32 data from this trial for the highest dose cohort of 3.5x1014 total vg in January 2022, where we saw continued clinically meaningful slowing of disease progression similar to that achieved with the lower dose cohorts, which we considered confirmatory of disease modification. For Rett syndrome, we submitted a CTA filing in November 2021 and announced initiation of clinical development of TSHA-102 under a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) approved by Health Canada in March 2022. We expect to report preliminary clinical data for TSHA-102 in Rett syndrome by year-end 2022. We recently executed an exclusive option from UT Southwestern to license worldwide rights to a clinical-stage CLN7 program. The CLN7 program is currently in a Phase 1 clinical proof-of-concept trial run by UT Southwestern, and we reported preliminary clinical safety data for the first patient in history to be intrathecally dosed at 1.0x1015 total vg with the first-generation construct in December 2021. Development of the CLN7 program will continue in collaboration with existing partners with future clinical development to focus on the first-generation construct. We will conduct small proof-of-concept studies in CLN1 disease and SLC13A5 deficiency that we believe can further validate our platform. We plan to initiate clinical development on TSHA-105 for the treatment of SLC13A5 in 2022.
Our Pipeline
 We are advancing a deep and sustainable product portfolio of gene therapy product candidates for monogenic diseases of the CNS in both rare and large patient populations, with exclusive options to acquire several additional development programs at no cost. Our portfolio of gene therapy candidates targets broad neurological indications across three distinct therapeutic categories: neurodegenerative diseases, neurodevelopmental disorders and genetic epilepsies. Our current pipeline, including the stage of development of each of our product candidates, is represented in the table below.
 


TSHA-120 for Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN)
 In March 2021, we acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to a clinical-stage, intrathecally dosed AAV9 gene therapy program, now known as TSHA-120, for the treatment of giant axonal neuropathy, or GAN, pursuant to a license agreement with Hannah’s Hope Fund for Giant Axonal Neuropathy, Inc., or HHF. Under the terms of the agreement, HHF received an upfront payment of $5.5 million and 
 1


will be eligible to receive clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones totaling up to $19.3 million, as well as a low, single-digit royalty on net sales upon commercialization of TSHA-120.
 GAN is a rare autosomal recessive disease of the central and peripheral nervous systems caused by loss-of-function gigaxonin gene mutations. There are an estimated 5,000 affected GAN patients in addressable markets.
 Symptoms and features of children with GAN usually develop around the age of five years and include an abnormal, wide based, unsteady gait, weakness and some sensory loss. There is often associated dull, tightly curled, coarse hair, giant axons seen on a nerve biopsy, and spinal cord atrophy and white matter abnormality seen on MRI. Symptoms progress and as the children grow older they develop progressive scoliosis and contractures, their weakness progresses to the point where they will need a wheelchair for mobility, respiratory muscle strength diminishes to the point where the child will need a ventilator (usually in the early to mid-teens) and the children often die during their late teens or early twenties, typically due to respiratory failure. There is an early- and late-onset phenotype associated with the disease, with shared physiology. The late-onset phenotype is often categorized as Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 2, or CMT2, with a lack of tightly curled hair and CNS symptoms with relatively slow progression of disease. This phenotype represents up to 6% of all CMT2 diagnosis. In the late-onset population, patients have poor quality of life but the disease is not life-limiting. In early-onset disease, symptomatic treatments attempt to maximize physical development and minimize the rate of deterioration. Currently, there are no approved disease-modifying treatments available. 
 TSHA-120 is an AAV9 self-complementary viral vector encoding the full length human gigaxonin protein. The construct was invented by Dr. Steven Gray and is the first AAV9 gene therapy candidate to deliver a functional copy of the GAN gene under the control of a JeT promoter that drives ubiquitous expression.
 

We have received orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA for TSHA-120 for the treatment of GAN.
 There is an ongoing longitudinal prospective natural history study being led by the NIH, that has already identified and followed a number of patients with GAN for over five years with disease progression characterized by a number of clinical assessments. The GAN natural history study was initiated in 2013 and included 45 patients with GAN, aged 3 to 21 years. Imaging data from this study have demonstrated that there are distinctive increased T2 signal abnormalities within the cerebellar white matter surrounding the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, which represent one of the earliest brain imaging findings in individuals with GAN. These findings precede the more widespread periventricular and deep white matter signal abnormalities associated with advanced disease. In addition, cortical and spinal cord atrophy appeared to correspond to more advanced disease severity and older age. Impaired pulmonary function in patients with GAN also was observed, with forced vital capacity correlating well with several functional outcomes such as the MFM32, a validated 32-item scale for motor function measurement developed for neuromuscular diseases. Nocturnal hypoventilation and sleep apnea progressed over time, with sleep apnea worsening as ambulatory function deteriorated. Total MFM32 score also correlated with ambulatory status, where 
 2


independently ambulant individuals performed better and had higher MFM32 scores than the non-ambulant group, as shown in the graph below.


Patients also reported significant autonomic dysfunction based on the COMPASS 31 self-assessment questionnaire. In addition, nerve conduction function demonstrated progressive sensorimotor polyneuropathy with age. As would be expected for a neurodegenerative disease, younger patients have higher baseline MFM32 scores. However, the rate of decline in the MFM32 scores demonstrated consistency across patients of all ages, with most demonstrating an average 8-point decline per year regardless of age and/or baseline MFM32 score, as shown in the natural history plot below. 
 
A 4-point score change in the MFM32 is considered clinically meaningful, suggesting that patients with GAN lose significant function annually. To date, we have up to eight years of robust data from this study.

Preclinical Data
 TSHA-120 performed well across in vitro and in vivo studies, and demonstrated improved motor function and nerve pathology, and long-term safety across several animal models. Of note, improved dorsal root ganglia, or DRG, pathology was demonstrated in TSHA-120-treated GAN knockout mice. These preclinical results have been published in a number of peer-reviewed journals.
 Additional preclinical data from a GAN knockout rodent model that had received AAV9-mediated GAN gene therapy demonstrated that GAN rodents treated at 16 months performed significantly better than 18-month old untreated GAN rodents and equivalently to controls. These rodents were evaluated using a rotarod performance test which is designed to evaluate endurance, balance, grip strength and motor coordination in rodents. The time to fall off the rotarod, known as latency, was also evaluated and the data below demonstrated the clear difference in latency in treated versus untreated GAN rodents.
 

A result is considered statistically significant when the probability of the result occurring by random chance, rather than from the efficacy of the treatment, is sufficiently low. The conventional method for determining the statistical significance of a result is known as the “p-value,” which represents the probability that random chance caused the result (e.g., a p-value = 0.01 means that there is a 1% probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance). Generally, a p-value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

With respect to DRG inflammation, a topic of considerable interest within the gene therapy arena, the DRG have a significantly abnormal histological appearance and function as a consequence of underlying disease pathophysiology. Treatment with TSHA-120 resulted in considerable improvements in the pathological appearance of the DRG in the GAN knockout mice. Shown below is tissue from a GAN knockout mouse model with numerous abnormal neuronal inclusions containing aggregates of damaged neurofilament in the DRG as indicated by the yellow arrows. On image C, tissue from the GAN knockout mice treated with an intrathecal (IT) injection of TSHA-120 had a notable improvement in the reduction of these neuronal inclusions in the DRG.
 

When a quantitative approach to reduce inclusions in the DRG was applied, it was observed that TSHA-120 treated mice experienced a statistically significant reduction in the average number of neuronal inclusions versus the GAN knockout mice that received vehicle as illustrated below.

Additionally, TSHA-120 demonstrated improved pathology of the sciatic nerve in the GAN knockout mice as shown below.
 

Results of Ongoing Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial
 A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TSHA-120 is being conducted by the NIH under an accepted IND. The ongoing trial is a single-site, open-label, non-randomized dose-escalation trial, in which patients are intrathecally dosed with one of 4 dose levels of TSHA-120 – 3.5x1013 total vg, 1.2x1014 total vg, 1.8x1014 total vg or 3.5x1014 total vg. The primary endpoint is to assess safety, with secondary endpoints measuring efficacy using pathologic, physiologic, functional, and clinical markers. To date, 14 patients have been intrathecally dosed and twelve patients have at least three years’ worth of long-term follow up data.
 At 1-year post-gene transfer, a clinically meaningful and statistically significant slowing or halting of disease progression was seen with TSHA-120 at the highest dose of 3.5x1014 total vg (n=3). The change in the rate of decline in the MFM32 score improved by 5 points in the 3.5x1014 total vg cohort compared to an 8-point decline in natural history.
 

6



Although the change in the MFM32 score was clinically meaningful, we might have expected a greater change in the MFM32 score compared to natural history in the first year but one patient in the high dose cohort was a delayed responder. At the 12-month follow-up visit, the patient had a 7-point decline in the MFM32 total score that was similar to the slope of the natural history curve as shown below. Notably, from Year 1 post gene transfer to Year 2, this patient’s change in the MFM32 score remained unchanged suggesting stabilization of disease at 2 years post-treatment. At that 2-year post treatment timepoint, there was a 9-point improvement in the patient’s MFM32 score compared to the estimated natural history decline of 16 points. The annualized estimate of natural history over time assumes the same rate of decline as in Year 1.
 

7



An additional analysis was performed to examine the change in the rate of decline in the MFM32 score of all therapeutic doses combined (n=12). As shown below, the change in the rate of decline in the MFM32 score improved by 7 points by Year 1 compared to the natural history decline in the MFM32 score of 8 points. This result was clinically meaningful and statistically significant.

A Bayesian analysis was conducted on the 1.2x1014 total vg, 1.8x1014 total vg and 3.5x1014 total vg dose cohorts at Year 1 to assess the probability of clinically meaningful slowing of disease progression as compared to natural history. This type of statistical analysis enables direct probability statements to be made and is both useful and accepted by regulatory agencies in interventional studies of rare diseases and small patient populations. As shown in the table below, for all therapeutic dose cohorts, there was nearly 100% probability of any slowing of disease and a 96.7% probability of clinically meaningful slowing of 50% or more following treatment with TSHA-120 compared to natural history data.
 

8



There remained consistent improvement in TSHA-120’s effect over time on the mean change from baseline in the MFM32 score for all patients in the therapeutic dose cohorts compared to the estimated natural history decline over the years. By Year 3, as depicted below, there was a 10-point improvement in the mean change from baseline in MFM32 score for all patients in the therapeutic dose cohorts.
 


In addition to the compelling three-year data, there was one patient at Year 5 whose MFM32 change from baseline improved by nearly 26-points in the 1.2x1014 total vg dose cohort compared to the estimated natural history decline of 40 points by this timepoint.
 
9



Below is an additional analysis of the mean change from baseline in MFM32 score for the therapeutic dose cohorts compared to natural history at patients’ last visit. As shown, TSHA-120 demonstrated increasing improvement in the mean change in MFM32 score from baseline over time.
 
Secondary Endpoints
 Below is pathology data from biopsies of the superficial radial sensory nerve in 5 out of 6 patient samples analyzed. The remaining patient samples are currently being analyzed. These biopsies confirmed that treatment with TSHA-120 stimulated active regeneration of axons. There was an increase in the number of regenerative clusters observed at Year 1 compared to baseline, indicating active regeneration of nerve fibers following TSHA-120 treatment.

Loss of vision has been frequently cited by patients and caregivers as a symptom they find particularly debilitating and would like to see improvement in following treatment. Patients were analyzed for visual acuity using a standard Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution, or LogMAR. An increase in LogMAR score represents a decrease in visual acuity. A LogMAR score of 0 means normal vision, approximately 0.3 reflects the need for eyeglasses, and a score value of 1.0 reflects blindness. Based on natural history, individuals with GAN experience a progressive loss in visual function as indicated by an increase in the LogMAR score. Ophthalmologic assessments following treatment with TSHA-120 demonstrated preservation of visual acuity over time compared to the loss of visual acuity observed in natural history. Stabilization of visual acuity was observed following treatment with TSHA-120 as demonstrated below.
 

The thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer or RNFL was also examined as an objective biomarker of visual system involvement and overall nervous system degeneration in GAN. Treatment with TSHA-120 resulted in stabilization of RNFL thickness and prevention of axonal nerve degeneration compared to diffuse thinning of RNFL observed in natural history as measured by optical coherence tomography, or OCT. Analysis by individual dose groups, as seen on the graph below, demonstrated relatively stable RNFL thickness which is in contrast to the natural history of GAN, where RNFL decreases. Overall, these data provide new evidence of TSHA-120’s ability to generate nerve fibers and preserve visual acuity.

Safety and Tolerability
 To date, there are 53 patient-years of clinical data to support TSHA-120’s favorable safety and tolerability profile. TSHA-120 has been well-tolerated at multiple doses with no signs of significant acute or subacute inflammation, no sudden sensory changes and no drug-related or persisting transaminitis. Adverse events related to immunosuppression or study procedures were similar to what has been seen with other gene therapies and transient in nature. There was no increase in incidence of adverse events with increased dose. Importantly, TSHA-120 was safely dosed in the presence of neutralizing antibodies as a result of the combination of route of administration, dosing and immunosuppression regimen.
 

Currently in the GAN program, we have up to six years of longitudinal data in individual patients and collectively 53-patient years of clinical safety and efficacy data from our ongoing clinical study. Treatment with TSHA-120 was well-tolerated with no significant safety issues. There was no increase in incidence of adverse events with increased dose, no dose-limiting toxicity, no signs of acute or subacute inflammation, no sudden sensory changes and no drug-related or persistent elevation of transaminases. Adverse events related to immunosuppression or study procedures were similar to what was seen with other gene therapies and transient in nature.
 In September 2021, we submitted a request a Scientific Advice meeting with an ex-US regulatory agency for TSHA-120 and had a meeting in January 2022. Additional discussions with other Health Authorities are planned and regulatory feedback is anticipated mid-2022.
 We have finalized plans for commercial grade material and initiated development of the comparability protocol to support regulatory submissions. An engineering run is currently underway. We anticipate completion of a validation lot by the third quarter of 2022. In addition, we expect to hold discussions with major regulatory agencies focused on the registration pathway for TSHA-120. We will continue our institutional readiness activities, patient identification and maximizing patient access. Lastly, we anticipate several publications of these data by the NIH in collaboration with Taysha.
 TSHA-102 for Rett Syndrome
 TSHA-102, a neurodevelopmental disorder product candidate, is being developed for the treatment of Rett syndrome, one of the most common genetic causes of severe intellectual disability, characterized by rapid developmental regression and in many cases caused by heterozygous loss of function mutations in MECP2, a gene essential for neuronal and synaptic function in the brain. We designed TSHA-102 to prevent gene overexpression-related toxicity by inserting microRNA, or miRNA target binding sites into the 3’ untranslated region of viral genomes. This overexpression of MECP2 is seen in the clinic in patients with a condition known as MECP2 duplication syndrome, where elevated levels of MECP2 result in a clinical phenotype similar to Rett syndrome both in terms of symptoms and severity. TSHA-102 is constructed from a neuronal specific promoter, MeP426, coupled with the miniMECP2 transgene, a truncated version of MECP2, and miRNA-Responsive Auto-Regulatory Element, or miRARE, our novel miRNA target panel, packaged in self-complementary AAV9. Currently, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of Rett syndrome, which affects more than 350,000 patients worldwide, according to the Rett Syndrome Research Trust.

In May 2021, preclinical data from the ongoing natural history study for TSHA-102 were published online in Brain, a highly esteemed neurological science peer-reviewed journal. The preclinical study was conducted by the UT Southwestern Medical Center laboratory of Sarah Sinnett, Ph.D., and evaluated the safety and efficacy of regulated miniMECP2 gene transfer, TSHA-102 (AAV9/miniMECP2-miRARE), via IT administration in adolescent mice between four and five weeks of age. TSHA-102 was compared to unregulated full length MECP2 (AAV9/MECP2) and unregulated miniMECP2 (AAV9/miniMECP2).
 TSHA-102 extended knockout survival by 56% via IT delivery. In contrast, the unregulated miniMECP2 gene transfer failed to significantly extend knockout survival at either dose tested. Additionally, the unregulated full-length MECP2 construct did not demonstrate a significant extension in survival and was associated with an unacceptable toxicity profile in wild type mice.
 In addition to survival, behavioral side effects were explored. Mice were subjected to phenotypic scoring and a battery of tests including gait, hindlimb clasping, tremor and others to comprise an aggregate behavioral score. miRARE attenuated miniMECP2-mediated aggravation in wild type aggregate phenotype severity scores. Mice were scored on an aggregate severity scale using an established protocol. AAV9/MECP2- and AAV9/miniMECP2-treated wild type mice had a significantly higher mean (worse) aggregate behavioral severity score versus that observed for saline-treated mice (p <0.05; at 6–30 and 7–27 weeks of age, respectively). TSHA-102-treated wild type mice had a significantly lower (better) mean aggregate severity score versus those of AAV9/MECP2- and AAV9/miniMECP2-treated mice at most timepoints from 11–19 and 9–20 weeks of age, respectively. No significant difference was observed between saline- and TSHA-102-treated wild type mice.
 miRARE-mediated genotype-dependent gene regulation was demonstrated by analyzing tissue sections from wild type and knockout mice treated with AAV9 vectors given intrathecally. When knockout mice were injected with a vector expressing the mini-MECP2 transgene with and without the miRARE element, miRARE reduced overall miniMECP2 transgene expression compared to unregulated miniMECP2 in wild type mice as shown below.
 

13



TSHA-102 demonstrated regulated expression in different regions of the brain. As shown in the graph and photos below, in the pons and midbrain, miRARE inhibited mean MECP2 gene expression in a genotype-dependent manner as indicated by significantly fewer myc(+) cells observed in wild type mice compared to knockout mice (p<0.05), thereby demonstrating that TSHA-102 achieved MECP2 expression levels similar to normal physiological parameters.
 


In preclinical animal models, intrathecal myc-tagged TSHA-102 was not associated with early death and did not cause adverse behavioral side effects in wild type mice demonstrating appropriate downregulation of miniMECP2 protein expression as compared to unregulated MECP2 gene therapy constructs. In addition, preclinical data demonstrated that miRARE reduced overall expression of miniMECP2 transgene expression and regulated genotype-dependent myc-tagged miniMECP2 expression across different brain regions on a cell-by-cell basis and improved the safety of TSHA-102 without compromising efficacy in juvenile mice. Pharmacologic activity of TSHA-102 following IT administration was assessed in the MECP2 knockout mouse model of Rett syndrome across three dose levels and three age groups (n=252). A one-time IT injection of TSHA-102 significantly increased survival at all dose levels, with the mid to high doses improving survival across all age groups compared to vehicle-treated controls. Treatment with TSHA-102 significantly improved body weight, motor function and respiratory assessments in MECP2 knockout mice. An additional study in neonatal mice is ongoing, and preliminary data suggest normalization of survival. Finally, An IND/CTA-enabling 6-month GLP toxicology study (n=24) examined the biodistribution, toxicological effects and mechanism of action of TSHA-102 when intrathecally administered to NHPs across three dose levels. Biodistribution, as reflected by DNA copy number, was observed in multiple areas of the brain, sections of spinal cord and the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Importantly, mRNA levels across multiple tissues were low, indicating miRARE regulation is minimizing 
 14


transgene expression from the construct in the presence of endogenous MECP2 as expected, despite the high levels of DNA that were delivered. No toxicity from transgene overexpression was observed, confirmed by functional and histopathologic evaluations demonstrating no detrimental change in neurobehavioral assessments and no adverse tissue findings on necropsy.
We have received orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA and orphan drug designation from the European Commission for TSHA-102 for the treatment of Rett syndrome.
 We submitted a CTA for TSHA-102 in November 2021 and announced initiation of clinical development under a CTA approved by Health Canada in March 2022. We expect to report preliminary clinical data for TSHA-102 in Rett syndrome by year-end 2022.
 
TSHA-121 for CLN7 Disease
 The first-generation construct for the CLN7 program was developed in the laboratory of Steven Gray, Ph.D., Associate Professor at UT Southwestern Medical Center and our Chief Scientific Advisor with financial support from Mila’s Miracle and Batten Hope, the leading CLN7 patient advocacy groups. We provided a grant to Batten Hope to support patient awareness, disease education and newborn screening initiatives. We recently executed an exclusive option from UT Southwestern to license worldwide rights to a clinical-stage CLN7 program. The CLN7 program is currently in a Phase 1 clinical proof-of-concept trial run by UT Southwestern, and we reported preliminary clinical safety data for the first patient in history to be intrathecally dosed at 1.0x1015 total vg with the first-generation construct in December 2021. Development of the CLN7 program will continue in collaboration with existing partners with future clinical development to focus on the first-generation construct.
 CLN7 disease is a rare, fatal and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease that is a form of Batten disease. CLN7 is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the MFSD8 gene that results in lysosomal dysfunction. Disease onset occurs around two to five years of age, with death often ensuing in young adolescence. Patients experience gradual nerve cell loss in certain parts of the brain and typically present with seizures, vision loss, speech impairment and mental and motor regression. Currently, there are no approved therapies to treat CLN7 disease, which impacts an estimated 4,000 patients globally. Preclinical data in rodents supported advancement of the first-generation construct into a Phase 1 clinical proof-of-concept study in patients with CLN7 disease. In an in vivo efficacy study, IT administration of the first-generation construct to MFSD8 knockout mice with high or low doses resulted in clear age and dose effects with early intervention and high dose achieving the best therapeutic benefits. IT high dose of the first-generation construct in younger knockout mice resulted in: 1) widespread MFSD8 mRNA expression in all tissues assessed; 2) nearly complete normalization of impaired open field and rotarod performance at 6 and 9 months post injection; 3) more than doubled median life expectancy (16.82 months versus 7.77 months in untreated knockout mice); and 4) maintenance of healthy body weight for a prolonged period of time. Toxicology studies in wild type rodents demonstrated safety and tolerability of IT administration of the first-generation construct.
 Clinical safety data presented at WORLDSymposium in February 2022 for the first-generation construct from the ongoing clinical trial following IT administration further demonstrated that the first-generation construct was well-tolerated at multiple doses including 1.0x1015 total vg, which is the highest dose administered in humans ever for a gene therapy product. No adverse immune responses were noted, including no evidence of dorsal root ganglion toxicity or brain inflammation across all subjects. Moreover, stabilization in sural nerve conduction supported the absence of dorsal root ganglia inflammation. The ongoing trial includes three patients dosed to date, with two patients treated at the highest dose of 1.0x1015 total vg. Complete blood counts revealed no signs of bone marrow suppression or clinically significant bone marrow reactivity, and CSF analysis revealed no signs of pleocytosis. A fourth patient was recently dosed at 1.0x1015 total vg in March 2022. 
 TSHA-118 for CLN1 Disease
 CLN1 disease (one of the forms of Batten disease), a lysosomal storage disorder, is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease with early childhood onset that has an estimated incidence of approximately 1 in 138,000 live births worldwide. The estimated prevalence of CLN1 disease is 1,000 patients in the United States and European Union. CLN1 disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the CLN1 gene that encodes the enzyme palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1, or PPT1, a small glycoprotein involved in the degradation of certain lipid-modified proteins. Loss of function mutations in the CLN1 gene causes accumulation of these lipid-modified proteins in cells, eventually leading to aggregation, neuronal cellular dysfunction and ultimately neuronal cell death.
 In the infantile-onset form of CLN1 disease, clinical symptoms appear between six to 24 months and include rapid deterioration of speech and motor function, refractory epilepsy, ataxia and visual failure. Infantile-onset CLN1 patients are typically poorly responsive by five years of age and remain noncommunicative until their death, which usually occurs by seven years of age. Late-infantile-onset CLN1 disease begins between two to four years of age with initial visual and cognitive decline followed by the development of ataxia and myoclonus, or quick, involuntary muscle jerks. Juvenile-onset CLN1 disease patients present between the ages of five to ten years old, with vision loss as a first symptom followed by cognitive decline, seizures and motor decline. Approximately 60% of the children diagnosed with CLN1 disease in the United States present with early-onset infantile forms, with the remaining 40% experiencing later-onset childhood forms.
 15


All currently available therapeutic approaches for patients with CLN1 disease are targeted towards the treatment of symptoms, and no disease-modifying therapies have been approved. Gene therapy has shown promise in correcting forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, or NCL, diseases that involve mutations in soluble enzymes, in part, due to cross-correction of neighboring non-transduced cells.
 We believe that the introduction of a functional CLN1 gene using an AAV9 vector delivered intrathecally to the CNS offers the potential of a disease-modifying therapeutic approach for this disease. TSHA-118 is a self-complementary AAV9 viral vector that expresses human codon-optimized CLN1 complementary deoxyribonucleic acid under control of the chicken ß-actin hybrid promoter. We acquired exclusive worldwide rights to certain intellectual property rights and know-how relating to the research, development and manufacture of TSHA-118 (formerly ABO-202) in August 2020 pursuant to a license agreement with Abeona Therapeutics Inc., or Abeona.
 TSHA-118 has been granted orphan drug designation, rare pediatric disease designation and fast track designation from the FDA and orphan drug designation from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of CLN1 disease.
 There is currently an open IND for the CLN1 program. We submitted a CTA filing for TSHA-118 which was approved by Health Canada in 2021 and have initiated clinical development. 
 
TSHA-105 for SLC13A5 Deficiency
 We are developing TSHA-105 for the treatment of SLC13A5 deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive epileptic encephalopathy characterized by the onset of seizures within the first few days of life. SLC13A5 deficiency is caused by bi-allelic loss-of function mutations in the SLC13A5 gene, which codes for a sodium dependent citrate transporter, or NaCT, that is largely expressed in the brain and liver. To date, all tested mutations result in no or a greatly reduced amount of the citrate in the cells. Diminished NaCT function leads to loss of neuronal uptake of citrate and other metabolites such as succinate that are critical to brain energy metabolism and function. Affected children have impairments in gross motor function and speech production with relative preservation of fine motor skills and receptive speech. Currently, there are no approved therapies for SLC13A5 deficiency, and treatment is largely to address symptoms. The estimated prevalence of SLC13A5 deficiency is 1,900 patients in the United States and European Union.
 We are developing TSHA-105 as a gene replacement therapy for SLC13A5 deficiency. TSHA-105 is constructed from a codon-optimized human SLC13A5 gene packaged in a self-complementary AAV9 capsid. 
 We have received orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA and orphan drug designation from the European Commission for TSHA-105 for the treatment of epilepsy caused by caused by SLC13A5 deficiency. We expect to initiate clinical development on TSHA-105 in SLC13A5 deficiency in 2022.

TSHA-101 for GM2 Gangliosidosis
 GM2 gangliosidosis, which comprises Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease, refers to a group of lysosomal storage disorders caused by accumulation of the GM2 ganglioside in the lysosomes of cells within the CNS. Gangliosides are lipid components of cell membranes particularly abundant in the plasma membranes of neurons. Accumulation of GM2 ganglioside is caused by a deficiency in the Hex A enzyme, which is responsible for hydrolysis, or breakdown, of the GM2 ganglioside. This accumulation results in lysosomal rupture, leading to a poorly understood inflammatory cascade that results in neuronal cell death and neurodegeneration. The global incidence of GM2 gangliosidosis is approximately one per 150,000 live births. Approximately 80% to 85% of patients are diagnosed with an infantile form of GM2 gangliosidosis, with the remainder diagnosed with a juvenile or early-adulthood form of the disease. There are no approved therapies for the treatment of GM2 gangliosidosis, and care is generally palliative. Children diagnosed with GM2 gangliosidosis appear normal at birth but experience rapid neurodegeneration, culminating in death before the age of four, and patients with juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis rarely survive beyond their mid-teens as depicted below.  The estimated prevalence of GM2 gangliosidosis is 500 patients in the United States and European Union.

The Hex A enzyme is a heterodimer composed of two subunits: ß-hexosaminidase a (encoded in humans by the HEXA gene) and ß-hexosaminidase ß (encoded in humans by the HEXB gene). GM2 gangliosidosis caused by a mutation of the HEXA gene is termed Tay-Sachs disease, while Sandhoff disease is caused by a mutation of the HEXB gene. Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease result in clinically indistinguishable phenotypes for which there is no effective treatment. As illustrated in the graphic below, infantile GM2 gangliosidosis is the most common and severe form of the disease and is characterized by a lack of Hex A enzyme activity, while juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis is characterized by Hex A enzyme activity that is 0.5% to less than 2% of normal activity. Patients with adult-onset GM2 gangliosidosis have Hex A enzyme activity levels typically in the range of 2% to 4% of normal Hex A activity and may live a normal lifespan. We believe that the “critical threshold” for normal hydrolysis of GM2 ganglioside is estimated to be 5% to 10% of normal Hex A activity. Based on natural history data, patients with asymptomatic GM2 gangliosidosis have Hex A enzyme levels that are at least 5% of normal activity which would be considered disease modifying.
 


We believe that successful gene therapy to treat Tay-Sachs disease or Sandhoff disease requires expression of the α and ß subunits in a 1:1 ratio to ensure that Hex A expression confers a therapeutic benefit. An imbalanced expression of either subunit could result in the formation of a dysfunctional homodimer, or identical proteins, which would limit the efficacy of the therapy. Several therapeutic approaches utilize single vectors encoding either the α or ß subunit, while other approaches have utilized multiple vectors carrying the HEXA and HEXB genes separately. However, these approaches either fail to deliver the Hex A subunits in the appropriate ratio or require the simultaneous transduction of cells to achieve efficacy.
 Similar to other lysosomal enzymes, Hex A is ubiquitously expressed and therefore concerns related to off-target effects or overexpression are limited. In addition, Hex A is secreted from transduced cells and can be taken up by neighboring cells to correct their phenotype, making it possible to cure these diseases without the need to transduce every cell, a process referred to as cross-correction. Studies suggest that restoring Hex A enzyme levels to approximately 10% of normal may result in complete phenotypic absence of the disease.
 TSHA-101
 TSHA-101 is a neurodegenerative product candidate for the treatment of GM2 gangliosidosis. TSHA-101 is a bicistronic, or dual loci of transcription, HEXBP2A- HEXA transgene packaged into an AAV9 vector under the control of the CAG promoter. We have designed TSHA-101 to link the human HEXA and HEXB genes, utilizing a cleavable peptide linker, to ensure that the expression of each the subunit occurs simultaneously in the endogenous ratio. This approach is designed to maximize the expression of Hex A enzyme while minimizing the required therapeutic dosage.

We have received orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA and orphan drug designation from the European Commission for TSHA-101 for the treatment of GM2 gangliosidosis.
 

Results of Ongoing Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial
 TSHA-101 is currently being evaluated in an open label, Phase 1/2 adaptive trial for the treatment of infants with GM2 gangliosidosis sponsored by Queen’s University and led by Chief Scientific Advisor, Dr. Jagdeep Walia from the Division of Medical Genetics and Department of Pediatrics in Canada and Principal Investigator, Dr. Anupam Sehgal, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and pediatric intensivist at Queen’s University. The target recruitment for the trial is four subjects with GM2 gangliosidosis, including patients with either Sandhoff or Tay-Sachs disease who are 15 months of age or younger at the time of enrollment. Three patients have been dosed to date with a fourth patient currently in pre-screening; however, we have otherwise paused development of TSHA-101, and the conduct of this clinical trial, to improve operating efficiency. We will continue to follow the patients who were previously dosed.
 The primary endpoint for the trial is safety, including both clinical and laboratory assessments. The secondary endpoints evaluate efficacy, including pathologic, physiologic, functional and clinical markers. Patients are dosed intrathecally at a dose of 5 x 1014 total vg. An immunosuppression regimen of prednisolone and sirolimus is in place. There is an independent data safety monitoring board, or DSMB that provides oversight for safety matters and the conduct of the study.
 The key inclusion criteria include an age requirement of 15 months of age or younger at the time of dosing. All patients need to have disease confirmation by both biochemical confirmation of reduced Hex A enzyme activity as well as molecular confirmation of the infantile form of the disease.
 Current data include Hex A enzyme activity and safety for Patient 1 with Sandhoff disease at Month 1 and Month 3 and a Tay-Sachs patient at Month 1. Patient 3 has recently been dosed and has no available biomarker data at the time of data announcement in January 2022.
 19


Patient 1 achieved Hex A enzyme activity of 190% of normal at Month 1, and 288% of normal at Month 3 with 5% of Hex A enzyme activity correlating with asymptomatic patients with GM2 based on natural history. Hex A enzyme activity was 38-fold above this presumed asymptomatic level at Month 1 and 58-fold above the 5% asymptomatic level at Month 3. These data are shown below.
 

Below are the absolute levels of enzyme activity in serum at Month 1 and Month 3 for Patient 1 compared to the presumed asymptomatic level per natural history. The absolute value at Month 1 was 15.2 nmol/hr/ml and the absolute value at 3 months was 23.0 nmol/hr/ml.
 

20



Below is the serum Hex A enzyme activity data for Patient 2 with Tay-Sachs disease who was only eligible for the 1-month analysis at the time of evaluation. Patient 2 achieved Hex A enzyme activity of 25% of normal, representing 5-fold above the presumed asymptomatic level of 5% at Month 1.
 

Below are the absolute levels of enzyme activity in serum at Month 1 for Patient 2 compared to the presumed asymptomatic level per natural history. Patient 2’s Hex A enzyme activity of 2.0 nmol/hr/ml was 5-fold above the presumed asymptomatic level at Month 1.
 

Aside from β-Hexosaminidase A enzyme activity, we sought to identify additional ways to demonstrate recapitulation of a functional enzyme. In examining the overall enzymatic pathway below, under normal conditions, GM1 ganglioside is converted to GM2 ganglioside by GM1-β-galactosidase, and then subsequently, GM2 ganglioside is converted to GM3 ganglioside by β-Hexosaminidase A. GM2 gangliosidosis is a result of a lack of the β-Hexosaminidase A enzyme, resulting in a significantly elevated level of GM2 ganglioside substrate and a reduced level of GM3 ganglioside substrate. Restoration of a functional β-Hexosaminidase A enzyme should result in a 
 21


decrease in GM2 ganglioside substrate over time and an increase in GM3 ganglioside substrate with eventual equalization of both at a relatively low level.
 

In affected patients, GM3 levels remained consistent at a very low level over time due to blockage in the metabolic pathway. As shown below, substrate levels in Patient 1 with Sandhoff disease demonstrated a greater rate of increase in GM3 ganglioside versus GM2 ganglioside in the cerebral spinal fluid, or CSF, suggesting restoration of the metabolic pathway and Hex A enzyme function. Within 1 month, GM3 ganglioside increased 50% over baseline, suggesting conversion of GM2 to GM3 ganglioside and initial restoration of the functional enzymatic pathway. It is expected that GM3 levels in the CSF will continue to increase and GM2 levels will likely decrease, and over time will stabilize at physiological levels. 
 

Preliminary data suggest that TSHA-101 was well-tolerated with no significant drug-related events. Pre-treatment AST elevations were observed in both subjects, a finding that is common in GM2 gangliosidosis, with mild-to-moderate elevations that were asymptomatic, which were also noted after gene transfer.
 22


Patient 1 succumbed to a non-drug related adverse event, as determined by the principal investigator and the independent DSMB. Following treatment in September, Patient 1 demonstrated encouraging Hex A activity that was 190% of normal at Month 1 in October and 288% of normal at Month 3 in December. Following clinical examination, Patient 1 was displaying preliminary signs of clinical improvement and was deemed stable to return home in early December. Shortly after arriving home, Patient 1 was exposed to an upper respiratory tract infection from a family member, possibly COVID-19, and was hospitalized with a chest infection that rapidly progressed to pneumonia. While in the hospital, Patient 1 contracted hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA. Patient 1 succumbed to pneumonia and a pleural effusion with a secondary MRSA infection on Friday, January 14, 2022. The independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) concluded the death was unrelated to study drug.

 Government Regulation
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing.
 Biological products are subject to regulation under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.
 U.S. Biologics Regulation
 The process required by the FDA before biological product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with applicable regulations, including the good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biological product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 26


 
• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, or cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with the FDA’s good clinical practices, or GCPs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of a BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Development
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol or protocols for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product, chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the United States, certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are subject to oversight at the local level as set forth in the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, Guidelines. Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical study results to public registries.
 For purposes of BLA approval of a product candidate, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1. For gene therapies, the investigational product is initially introduced into patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 27


 
dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When these phases overlap or are combined, the trials may be referred to as Phase 1/2 or Phase 2/3.
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
 BLA Submission and Review
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. The FDA has sixty days from the applicant’s submission of a BLA to either issue a refusal to file letter or accept the BLA for filing, indicating that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review.
 Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent for its intended use, and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be manufactured, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification, which may include the potential requirement for additional clinical studies. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 28


If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
 A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers.
 A regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, is defined as cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. Gene therapies, including genetically modified cells that lead to a durable modification of cells or tissues may meet the definition of a Regenerative Medicine Therapy. The RMAT program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of RMATs, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A new drug application or a BLA for an RMAT may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through (1) surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit or (2) reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of such designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A Regenerative Medicine Therapy that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
 Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date.
 Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 29


Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or 200,000 or more than individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee.
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Priority Review Vouchers
 Under the FDCA, as amended, the FDA incentivizes the development of drugs and biologics that meet the definition of a “rare pediatric disease,” defined to mean a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious of life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years and the disease affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or affects 200,000 or more in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be received from sales in the United States of such drug. The sponsor of a product candidate for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible for a voucher that can be used to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug or biologic application after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug product, referred to as a priority review voucher, or PRV. A sponsor may request rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA prior to the submission of its NDA or BLA. A rare pediatric disease designation does not guarantee that a sponsor will receive a PRV upon approval of its NDA or BLA. Moreover, a sponsor who chooses not to submit a rare pediatric disease designation request may nonetheless receive a PRV upon approval of their marketing application if they request such a voucher in their original marketing application and meet all of the eligibility criteria. If a PRV is received, it may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Congress has extended the PRV program until September 30, 2024, with the potential for PRVs to be granted until September 30, 2026.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 30


The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 31


The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
 Foreign Regulation
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the civil False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and similar foreign, federal and state fraud and abuse, transparency and privacy laws.
 The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including stock options. The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and others on the other hand. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but they are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration, such as consulting agreements, that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
 Civil and criminal false claims laws, and civil monetary penalty laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent. For example, the civil False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product.
 HIPAA created additional federal civil and criminal liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose certain requirements on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearing houses and health plans, and individuals and entities that provide services on their behalf that involve individually identifiable health information, known as business associates, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, as well as their covered subcontractors. HITECH also created new tiers of civil 
 32


monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other health care professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 We are also subject to additional similar U.S. state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor, state laws which require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state and local laws which require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws which require the reporting of information related to drug pricing, state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, imprisonment damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any product, if approved, depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement, if any, for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our product candidates, if approved, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover any product candidates we may develop could reduce physician utilization of such product candidates once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
 For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization.
 In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for any biological candidates we may develop will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct 
 33


a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of any product candidates we may develop to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.
 Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded healthcare programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
 The ACA, which was enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, which started on January 1, 2019, for not complying with ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, and increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is also unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional action is taken by Congress. However, pursuant to COVID-19 pandemic relief legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Congress is considering additional health reform measures.
 34


Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed to January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on August 10, 2021, CMS published a proposed rule that seeks to rescind the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles.  It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. 
 Additional state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
