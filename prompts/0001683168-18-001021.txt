About Mobiquity Networks
 
Mobiquity Networks is a next generation location data intelligence company. Mobiquity Networks provides precise unique, at-scale location-based data and insights on consumer’s real-world behavior and trends for use in marketing and research. We provide accurate and precise location data on approximately fifty (50,000,000) million mobile devices to help marketers and researchers better understand consumer’s real-world behavior and trends. Our data is first party supplied directly from our app partners through our SDK or direct server-to-serve feeds. First party data is considered the most valuable data that can be collected. Data provided by Mobiquity Networks is deterministic with a high degree of accuracy and precision.
 
Uniqueness of Mobiquity Networks’ data:
 

· | Massive Scale: 50 million plus unique devices; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Proprietary Places Database; 
· | Data Density: average 100 plus data points collected per user/day; 
· | Spatial Precision: 80% accurate within 20 meters; 
· | Verified Visits: frequency and dwell time to determine real consumer visits;
· | Diverse Data: many app partners utilizing precise location; and 
· | Privacy Compliant. 

Strategy
 
Mobiquity Networks derives its revenue utilizing the revenue streams mentioned above. All the products used to derive revenue for the Company are reliant on the collection of data. To achieve management’s revenue goals moving forward, we have developed a strategy to increase the two main driving forces behind our data collection. One strategy is to increase the total number of users we see on a monthly basis (“MAU”), and the second strategy is to increase the total number of locations (Places) available to see our MAU’s over the same time period. We are currently seeing approximately 50,000,000 unique mobile devices on a monthly basis. The ability to see and collect the data required from these unique devices comes from the installation of our proprietary Software Development Kit (SDK) into various mobile applications (Apps) or through a direct server-to-server data feed from our App partners. To continue to grow the total number of unique devices we can see on a monthly basis, we need to increase our App partnerships. We believe our unique offering to potential App partners gives us a competitive advantage over others in the industry. The task of partnering with Apps is handled internally by our business development team.
 
As of April 2018, we had over 2,000,000 Places in our proprietary Places database, and we anticipate growth to over 4,000,000 Places by the fourth quarter of 2018, thus exponentially increasing the amount of data we collect. We have been able to steadily increase the number of locations available in our Places database through the use of both open source and proprietary technologies. The task of growing our Places database is handled by our internal technology team. The Company currently utilizes both internal and outsourced resources to market and sell its product offerings. Management intends to hire additional sales personnel in the last three quarters of 2018 as working capital permits.

Agreements with Developers
 
Due to the evolution of the Mobiquity Network’s business model, our agreements with Mall developers are no longer considered essential to our business operations as our Places data base has grown to include these locations making malls a subset within our retail category. This is the major reason why we have allowed our mall developer contracts to expire or be terminated.
Our Proprietary Technology Platform
 
Mobiquity Networks has developed a highly accurate and scalable proprietary cloud-based location platform to allow millions of connected devices to easily and securely log billions of events per day and receive user notifications in real or near real-time.
 
Mobiquity Networks’ platform analyzes a combination of raw GPS, Wi-Fi and iBeacon radio signals when collecting mobile data to identify user patterns in densely populated urban areas, indoor specific locations or desired points of interest. This data is additionally analyzed and enriched with how often users visit specific locations, and how much time they spend at each location. The resulting combined contextual data ensures clients receive highly accurate insights into consumers’ offline behavior.
 
Mobiquity Networks’ platform is hosted and managed on Amazon Web Service (AWS) and takes full advantage of open standards for processing, storage, security and big data technology. Specifically, the Mobiquity Networks platform uses the following AWS services: EC2, Lambda, Kafka, Kinesis, S3, Storm, Spark, Machine Learning, RDS, Redshift, Elastic Map Reduction, CloudWatch, and Elastic Search Service with built-in Kibana integration.
 
Mobiquity Networks’ unique approach to validating mobile device location produces extremely precise and accurate location data. Additionally, Mobiquity Networks has begun adding blockchain technology to its platform to increase security, transparency and accountability.
 
The Mobiquity Networks’ SDK for iOS and Android is a proprietary intelligent replacement for iOS CLLocation Manager and the Android Location Manager technology. It provides all the existing location manager functionality plus adds the following benefits:
 

· | advanced location technology capabilities (such as always-on location services, enhanced accuracy, lower battery drain, and others);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | automatic venue recognition;
--+-----------------------------


· | access to physical address and venue map database; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | a detailed location analytics.
--+-------------------------------

 
Mobiquity Networks’ SDK enables partner publishers to add enhanced location capabilities, and therefore personalized experiences, to their mobile applications without the need for location expertise.
 
Mobiquity Networks has assembled a comprehensive location database to convert geographical coordinates to a physical address in the real world. This database includes the street level venue storefronts and entrance for businesses in the U.S., addresses, building polygons, venue polygons, and other related points of interest information. Currently this database has over 2 million locations and continues to be populated thereby improving the platforms’ algorithm for user accuracy.
 
Utilizing massively parallel cluster computing and machine learning algorithms and technology, Mobiquity Networks processes user dwell-time and frequency of visitation data within iBeacons, Wi-Fi and GPS signals to segment highly targetable audiences for marketing and research. This data processing provides valuable, actionable geo-behavioral data for marketers, researchers and application publishers and made available through an automated platform.
 
The Mobiquity Networks platform automatically synchronizes audience data to various Data Management Providers (DMP), Demand Side Providers (DSP), trading desks and other partners using its marketplace connection application programmer interfaces (API).
 
Clients and Publishing partners are given access to a comprehensive dashboard to view mobile device traffic and audience information. This information can be both viewed and access via API to incorporate into internal client systems.

Intellectual Property 
 
In March 2013, we formed Mobiquity Networks and Mobiquity Wireless in Spain. Mobiquity Wireless then acquired the assets of our then licensor, FuturLink. These assets include, without limitation, the FuturLink technology which consists of patent applications, source codes and trademark(s). The patent applications acquired related to the hardware and associated process for identifying and acquiring connections to mobile devices and the process for delivering select content to users on an opt-in basis. We believe our acquisition of FuturLink’s technology and corresponding patent applications provided us with the flexibility and autonomy to improve, upgrade and integrate new ideas and cutting-edge technologies into our existing platform. This has allowed us to evolve as new technologies emerge. To date, we have been granted two patents and published and additional four patents. We believe that our intellectual property is a valuable asset to us as we move forward with our technology platform.
Governmental Regulations
 
Federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we collect. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, self-regulatory requirements and legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, including those relating to the use of data for marketing purposes. As we develop and provide solutions that address new market segments, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs or restrict our operations. From time to time, we may be notified of or otherwise become aware of additional laws and regulations that governmental organizations or others may claim should be applicable to our business. Our failure to anticipate the application of these laws and regulations accurately, or other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity or cause us to alter our business practices, which could cause our net revenues to decrease, our costs to increase or our business otherwise to be harmed. See “Risk Factors.”
 
We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce and m-commerce in a number of jurisdictions around the world.

These regulations and laws may involve taxation, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, data protection, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts, electronic communications and consumer protection. It is not clear how existing laws and regulations governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet as the vast majority of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet, e-commerce or m-commerce. It is possible that general business regulations and laws, or those specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce or m-commerce may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. See “Risk Factors.”
 
Integrated Marketing Company
 
Our former subsidiary, Ace Marketing & Promotions, Inc. (or Ace Marketing), which was sold on October 1, 2017 had historically represented substantially all of the operating revenues. Ace Marketing was an integrated marketing company focused on working with clients to grow their business. Ace Marketing’s core business was to provide a wide range of quality promotional products to a wide range of corporate, non-profit and educational clients. In addition, Ace Marketing offered brand analysis and development, website analysis and development, database analysis and building, and integrated marketing campaigns using: direct mail, email marketing, mobile marketing, promotional products and other mediums that helped our clients connect with their customers and acquire new business.
Competition
 
We compete in the location data, marketing and research business and in all other facets of our business against small, medium and large companies throughout the United States. Some examples include companies such as Placed, Factual and Foursquare. Although we can give no assurance that our business will be able to compete against other companies with greater experience and resources, we believe we have a competitive advantage with our proprietary Places Database, software and technology platform.
