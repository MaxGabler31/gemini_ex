ITEM 1             BUSINESS 
Overview 
 
XBiotech Inc. (“XBiotech” or the “Company) is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers and develops True Human™ monoclonal antibodies for treating a variety of diseases. XBiotech was incorporated in Canada on March 22, 2005.
 
True Human™ monoclonal antibodies are derived from natural human immune responses—as opposed to being derived from animal immunization or otherwise engineered. XBiotech’s belief is that naturally occurring monoclonal antibodies have the potential to be safer, more effective and faster to develop than engineered counterparts. XBiotech has developed a pipeline of product candidates targeting both inflammatory and infectious diseases. The Company has also developed manufacturing technology that reduces the cost and time to launch new product candidates. Moreover, a state-of-the-art physical plant and infrastructure to manufacture product has been constructed and is operational at the Company’s 48 acre campus in Austin, Texas. XBiotech also has an in-house clinical operations group, with the capability to launch and manage clinical development of its candidate products. The Company thus represents a fully integrated developer of biopharmaceuticals.
 
An area of medical focus for XBiotech are therapies that block a potent substance naturally produced by body, known as interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1a), that mediates tissue breakdown, angiogenesis, the formation of blood clots, malaise, muscle wasting and inflammation.  IL-1a is a protein that is on or in cells of the body and is involved in the body’s response to injury or trauma. In almost all chronic and in some acute injury scenarios (such as stroke or heart attack), IL-1a may mediate harmful disease-related activity.
 
XBiotech sold bermekimab, a True Human™ antibody that blocks IL-1a activity, for $1.35 billion in cash and potential milestone payments (the “Janssen Transaction”). As part of the Janssen Transaction, XBiotech agreed not to further develop any anti-IL-1a antibodies in dermatology. The Company is pursuing the development of other True Human™ antibodies targeting IL-1a for areas of medicine outside of dermatology. The Company has already identified new IL-1a targeting product candidates that it is has brought into clinical studies. While the Company previously was focused on a single True Human™ antibody targeting IL-1a, it is currently developing two product candidates, and may develop one or more others, that target IL-1a and are used in specific areas of medicine.
 
Financial
 
XBiotech received $675 million on December 30, 2019 and $75 million on June 30, 2021 from the sale of bermekimab. In February 2020, XBiotech used approximately $420 million to repurchase stock from its shareholders. In July 2021, XBiotech distributed $75 million cash dividend to its shareholders.  The remaining cash was reserved for ongoing operations as part of its multi-year business plan to identify and develop True Human™ antibodies, including anti-Il-1a therapies, aiming for new potential transactions for these drug candidates.
 
Since January 1, 2020 XBiotech also used its proprietary manufacturing technology, its manufacturing plant and infrastructure to produce drug product for under a supply agreement with Janssen. In addition, during 2020 and 2021 XBiotech provided clinical trial operations services for two Phase II clinical studies. In 2022 XBiotech executed a new manufacturing supply agreement with a Janssen related company to extend its production of bermekimab. Revenue from contract manufacturing and clinical services has and continues to offset a significant portion of operating expenses. We believe that XBiotech is in a very favorable position for an R&D stage biopharmaceutical, with a strong cash position in its balance sheet related to sale of its drug candidate, the absence of debt, a robust pipeline and ongoing contract income.

Further Development of IL-1a Therapies
 
IL-1a plays a key role in disease. While it is produced naturally by the body, when not properly controlled, in situations of acute or chronic injury, IL-1a can contribute to the development and progression of a variety of medical conditions, such as cancer, stroke, heart attack or arthritis, to name a few. Completed clinical studies and a myriad of scientific research have shown that blocking IL-1a may have a beneficial effect in some or most of these medical conditions. The potential unmet medical need for blocking IL-1a is therefore very significant. In 2021, the Company entered the clinic with a molecule targeting IL-1⍺ in Oncology (Pancreatic Cancer). The company has also filed an INDs and started a clinical program in Rheumatology; and has filed IND for a different anti-IL-1⍺ antibody in cardiovascular medicine.
 
Because the potential medical uses for anti-IL-1a therapy is so large, the Company is developing more than one True Human™ antibody, each neutralizing IL-1a, but designating different antibodies for use in specific areas of medicine. This will potentially allow XBiotech to individually partner different antibodies according to unique medical areas. The Company expects this will diversify risk for anti-IL-1a therapies, allow multiple partnerships, maximize value and facilitate greater resource dedication to these True Human™ therapeutics.
 
Infectious Disease Pipeline
 
XBiotech continued to achieve significant milestones with its infectious disease pipeline in 2021. The Company has identified several major areas of urgent unmet medical need for True Human™ anti-infective antibody therapies. True Human™ antibodies may be used therapeutically or prophylactically to supplement immunity in aging individuals where a natural decline in the robustness of the immune system leaves gaps and vulnerability to infectious diseases. True Human™ antibodies derived from healthy individuals with strong natural immunity to specific diseases are the source of our product candidates, which we believe can be used to supplement the weakening immune system that occurs with age. The Company believes this can be a highly effective means for providing protection against viral diseases such as shingles or intestinal bacterial infections such as C. difficile.
 
True Human™ antibodies may also be used to provide highly potent and targeted immunity against infectious diseases in young otherwise healthy individuals where infectious agents have overwhelmed natural immunity. For example, this can occur during intravenous drug use, from a deep puncture wound, or from the result of surgery, where bacteria has gained unnatural entry into a body compartment where it can establish and evade the immune system. Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin resistant (MRSA) variant, is an example of our candidate anti-infective therapeutics.
 
Another patient population where True Human™ antibodies may be particularly useful is in infants. Primary to developing strong immunity, infants can be vulnerable to infections. Particularly premature infants may need supplemental immunity against specific infectious agents, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In 2021, the Company continued making progress in its search for a True Human antibody therapeutic candidate for RSV.
 
In 2021, the Company also started antibody discovery projects to isolate neutralizing antibodies against Norovirus and Measles virus. Norovirus continues to cause outbreaks in the US over the years. According to the CDC report, during August 1, 2021 – January 8, 2022, there were 156 norovirus outbreaks reported by NoroSTAT-participating states. During the same period in 2020, there were 16 norovirus outbreaks reported by these states. A Norovirus therapeutic antibody is expected to decrease morbidity and mortality in high-risk populations. Similarly, measles outbreaks have occurred sporadically in the US due to the following reasons: an increase in the number of travelers who get measles abroad and bring it into the U.S., and further spread of measles in U.S. communities with pockets of unvaccinated people. Therefore a therapeutic candidate against measles continues to be an unmet need and is a part of the XBiotech R&D pipeline.
 
    7 

  

We believe True Human™ antibody therapies have a very important application in the case of potent viruses, like for example, influenza, where the aggressive nature of the virus takes even relatively strong immune systems to the limits. Here again, in elderly, the young or those with weakened immune systems, an aggressive virus like influenza can be life threatening. In 2020, XBiotech announced that it had developed an antibody cocktail that is capable of neutralizing all known forms of influenza— from the deadly 1918 strain to the most recent versions of flu.
 
In 2019, XBiotech completed the construction of a new infectious disease and animal facility laboratory. Located in a separate building on our campus, just a short walk from the Company’s main manufacturing headquarters, the new facility incorporates an animal biological safety level 2 (ABSL2) laboratory and other laboratories for in vitro and in vivo testing of the Company’s True Human™ antibodies against infectious disease targets.
 
The ABSL2 laboratory is currently being used to test XBiotech’s True Human™ antibodies derived from healthy persons with natural immunity to the varicella virus. Natural human immunity is very effective at neutralizing varicella for most of our lives, when we might have billions of different antibodies. Later in life, as we age, the quantity and diversity of our antibody repertoires diminishes. We produce less antibodies against fewer targets. Even though we may have had decades of antibodies protecting us against varicella, as we age a “hole” can develop in the antibody repertoire that was responsible for controlling varicella. When this happens, varicella virus that has been “hiding” in cells of our body can resurge, spread about the body and cause debilitating disease. XBiotech has isolated potent True Human™ antibodies from healthy donors with potent neutralizing antibodies against varicella. We believe that patients suffering from resurgent varicella due to aging immune systems may be effectively treated by supplementing with True Human™ antibody therapy against varicella. There is a substantial unmet medical need for shingles therapy; and other indications where uncontrolled varicella infections, such in infants whose immune systems are not yet adequately developed.
 
Infrastructure
 
During 2021 XBiotech undertook to expand its main integrated manufacturing and R&D center. The expansion of the main R&D center was ongoing throughout 2021 and is now complete. The expansion has resulted the creation of two new wings, one that provides laboratory research infrastructure for scientists and another general work areas for manufacturing, clinical personnel and others. The building additions have enhanced the Company’s ability to house a larger workforce, expand R&D activities and orchestrate the production of multiple drug products from its existing manufacturing and R&D center. XBiotech owns its 48-acre campus—and all structures on the property—debt-free.

Sale of Drug Candidate and Equity Transaction
 
The sale of the anti-IL-1a antibody provided sufficient capital to allow the Company to complete a modified Dutch auction tender offer in February 2020, in which the Company repurchased $420 million of its stock from shareholders. The tender offer provided liquidity to the Company’s shareholders while allowing the Company to consolidate its equity ownership and retain sufficient capital to continue pursuing its business objectives. Final results of the tender offer, announced on February 19, 2020, reported that the Company purchased 14,000,000 common shares at a price of $30.00 per share for an aggregate price of approximately $420 million (excluding fees and expenses related to the offer). The shares repurchased represented approximately 32.67% of the common shares outstanding.  The final proration factor for shares that XBiotech purchased pursuant to the tender offer was ultimately deemed to be approximately 33.25%. No equity offerings were made during 2020. In July 2021, XBiotech distributed a cash dividend, in the aggregate amount of $75 million or approximately $2.50 per share, to its shareholders.
A Background on Therapeutic Antibodies 
 
A century ago, scientists and physicians envisioned being able to custom design therapeutic "antibodies” that were highly specific for a single target. By selectively attacking disease while sparing healthy tissue, these “magic bullets” were anticipated to be ideal therapeutic agents. It was not until the early 1970’s, however, that this vision was realized when Kohler and Milstein developed a ground-breaking method for making target-specific monoclonal antibodies—a Nobel prize-winning endeavor. Using this new approach, numerous monoclonal antibody-based research, diagnostic, and therapeutic products developed.
 
Kohler and Milstein’s discovery was based on their knowledge that the immune system of higher animals produces antibodies as a method of protecting them from various harmful agents, such as viruses, bacteria, and diseased cells. White blood cells, known as B cells, produce billions of different types of antibodies, each with a unique potential to bind and neutralize different disease targets. The vast array of possible treatments based on antibodies led to the development of what is now a major industry around the use of therapeutic antibodies.
 
True Human™ Antibodies 
 
White blood cells in the human body secrete billions of different antibodies that circulate through the blood to react and protect us from toxins, infectious agents or even other unwanted substances produced by our body. True Human™ antibodies, as the name implies, are simply those that are derived from a natural antibody identified from the blood of an individual. To develop a True Human™ antibody therapy, donors are screened to find an individual that has a specific antibody that matches the desired characteristics needed to obtain the intended medical benefit. White blood cells from that individual are obtained, the unique gene that produced the antibody is cloned, and the genetic information is used to produce an exact replica of the antibody sequence. A True Human™ antibody is, therefore, not to be confused with other marketed antibodies, such as so-called “fully human” antibodies—where antibody reactivity is developed through gene sequence engineering in the laboratory.

Fundamental Science of True Human™ Antibodies 

To appreciate the background safety and tolerability of True Human™ antibodies, it is important to consider the fundamental biology of natural antibody production.
 
Billions of different white blood cells secrete billions of unique antibodies every day into circulation. The vast number of different antibodies (and cells that produce them), are essential to enable adequate molecular diversity to ward off a vast range of potential infectious or toxic threats. In other words, since antibodies act to bind and thereby neutralize unwanted agents, any given circulating antibody must be able to react with a potentially limitless number of existing or evolving disease entities.
 
The staggering number of different antibodies needed to achieve this level of preparedness, however, is a daunting concept from a genetics point of view. If an individual antibody gene was needed to encode each of a billion different antibodies, there would be approximately 20,000 times as many genes needed just for antibodies as there would be needed to encode the rest of the entire human genome. Individual cells would need to be gigantic, and monumental resources of the body would be required to make, copy and maintain all of the DNA. Clearly, the system of antibodies could not have evolved to protect us, had not an elegant solution emerged to deal with this genetic conundrum.
 
Thus, a hallmark of the immune physiology of all vertebrates (all have antibodies) is the ability to recombine and selectively mutate a relatively small number of gene segments to create a phenomenal and effectively unlimited number of antibody genes. By rearranging, recombining and mutating the genetic code, specialized white blood cells, or B lymphocytes, are able to create an unlimited array of antibody genes. The consequence of this genetic engineering, however, is that each antibody gene is unique to the individual B lymphocyte that created it—and no copy of the gene exists in the human germline. The only place to find a unique antibody gene is in the individual cells that created it.
 
The extraordinary process of gene rearrangement and mutation results in a multitude of unique B lymphocytes and consequently an incredibly diverse repertoire of antibodies in any given individual.
 
Elucidating the mechanisms behind the production of unique antibody genes must be considered one of the major achievements of medical research in the 20th century. Yet unfolding this mystery created another problem to solve: If antibodies were not produced from genes encoded in the human genome and the products of these genes were new to the body, why were these antibody molecules not recognized by the immune system as foreign substances—like any other foreign substance that they were intended to eradicate? How could the body distinguish the apparently “foreign” antibody molecules from the bona fide infectious intruders?
 
Unraveling the genetics of antibody production led to another major advance in medicine: the discovery of how an endless array of antibody proteins could be made in a way that individual molecules were always tolerated by the body.
 
In the early 1990s, research began to demonstrate that the production of antibodies was not an unregulated process. Rather, it was learned that the antibodies produced by each and every B lymphocyte were subject to intense scrutiny. Studies showed that B lymphocytes which produced acceptable antibodies were stimulated to grow while those that produced “autoreactive” antibodies were not. B lymphocytes that produced “good” antibodies were stimulated to proliferate and enabled to produce copious amounts of antibody in the event it was needed to ward off a harmful agent. B lymphocytes that rearranged genes to produce antibodies that were ineffective or were autoreactive were given signals that instructed them to engage in a process of programmed cell death. Thus, B lymphocytes producing harmful or useless antibodies are simply killed off. This mechanism for creating antibody diversity on the one hand, while protecting the individual from a mass of unwanted or intolerable antibody molecules on the other, was as elegant as it was fundamental to the success of vertebrate immune physiology.
 
This process of “selection” has been elucidated in great detail. There can be no more important feature of immune physiology than the process of selection. Selection is a fundamental step to enable the body to produce an extremely diverse set of antibody molecules without, in the process, producing an array of novel molecules that cause harm.

Industry Context 
 
Until now each and every therapeutic antibody on the market has been derived from animals and/or through gene sequence modification in the laboratory to produce a desired antibody reactivity. Marketed antibodies to date, described as “fully human”, are not derived from human gene sequences that have undergone the crucial process of selection in a human.
 
Without exception, all marketed products to date that are described as “fully human”, are in fact engineered and are not selected based on natural tolerance in the human body. The use of the term “fully human” to describe these products has thus created considerable confusion. To our knowledge, there are at present no True Human™ antibodies manufactured, using recombinant protein technology, currently marketed.
 
Platform Technology 
 
Our True Human™ antibody therapeutics are developed in-house using our proprietary discovery platform. There are significant technical challenges in identifying and cloning genes for True Human™ antibodies. A key problem to overcome can be to first identify individuals with the desired antibody reactivity. This can involve screening thousands of blood donors to enable the identification of a single, clinically relevant antibody—discovered from literally trillions of irrelevant background antibody molecules in the blood of donors. To distinguish the clinically relevant antibodies from irrelevant background antibody molecules in donor bloods, we use our Super High Stringency Antibody Mining (SHSAM™) technology.  White blood cells from that individual can then be isolated, and the unique gene that produced the native antibody obtained. We currently obtain blood donor samples through a Research and Collaboration Agreement with the South Texas Blood & Tissue Center, a Texas 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. 
 
Novel cloning technologies developed at XBiotech have enabled us to clone the crucial antibody gene sequences from these donors in order to reproduce a True Human™ antibody for use in clinical therapy. A True Human™ monoclonal antibody should therefore not be confused with other marketed therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, such as those currently referred to as “fully human” antibodies.
 
Market Opportunity 
 
We have a number of indications in various stages of clinical or pre-clinical development with significant market opportunities. These include an array of inflammatory conditions as well as infectious disease indications. The potential market opportunities in these various indications are vast and we believe our research and manufacturing technologies, designed to more rapidly, cost-effectively and flexibly produce new therapies, will be advantageous in each market space.
Our Strategy 
 
Our objective is to fundamentally change the way drugs are developed and commercialized and become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapeutic True Human™ antibodies. The key goals of our business strategy are to:
 
    11 

  


• | Advance our pipeline of therapeutic antibodies and initiate clinical programs in strategic therapeutic areas;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Discover other True Human™ antibody therapies using our proprietary platform; and

• | Leverage our manufacturing technology.
--+---------------------------------------

Product Pipeline 
 
Our product development status for the end of the year 2021 was as follows: 
 


Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 97 employees, all full-time employees.
 
Competition 
 
The therapeutic antibody space is dynamic as there continues to be a highly active commercial pipeline of therapeutic antibodies globally, involving a complex array of development cycles as products reach the end of their patent life and as new candidate products proceed into pivotal studies and approach registration. There are numerous independent reviews on the subject in both trade journals and academic press (one such example being Reichert JM, Antibodies to watch in 2018 MAbs. 2018 Jan 4:1-21).
 
We believe True Human™ therapeutic antibodies have important differentiating factors from other monoclonal antibodies currently marketed. However, regardless of the potential advantages or uniqueness of our current or future product candidates in the market, we do expect these products to compete head-to-head with the numerous existing candidate antibody products in development, including emerging biosimilar therapeutic antibodies.
 
Safety 
 
The Company’s True Human™ antibodies are derived from a natural human immune response. It is expected that this will facilitate better tolerability when used as a therapeutic compared to humanized or “fully human” monoclonal antibodies. Antibody therapies are known to be associated with significant risk for infusion reactions, including serious anaphylactic reactions. It is the Company’s belief that these reactions are, in large part, the result of using antibodies that were not derived from natural human immunity but rather had engineered specificities.

Intellectual Property 
 
XBiotech has developed a large international intellectual property (IP) portfolio to protect important aspects of its technology, services, and products, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets.
 
Sale of a Portion of XBiotech’s IL-1a Patent Portfolio and Retention of Certain Rights Thereto.
 
On December 7, 2019, XBiotech entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) under which it received $750 million upfront payment and the potential to receive another $600 million in milestone payments. Under the Purchase Agreement, XBiotech assigned a substantial portion of its patent portfolio covering the drug product candidate, bermekimab, that blocks the action of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1a).  Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, on December 30, 2019, XBiotech assigned to the purchaser 12 patent families related to bermekimab and the use of IL-1α-specific antibodies for treating various conditions, including arthritis, neoplastic diseases, dermatological pathologies, vascular diseases, inflammatory skin disease and psychiatric conditions, cachexia, diabetes, atopic dermatitis and hidradenitis suppurativa.
 
An IP non-assertion and license agreement (the “IP Agreement”) incorporated into the Purchase Agreement allows XBiotech to develop and commercialize new antibody products which block IL-1a for all areas of medicine outside of dermatology without infringing the patent rights assigned under the Purchase Agreement. The IP Agreement further provides XBiotech the opportunity to enforce certain patent rights within the assigned portfolio that relate to the use of anti-IL-1a antibodies to treat non-dermatological disease against third parties in the event the purchaser elects not to do so.
