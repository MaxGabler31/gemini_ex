ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Our Company

Assertio Therapeutics, Inc. (Assertio or the Company) is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on neurology, orphan and specialty medicines. Our current specialty pharmaceutical business includes the following three products which we market in the United States (U.S.):

• | Gralise® (gabapentin), a once daily product for the management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), that we launched in October 2011.


• | CAMBIA® (diclofenac potassium for oral solution), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the acute treatment of migraine attacks, that we acquired in December 2013.


• | Zipsor® (diclofenac potassium liquid filled capsules), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of mild to moderate acute pain, that we acquired in June 2012.

We also have the exclusive rights to market long-acting cosyntropin (synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone, or ACTH) in the U.S. and Canada. Long-acting cosyntropin is an alcohol-free formulation of a synthetic analogue of ACTH. In February 2019, notification of acceptance for filing was received from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for our 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) for our novel injectable formulation of long-acting cosyntropin. We, together with our development partner, seek approval for the use of this product as a diagnostic drug in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency. 
We maintain a Commercialization Agreement with Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Collegium) pursuant to which we granted Collegium the right to commercialize the NUCYNTA® franchise of pain products in the United States. Pursuant to the Commercialization Agreement, Collegium assumed all commercialization responsibilities for the NUCYNTA franchise effective January 9, 2018, including sales and marketing. We receive a royalty on all NUCYNTA revenues based on certain net sales thresholds.
Corporate Information
The address of our Internet website is http://www.assertiotx.com. We make available, free of charge through our website or upon written request, our Annual Reports on Form 10‑K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10‑Q, Current Reports on Form 8‑K and other periodic SEC reports, along with amendments to all of those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file the reports with the SEC.
Assertio was formerly known as Depomed, Inc. and was originally incorporated in California in August 1995. On August 14, 2018 (Effective Time), we reincorporated from California to Delaware and changed our name to Assertio Therapeutics, Inc.

Products
Gralise (Gabapentin)

Gralise is our proprietary, once‑daily formulation of gabapentin indicated for management of PHN, a persistent pain condition caused by nerve damage during a shingles, or herpes zoster, viral infection. We made Gralise commercially available in October 2011, following its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in January 2011. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug exclusivity for PHN.
CAMBIA (Diclofenac Potassium for Oral Solution)

CAMBIA is a non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drug (NSAID) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults 18 years of age or older. We acquired CAMBIA in December 2013 from Nautilus Neurosciences, Inc. (Nautilus). We began shipping and recognizing product sales on CAMBIA in December 2013.
Zipsor (Diclofenac Potassium Liquid‑Filled Capsules)

Zipsor is an NSAID indicated for relief of mild to moderate acute pain in adults. Zipsor uses proprietary ProSorb® delivery technology to deliver a finely dispersed, rapidly absorbed formulation of diclofenac. We acquired Zipsor in June 2012 from Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Xanodyne). We began shipping and recognizing product sales on Zipsor in June 2012.

NUCYNTA ER (Tapentadol Extended Release Tablets) and NUCYNTA IR (NUCYNTA) (Tapentadol)

NUCYNTA ER is an extended release version of tapentadol that is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around‑the‑clock, long term opioid treatment, including neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in adults, and for which alternate treatment options are inadequate. NUCYNTA is an immediate release version of tapentadol that is indicated for the management of moderate to severe acute pain in adults. We acquired the U.S. rights to NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen Pharma) and began shipping and recognizing product sales on NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA in April 2015. We began commercial promotion of NUCYNTA ER and NUCYNTA in June 2015.

In December 2017, we entered into a Commercialization Agreement with Collegium, which we amended in November 2018. Pursuant to the Commercialization Agreement, we granted Collegium the right to commercialize the NUCYNTA franchise of pain products in the United States. Collegium assumed all commercialization responsibilities for the NUCYNTA franchise effective January 9, 2018, including sales and marketing. We receive a royalty on all NUCYNTA revenues based on certain net sales thresholds, with a minimum royalty of $132.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Beginning in 2019, we will receive royalties based on certain annual NUCYNTA net sales thresholds for future years. Both we and Collegium may terminate the Commercialization Agreement under certain circumstances; however, Collegium may not terminate the agreement prior to the end of 2021. Additionally, we retained certain rights to co-promote NUCYNTA products, subject to providing advanced notice to Collegium. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4.

In February 2019, notification of acceptance for filing was received from the FDA for our 505(b)(2) NDA for our novel injectable formulation of long-acting cosyntropin. We, together with our partner, West, seek approval for the use of this product as a diagnostic drug in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency.
Collaboration and License Agreement with Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ironwood) 
In July 2011, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ironwood granting Ironwood a license for worldwide rights to certain patents and other intellectual property rights to our Acuform drug delivery technology for IW 3718, an Ironwood product candidate under evaluation for refractory GERD. During the second quarter of 2018, we received a $5.0 million milestone payment related to the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 trial. We will receive additional contingent milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain development milestones and royalties on net sales of the product, if approved.
PDL BioPharma, Inc. (PDL) Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement
In October 2013, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Royalty Purchase and Sale Agreement with PDL (Royalty Purchase Agreement), we sold to PDL our right to receive royalty, milestone and other specified payments arising on and after October 2013 under each of the following license agreements relating to our Acuform technology in the Type 2 diabetes therapeutic area: (i) the License and Services Agreement, effective as of March 4, 2011, with Boehringer Ingelheim International GMBH (BI) relating to potential future development milestones and sales of BI’s investigational fixed-dose combinations of drugs and extended-release metformin worldwide; (ii) the License Agreement, effective as of August 5, 2010, with Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. (Janssen) relating to potential future development milestones and sales of Janssen’s investigational fixed-dose combination of Invokana® (canagliflozin) and extended-release metformin worldwide; (iii) the Non-Exclusive License, Covenant Not to Sue and Right of Reference Agreement, effective as of July 21, 2009, with Merck & Co., Inc. relating to sales of Janumet XR® (sitagliptin and metformin HCL extended-release) worldwide; (iv) the Commercialization Agreement, effective as of August 22, 2011, with Santarus, Inc. relating to sales of Glumetza® (metformin HCL extended-release tablets) in the United States; (v) the Amended License Agreement, effective as of January 9, 2007, with LG Life Sciences Ltd. relating to sales of extended-release metformin in Korea; and (vi) the Amended and Restated License Agreement (Extended Release Metformin Formulations — Canada), dated as of December 13, 2005, with Biovail Laboratories International SRL relating to sales of extended-release metformin in Canada. Under the Royalty Purchase Agreement, PDL was entitled to receive all payments due under such license agreements until PDL received $481 million, after which all net payments received were to be shared evenly between us and PDL. In August 2018, we amended the Royalty Purchase Agreement and sold our remaining interest in such payments to PDL for $20.0 million.
Segment and Customer Information
We maintain one operating segment and have operations solely in the United States. To date, substantially all of our revenues from product sales are related to sales in the United States. 
The three large, national wholesale distributors represent the vast majority of our product sales and represented the percentages of product shipments and consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 set forth below. Further, as described above, we entered into a Commercialization Agreement with Collegium pursuant to which we granted Collegium the right to commercialize the NUCYNTA franchise of pain products in the United States, effective January 
5

9, 2018. We receive a royalty on all NUCYNTA revenues based on certain net sales thresholds, which royalties represented the following percentage of consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Marketing and Sales

We have developed capabilities in various aspects relating to the commercialization of our marketed products, including sales, marketing, manufacturing, quality assurance, wholesale distribution, managed market contracting, government price reporting, medical affairs, compliance, and regulatory. Members of our commercial organization are also engaged in the commercial and marketing assessments of other potential product candidates.

Our neurology sales organization includes approximately 90 full time sales representatives, approximately half of whom are our employees and the balance of whom are employees of a contract sales organization. Our neurology sales force primarily calls on neurologists, pain specialists and primary care physicians, and their affiliated physician assistants and nurse practitioners, throughout most of the United States. Our marketing organization is comprised of professionals who have developed a variety of marketing techniques and programs to promote our products, including promotional materials, industry publications, advertising and other media.
Seasonality
Our product revenues for Gralise, CAMBIA and Zipsor have historically been lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year. This variation is influenced by both wholesaler buying patterns and the reset of annual limits on deductibles and out-of-pocket costs of many health insurance plans and government programs at the beginning of each calendar year. For additional information, please also refer to “Item 1A, Risk Factors - Our product revenues have historically been lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year, which may cause our stock price to decline.”
Manufacturing

Our facility is used for office purposes. No commercial manufacturing takes place at our facility.

We are responsible for the supply and distribution of our marketed products. We have manufacturing and supply agreements with sole commercial suppliers for each of our marketed products, as follows: for Gralise, with Patheon Puerto Rico Inc. (Patheon); for CAMBIA, with MiPharm, S.p.A. (MiPharm); for Zipsor, with Catalent Ontario Limited (Catalent); for NUCYTNA ER, with an affiliate of Janssen Pharma; and for NUCYNTA, with Halo Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Halo).
We have one qualified supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient in each of our marketed products.  We have supply agreements with the suppliers of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in each of our marketed products. We also obtain polyethylene oxide, one of the excipients common to Gralise and products under development by our partners. We currently have no long term supply arrangement with respect to polyethylene oxide.
For additional information regarding our manufacturing, please also refer to “Item 1A, Risk Factors - We depend on third parties that are single source suppliers to manufacture our products. If these suppliers are unable to manufacture and supply our products, or if there is insufficient availability of our products or the raw materials necessary to manufacture our products, our business will suffer.”

Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technologies. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary rights, by among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to cover certain aspects of our technology. In addition to those patents noted on the above table, we have one patent application pending in the U.S. Our pending patent application may lack priority over other applications or may not result in the issuance of a patent. Even if issued, our patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide protection against competitors with similar technologies and may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or may not provide us with competitive advantages against competing products. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how, which are difficult to protect. We seek to protect such information, in part, through entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborative partners and others before such persons or entities have access to our proprietary trade secrets and know how. These confidentiality agreements may not be effective in certain cases. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies.”
Competition
General. We believe that we compete favorably in our markets on the basis of the safety and efficacy of our products. However, competition in pharmaceutical products is intense, and we expect competition to increase. There may be other companies developing products competitive with ours of which we are unaware. Many of our principal competitors have greater financial, sales, marketing, personnel and research and development resources than we do. Competing products developed in the future may prove superior to our products, either generally or in particular market segments. These developments could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete.

Gralise. Gabapentin is currently sold by Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) as Neurontin® and by several generic manufacturers for adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures and for the management of PHN (postherpetic neuralgia). In addition, Pfizer’s product Lyrica® (pregabalin) has been approved for marketing in the United States for the management of PHN, neuropathic pain associated with DPN (diabetic peripheral neuropathy), neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury, fibromyalgia, and adjunctive therapy in partial onset seizures. In January 2018, Pfizer began to sell Lyrica® CR a controlled release formulation of Lyrica® for neuropathic pain associated with DPN and for PHN. Gralise competes against these products and other neuropathic pain treatments, such as anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, local anesthetics used as regional nerve blockers, anti-arrhythmics and opioids. Arbor Pharmaceutical, LLC.’s Horizant™ (gabapentin enacarbil extended-release tablets) product, a prodrug of gabapentin, is also marketed for the management of PHN in the U.S. as well as for Restless Leg Syndrome.
CAMBIA. Diclofenac, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in CAMBIA, is a NSAID approved in the United States for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. CAMBIA competes with a number of triptans which are used to treat acute migraine and certain other headaches. Currently, eight triptans are available generically and sold in the United States (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan). Branded competitors include Zomig® Nasal Spray, Onzetra®, Xsail®, Sumavel®, Zembrace™ SymTouch™ and Treximet®, which is a fixed dose combination product containing sumatriptan and naproxen. There are other products prescribed for or under development for the treatment or prevention of migraines that are now or may become competitive with CAMBIA, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitor products.
Zipsor. Diclofenac, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Zipsor, is a NSAID that is approved in the United States for relief of mild to moderate acute pain. Both branded and generic versions of diclofenac are marketed in the United States. Zipsor competes against other drugs that are widely used to treat mild to moderate acute pain. In addition, a number of other companies are developing NSAIDs in a variety of dosage forms for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and related indications. Other drugs are in clinical development to treat acute pain.
NUCYNTA ER (tapentadol extended release tablets). NUCYNTA ER competes against other long‑acting opioid medications. Those include, among others: OxyContin® (oxycodone hydrochloride extended‑release tablets); Butrans® (buprenorphine); Belbuca™ (buprenorphine buccal film); Hysingla® ER (hydrocodone bitartrate); Xtampza® ER (oxycodone); Zohydro® ER (hydrocodone bitartrate); Embeda® (morphine sulfate and naltrexone hcl); Arymo® ER (morphine sulfate); MorphaBond™ ER (morphine sulfate); and numerous generically available long‑acting opioids. New products continue to be developed and approved, such as Pfizer’s Troxyca, Teva’s Vantrela and Daiichi-Sankyo’s RoxyBond.
NUCYNTA (tapentadol). NUCYNTA (tapentadol) competes primarily against other short‑acting opioids. There are numerous such medicines, including, among others: Oxaydo® (oxycodone hcl); generic oxycodone hcl; generic oxycodone acetaminophen; generic oxymorphone; generic hydrocodone acetaminophen; generic hydromorphone; generic morphine; generic tramadol hcl and generic tramadol acetaminophen. New short-acting opioids continue to be developed and approved.
Government Regulation
Product Development

Numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries regulate our research and development activities and those of our collaborative partners. Governmental approval is required of all potential pharmaceutical products prior to the commercial use of those products. The regulatory process takes several years and requires substantial funds. 

8

In the U.S., the FDA rigorously regulates pharmaceutical products. If a company fails to comply with applicable requirements, the FDA or the courts may impose sanctions. These sanctions may include civil penalties, criminal prosecution of the company or its officers and employees, injunctions, product seizure or detention, product recalls, and total or partial suspension of production. The FDA may withdraw approved applications or refuse to approve pending new drug applications, premarket approval applications, or supplements to approved applications.

We may be required to conduct preclinical testing on laboratory animals of new pharmaceutical products prior to commencement of clinical studies involving human beings. These studies evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product. If preclinical testing is required, we must submit the results of the studies to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug Application, which must become effective before beginning clinical testing in humans.

Some of the products we have developed have been submitted for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (FDCA), which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch‑Waxman Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. For instance, the NDA for Gralise relies on the FDA’s prior approval of Neurontin® (gabapentin), the immediate release formulation of gabapentin initially approved by the FDA.

Typically, human clinical evaluation involves a time‑consuming and costly three‑phase process:


• | In Phase 1, we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drug’s early safety profile and its pharmacokinetic pattern.


• | In Phase 2, we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and further evidence of safety.


• | In Phase 3, we conduct large‑scale, multi‑center, comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product candidate, as required by the FDA.

The FDA closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing. The FDA may, at its discretion, re‑evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to patients. The FDA may also require additional clinical trials after approvals, which are known as Phase 4 trials.

The results of preclinical and clinical testing are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, for approval prior to commercialization. An NDA requires that our products are compliant with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). Failure to achieve or maintain cGMP standards for our products would adversely impact their marketability.
In responding to an NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application.

Foreign regulatory approval of a product must also be obtained prior to marketing the product internationally. Foreign approval procedures vary from country to country. The time required for approval may delay or prevent marketing in certain countries. In certain instances we or our collaborative partners may seek approval to market and sell certain products outside of the United States before submitting an application for United States approval to the FDA. The clinical testing requirements and the time required to obtain foreign regulatory approvals may differ from that required for FDA approval. Although there is now a centralized European Union (EU) approval mechanism in place, each EU country may nonetheless impose its own procedures and requirements. Many of these procedures and requirements are time‑consuming and expensive. Some EU countries require price approval as part of the regulatory process. These constraints can cause substantial delays in obtaining required approval from both the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities after the relevant applications are filed, and approval in any single country may not meaningfully indicate that another country will approve the product.

Reimbursement

Sales of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. depend in significant part on the extent of coverage and reimbursement from government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as other third party payers. Third party payers are undertaking significant efforts to control the cost of pharmaceutical products, including by implementing cost containment measures to control, restrict access to, or influence the purchase of drugs, and other health care products and services.

9

Government programs may regulate reimbursement, pricing, and coverage of products in order to control costs or to affect levels of use of certain products. Private health insurance plans may exclude or restrict coverage of some products, such as by using payer formularies under which only selected drugs are covered, variable co‑payments that make drugs that are not preferred by the payer more expensive for patients, and by employing utilization management controls, such as requirements for prior authorization or prior failure on another type of treatment.

Fraud and Abuse

Pharmaceutical companies that participate in federal healthcare programs are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti‑kickback and false claims laws. Violations of U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid).

Federal statutes that apply to us include the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration in exchange for or to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a drug, that is reimbursable by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the Federal False Claims Act (FCA), which generally prohibits knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to the federal government any false, fraudulent or medically unnecessary claims for reimbursed drugs or services. Government enforcement agencies and private whistleblowers have asserted liability under the FCA for claims submitted involving inadequate care, kickbacks, improper promotion of off‑label uses and misreporting of drug prices to federal agencies.

Similar state laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non‑governmental payers, including private insurers. These state laws may be broader in scope than their federal analogues, such as state false claims laws that apply where a claim is submitted to any third‑party payer, regardless of whether the payer is a private health insurer or a government healthcare program, and state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to certify compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines.

Federal and state authorities have increased enforcement of fraud and abuse laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the law and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the FCA and under state and local laws. These laws are broad in scope and there may not be regulations, guidance, or court decisions that definitively interpret these laws and apply them to particular industry practices. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change.
Prescription Limitations

Many states, including the Commonwealths of Massachusetts  and Virginia and the States of New York, Ohio, Arizona, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rode Island, Colorado, Wisconsin, Alabama, South Carolina, Washington and New Jersey, have either recently enacted, intend to enact, or have pending legislation or regulations designed to, among other things, limit the duration and quantity of initial prescriptions of immediate release form of opiates (such as NUCYNTA), mandate the use by prescribers of prescription drug databases and mandate prescriber education.  These and other state and local laws applicable to the pharmaceutical industry may affect our business and operations as well as those of our commercialization and development partners.
Controlled Substances

Tapentadol (Federal and State). The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is the federal agency responsible for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA).  The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in the United States and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. Except for research and industrial purposes, a pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Tapentadol, the active ingredient in NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER, is listed by the DEA as a Schedule II substance under the CSA. Consequently, its manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation.

Registration with the DEA is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports a controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For

example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized to be handled under that registration.

The availability and production of all Schedule II substances, including tapentadol, is limited by the DEA through a quota system that includes a national aggregate quota, production quotas for individual manufacturers and procurement quotas that authorize the procurement of specific quantities of Schedule II controlled substances for use in drug product manufacturing. The DEA annually establishes an aggregate quota for total tapentadol production in the U.S. based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet commercial and scientific need. The aggregate quota of tapentadol that the DEA allows to be produced in the U.S. is allocated among applicable individual drug manufacturers, which must submit applications at least annually to the DEA for individual production quotas. In turn, the manufacturers of NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER, which are third party contract manufacturers, have to obtain a procurement quota to source tapentadol for the production of NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER.

The DEA requires substantial evidence and documentation of expected legitimate medical and scientific needs before assigning quotas for these activities. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. The DEA may also require drug manufactures to submit applications for individual production quota on a rolling basis.

Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we, as well as our third party active pharmaceutical ingredient suppliers and manufacturers, are subject to such regulation by several states with respect to the manufacture and distribution of these products.
Gabapentin (State). There has been recent regulatory attention focused on gabapentin as a result of a perceived risk of the compound being used as a potentiator for opioid abuse. Although gabapentin is neither an opioid nor classified as a controlled substance by the DEA, as a result of the perceived risks relating to opioid abuse, several states (Tennessee, West Virginia, Kentucky and Michigan) have scheduled gabapentin as a Schedule V substance.  As a result, we, as well as our third party active pharmaceutical ingredient suppliers and manufacturers, are subject to regulation by these states with respect to the manufacture and distribution of Gralise (gabapentin).
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA) contains provisions that have or could potentially impact our business, including (a) an increase in the minimum Medicaid rebate to states participating in the Medicaid program on branded prescription drugs; (b) the extension of the Medicaid rebate to managed care organizations that dispense drugs to Medicaid beneficiaries; and (c) the expansion of the 340B Public Health Service Act drug pricing program (340B Program), which provides outpatient drugs at reduced rates, to include certain children’s hospitals, free standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals and rural referral centers.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the Sunshine Act) provisions, enacted in 2010 as part of ACA, require pharmaceutical manufacturers, among others, to disclose annually to the federal government (for re‑disclosure to the public) certain payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare practitioners or to teaching hospitals. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures and impose penalties for failures to disclose. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements. As a result of the ambiguity in certain of these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations.

Our operations and business are subject to a number of other laws and regulations, including those relating to the workplace, privacy, laboratory practices and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances as well as controlled substances. In addition, state laws may also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances and may contain different or broader privacy protections than the federal provisions.
