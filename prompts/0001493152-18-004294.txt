ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Our Corporate History
 
We are a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Nevada. The original business started in 1993 as Ferris Productions, Inc. In September 2001, Ferris Productions, Inc. merged with GameCom, Inc. to ultimately become VirTra Systems, Inc., a Texas corporation.
 
Effective as of October 1, 2016 (the “Effective Date”), we completed a conversion from a Texas corporation to a Nevada corporation pursuant to a Redomestication Plan of Conversion (the “Plan of Conversion”) that was approved by our Board of Directors on June 23, 2016 and our shareholders on September 16, 2016. On the Effective Date, 7,927,774  shares of common stock of VirTra Systems, Inc., a Texas corporation, were converted into 7,927,774 shares of common stock of VirTra, Inc., a Nevada corporation. No shareholders exercised appraisal rights or dissenters’ rights for such shares in accordance with the Texas Business Organization Code.
 
As part of the Plan of Conversion, we filed Articles of Incorporation in Nevada whereby we changed our name from VirTra Systems, Inc. to VirTra, Inc. and revised our capitalization. Our Articles of Incorporation filed in Nevada authorize us to issue 62,500,000 shares, of which (1) 60,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), of which (a) 50,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock, par value $0.0001, (b) 2,500,000 shares shall be Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and (c) 7,500,000 shares shall be Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class B Common Stock”) and (2) 2,500,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which may, at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors be issued in one or more series (the “Preferred Stock”). We also adopted new bylaws as part of the Plan of Conversion.

Effective October 20, 2016, we effected a 1 for 10 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding Common Stock and effective February 12, 2018 we effected a 1 for 2 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding Common Stock (together the “Reverse Stock Splits”). All references to shares of our Common Stock in this report on Form 10-K refer to the number of shares of Common Stock after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Splits and are presented as if the Reverse Stock Splits had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
 
Pursuant to an Offering Circular on Form 1-A, as amended, pursuant to Regulation A, we offered on a “best efforts” basis a minimum of 714,286 shares of common stock and a maximum of 1,428,571 shares of common stock (the “Offered Shares”), par value of $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), at a price per share of Common Stock of $7.00. The minimum offering amount (“Minimum Offering Amount”) was $5,000,000 and the maximum offering amount (“Maximum Offering Amount”) was $10,000,000. We terminated the offering on March 29, 2018. No shares were sold pursuant to the offering.
 
On March 29, 2018, our shares of Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol, “VTSI.”

Business Overview
 
We develop, sell and support use of force training and marksmanship firearms training systems and accessories for law enforcement, military, educational or civilian use. Our simulators use software, hardware and content to create uniquely effective and realistic training that does not require live ammunition or less-than-lethal munitions, which can both save money and provide certain training capabilities unavailable to live fire exercises. We have developed a higher standard in simulation training including capabilities such as: multi-screen video based scenarios, unique scenario authoring ability, superior training scenarios, the patented Threat-Fire™ shoot-back system, powerful gas-powered simulated recoil weapons, and more.
 
The VirTra simulator allows marksmanship and realistic scenario based training to take place on a daily basis without the need for a shooting range, protective equipment, role players, safety officers, or a scenario based training site. The simulator also allows students to receive immediate feedback from the instructor without the potential for sustaining injuries by the instructor or the students. The instructor is able to teach and re-mediate critical issues, while placing realistic stress on the students due to the realism and safe training environment created by the VirTra simulator.
 
We also are engaged in licensing our technology to Modern Round Entertainment Corporation (“MREC”), a developer and operator of a combined dining and entertainment concept centered on an indoor shooting experience (the “MREC Concept”).
 
Business Strategy
 
We have four main customer groups, namely, law enforcement, military, educational (includes colleges and police academies) and civilian. These are very different markets and require different sales and marketing programs as well as personnel. Our focus is to expand the market share and scope of our training simulators sales to these identified customer groups by pursuing the following key growth strategies:

● | Build Our Core Business. Our goal is to profitably grow our market share by continuing to develop, produce and market the most effective simulators possible. Through disciplined growth in our business, we have achieved a solid balance sheet by increasing our working capital and limiting our bank debt. We plan to add staff to our experienced management team as needed to meet the expected increase in demand for our products and services as we increase our marketing and sales activities. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increase Total Addressable Market. We plan to increase the size of our total addressable market. This effort will focus on new marketing and new product and/or service offerings for the purpose of widening the number of types of customers who might consider our products or services uniquely compelling. 


● | Broaden Product Offerings. Since formation in 1993, our company has had a proud tradition of innovation in the field of simulation and virtual reality. We plan to release revolutionary new products and services as well as continue incremental improvements to existing product lines. In some cases, the company may enter a new market segment via the introduction of a new type of product or service. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Partners and Acquisitions. We try to spend our time and funds wisely and not tackle tasks that can be done more efficiently with partners. For example, international distribution is often best accomplished through a local distributor or agent. We are also open to the potential of acquiring additional businesses or of being acquired ourselves, based on what is expected to be optimal for our long-term future and our shareholders.

Modern Round
 
On the civilian side, we have a Co-venture agreement with Modern Round, Inc. (formerly, Modern Round, LLC) (“Modern Round”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Modern Round Entertainment Corporation (“MREC”), a developer and operator of a combined dining and entertainment concept centered on an indoor shooting experience. MREC plans to roll out its entertainment concept nationally and currently operates one virtual shooting lounge facility in Peoria, Arizona. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted Modern Round an exclusive, non-transferable royalty-bearing right and license to use our software in virtual shooting lounge facilities provided that certain minimums are met every year. 
Operations and Suppliers
 
We produce some of our own products. We also rely on a variety of suppliers. Management does not expect to encounter future delays with suppliers that would have a material impact on us. However, supplier delays would adversely affect us.
Competition and Competitive Landscape
 
We compete against a number of established companies that provide similar products and services, some of which have financial, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources significantly greater than ours. There are also companies whose products do not compete directly, but are sometimes closely related to the products we offer. Arotech, Inc., Cubic, Inc., Laser Shot, Inc., Meggitt Training Systems, and Ti Training Corp are our main competitors in some or all of our markets.
 
We believe that our products and services are superior to those offered by our competitors based on our strength in developing higher quality software solutions and our extensive library of virtual shooting scenario content that would require a substantial investment by a competitor to offer a comparable product.
 
Modern Round Co-Venture Agreement
 
On January 16, 2015 we entered into a Co-Venture Agreement (the “Co-Venture Agreement”) with Modern Round. We agreed to develop interactive games, skills drills, and advanced training simulation content for Modern Round pursuant to the terms of the Co-Venture Agreement, the costs of which were born by Modern Round. We also licensed our software, virtual shooting content and other intellectual property (the “VirTra Technology”) to Modern Round for a portion of its total revenue. We continue to own virtual shooting scenario content that is used in conjunction with the Modern Round platform, whether such content is created by a third-party developer or by Modern Round’s in-house development team. When a virtual shooting scenario content is used in conjunction with the Modern Round’s platform, however, Modern Round has an exclusive, worldwide license to use such content, whether created by a third-party developer or by Modern Round’s in-house development team subject to certain milestones discussed below.

The Co-Venture Agreement provided for (i) the grant to us of 1,365,789 membership units of Modern Round (“Units”), (ii) a right to participate to the extent of five percent of any offering by Modern Round of its Units, (iii) warrants to purchase 1,365,789 Units exercisable 12 months after the opening of Modern Round’s first range facility utilizing the VirTra technology pursuant to the Co-Venture Agreement at a price of $0.25 per share and (iv) Modern Round’s payment of a royalty to us equal to 7% of its gross revenues for each location that uses the VirTra Technology with minimum royalty payments of $280,000, $560,000, and $840,000 (thereafter) for each 12-month period following the opening of the first location in the United States or Canada based on sales in these territories and separate minimum royalty payments, following the opening of the first location outside of the United States and Canada, each based on sales in each of the respective territories.
 
In addition, on April 14, 2015 Modern Round issued to us an option to purchase 125,000 of its Units. The option fully vested and became exercisable on the date of grant at an exercise price equal to $0.50 per Unit. The April 14, 2015 option terminates on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant, if not earlier pursuant to the terms of the option.
 
Modern Round’s exclusive license is conditional upon achieving certain milestones. They are required to open a location in the United States or Canada within 24 months, and are required to open an international location within five years of the execution of the Co-Venture Agreement. Additionally, they must meet the minimum royalty payments noted when they become effective. They achieved the United States or Canada milestone with the opening of their Peoria, Arizona location in June 2016. The term of the Co-Venture Agreement continues so long as Modern Round exercises any rights under the agreement with respect to the VirTra Technology. The Co-Venture Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party if the breaching party fails to cure any material breach within 30 days after written notice from the non-breaching party. If we are the breaching party, Modern Round may elect to retain the right to use the VirTra Technology and continue to pay royalties to us as provided for in the Co-Venture Agreement.
 
In addition to our other obligations under the Co-Venture Agreement, we issued to affiliates of MREC warrants to purchase 459,691 shares of our Common Stock exercisable at $2.72 per share any time subsequent to the earlier of the first anniversary of the opening of Modern Round’s first range facility utilizing the VirTra Technology or after MREC opens its first range facility utilizing VirTra Technology and the payment of all required minimum royalty payments during the first 12-month period. These warrants became exercisable on June 1, 2017. We also granted warrants to affiliates of MREC to purchase 459,691 shares of our Common Stock exercisable at $2.72 per share any time subsequent to Modern Round’s payment to us of $2,000,000 in royalty fees. These warrants are not yet exercisable.
 
On December 31, 2015, Modern Round merged with a subsidiary of MREC pursuant to a Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) and each unit of Modern Round issued and outstanding as of the effective time of the merger automatically converted into the right to receive approximately 1.2277 shares of MREC common stock. As a result of the Merger Agreement, we held 1,676,748 shares of MREC, options to purchase 153,459 shares of MREC common stock at an exercise price of $0.41 per share, and conditional warrants to purchase 1,676,747 shares of MREC common stock at an exercise price of $0.20 per share. On October 25, 2016, we exercised the warrant and purchased 1,676,747 shares of MREC common stock for $335,349 resulting in our aggregate holdings of MREC increasing to 3,353,495 common shares representing approximately 8.9% of the issued and outstanding common shares of MREC.
 
On July 28, 2017, the Company received Notices of Exercise for all 459,691 warrants then exercisable (the “Tranche 1 Warrants”) from all the MREC affiliate holders electing to purchase warrants pursuant to the terms of the net exercise provision set forth in the Warrant Agreement. Mr. Saltz (a member of our Board of Directors who is also Chairman of the Board of Directors of MREC, as well as a majority stockholder of MREC) held 398,122 of the Tranche 1 Warrants prior to the assignment of the warrants to MREC on August 11, 2017. Under the net exercise provision, in lieu of exercising the warrant for cash, the holder may elect to receive shares equal to the value of the warrant (or the portion thereof being exercised) by surrender of the warrant and the Company issuing to holder the number of computed shares. Using the July 28, 2017 OTCQX closing price at $4.36 as fair value and the $2.72 warrant exercise price, upon conversion the 459,691 warrants entitled the holders to receive 172,912 shares of the Company’s Common Stock without payment of any additional consideration pursuant to the net exercise terms of the Tranche 1 Warrants that are currently exercisable.

Effective August 16, 2017, the Company and the MREC affiliate holders entered into an agreement (the “Warrant Buyout Agreement”) whereby the Company acknowledged that the affiliates of MREC had assigned the Tranche 1 Warrants to MREC and the Company agreed to repurchase them at a price of $3.924 per share of Common Stock issuable by the Company pursuant to the net exercise terms of the Warrants for a total of $678,505.
 
In addition, the Company agreed to repurchase from MREC an additional 459,691 warrants held by MREC that are not currently exercisable (the “Tranche 2 Warrants”). Mr. Saltz held 364,122 of the Tranche 2 Warrants prior to their assignment to MREC on August 11, 2017. The Warrant Buyout Agreement amended the Tranche 2 Warrants to provide for the immediate exercise on a net exercise basis of 24,208 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The aggregate purchase price for the Tranche 2 Warrants is $94,990 based on a price of $3.924 per share of Common Stock issuable on a net exercise basis and based on 24,208 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The aggregate purchase price of the Tranche 1 Warrants and the Tranche 2 Warrants was $773,495.
 
MREC agreed that proceeds of the warrant redemption, net of applicable taxes, would be used to fund the development of a second stand-alone Modern Round location. In addition, MREC agreed that, after giving effect to their payment to us of $161,573 towards the $280,000 minimum royalty due covering the first 12-month royalty period, the balance due to us in order to maintain exclusivity was $118,427.
 
In addition, on August 16, 2017, we entered into an amendment to the Co-Venture Agreement to permit MREC to sublicense the VirTra Technology to third party operators of stand-alone location-based entertainment companies. MREC agreed to pay us royalties for any such sublicenses in an amount equal to 10% of the revenue paid to MREC in cases where MREC pays for the cost of the equipment for such location or 14% of the revenue paid to MREC in cases where it does not pay for the cost of the equipment.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We own or have rights to trademarks or trade names that we use in connection with the operation of our business, including our corporate names, logos and website names. In addition, we own or have the rights to copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary rights that protect the content of our products and the formulations for such products. This Annual Report may also contain trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies, which are the property of their respective owners. Our use or display of third parties’ trademarks, service marks, trade names or products in this Annual Report is not intended to, and should not be read to, imply a relationship with or endorsement or sponsorship of us. Solely for convenience, some of the copyrights, trade names and trademarks referred to in this Annual Report are listed without their ©, ® and ™ symbols, but we will assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights to our copyrights, trade names and trademarks. All other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.
 
We rely on certain proprietary technology and seek to protect our interests through a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and security measures, including confidentiality agreements. Our policy generally is to secure protection for significant innovations to the fullest extent practicable. Further, we seek to expand and improve the technological base and individual features of our products through ongoing research and development programs.

Research and Development
 
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our research and product development expenses were approximately $1,285,000 and $1,100,000, respectively.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials/Manufacturing and Assembly
 
We obtain the key components of our products from a variety of sources that we purchase on a purchase order basis from local suppliers at market prices based on our production requirements. We believe alternative sources generally exist for the components used in our products.
 
Our manufacturing, assembly, warehouse and shipping facilities are located in Tempe Arizona. See Business – Property.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 80 full-time employees. We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees and we do not currently have any labor disputes.
Property
 
We lease approximately 37,729 rentable square feet of office and warehouse space from an unaffiliated third party for our corporate office, manufacturing, assembly, warehouse and shipping facility located at 7970 South Kyrene Road, Tempe, Arizona 85284. This lease expires in April 2019. In addition, we lease approximately 4,529 rentable square feet of office and industrial space from an unaffiliated third party for our parts manufacturing facility at 2169 East 5th St., Tempe, Arizona 85284. This lease expires in September 2018.
Operations
 
Our operations are conducted from our principal executive office in Tempe, Arizona. We have no offices or employees internationally. However, our U.S.-based sales force works to secure contracts to supply our products in U.S. and foreign markets. As of December 31, 2017, we had existing sales contracts or warranty service obligations in the U.S. and 10 foreign countries. When our products are introduced into an international market, it is either pursuant to a contract directly with a customer located in the foreign country, or pursuant to a contract between our company and a U.S. government agency (such as the Department of State or the United States Army). In the latter instance, our customer is the relevant U.S. government agency. The government agency may then distribute our products to third parties within the particular country.
Regulatory Matters
 
Our business is heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including, but not limited to, branches of the U.S. military and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our international markets.
 
We are also subject to export laws and regulations. These laws include, among others, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the “ITAR”), administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, and trade sanctions, regulations and embargoes administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control. Among its many provisions, the ITAR requires a license application for the export of firearms and congressional approval for any application with a total value of $1 million or higher. We have been issued an exemption under the ITAR that eliminates the need to apply for individual licenses to export our products outside the United States.

Any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties. Any changes in export regulations may further restrict the export of our products. The length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Any restrictions on the export of our products could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.
 
For additional information related to export regulations, see Item 1A, entitled “Risk Factors – We may not be able to receive or retain the necessary licenses or authorizations required for us to export or re-export….”
 
Government Contracts
 
The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default, based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. For additional information related to government contracts, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Government Contracts.”
Environmental
 
We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.
