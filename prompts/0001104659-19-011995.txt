Item 1.                                 Business
 
Dover Motorsports, Inc. is a public holding company that is a leading marketer and promoter of motorsports entertainment in the United States.  Through our subsidiaries, we own and operate Dover International Speedway® in Dover, Delaware and Nashville Superspeedway® near Nashville, Tennessee.  Our Dover facility promoted the following six events during 2018, all of which were under the auspices of the premier sanctioning body in motorsports - the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR):
 
·                  2 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series events (May and October);
 ·                  2 NASCAR XFINITY Series events (May and October);
 ·                  1 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series event (May); and
 ·                  1 NASCAR K&N Pro Series East event (October).
 
In 2019, we celebrate our 50th anniversary of NASCAR racing and we are scheduled to once again promote these six events at Dover International Speedway, together with many special fan amenities to mark this historic milestone. Total revenues from these events were approximately 96%, 96% and 97% of total revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
We have hosted the Firefly Music Festival (Firefly) on our property in Dover, Delaware for seven consecutive years and it is scheduled to return on June 21-23, 2019.  The inaugural three day festival with 40 musical acts was held in July 2012 and the 2018 event was held on June 14-17, 2018 with approximately 120 musical acts.  In September 2014, Red Frog Events LLC formed RFGV Festivals LLC - a joint venture with Goldenvoice that promotes Firefly.  Goldenvoice is a company of AEG Presents, LLC, a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc.  AEG Presents, one of the worlds largest presenters of live music and entertainment events, announced on July 18, 2018 that it had acquired the remainder of RFGV Festivals LLC from Red Frog.  Our amended agreement with RFGV Festivals grants them two 5 year options to extend our facility rental agreement through 2032 in exchange for a rental commitment to secure our property.  In addition to the facility rental fee, we also receive a percentage of the concession sales we manage at the events.
 
We generate revenues primarily from the following sources:
 
·                  rights fees obtained for television and radio broadcasts of our events;
 ·                  ticket sales;
 ·                  sponsorship payments;
 ·                  luxury suite rentals;
 ·                  hospitality tent rentals and catering;
 ·                  concessions and vendor commissions for the right to sell concessions and souvenirs at our facilities;
 ·                  expo space rentals; and
 ·                  track and facility rentals and other event-related revenues.
 
We began our motorsports operations in 1969 in Dover, Delaware.  Our predecessor, Dover Downs, Inc., was also engaged in harness horse racing operations and later ran our other gaming operations.  As a result of several restructurings, our operations were segregated into two main operating subsidiaries - Dover International Speedway, Inc., incorporated in 1994, encompassed our motorsports operations, and Dover Downs, Inc., incorporated in 1967, conducted our gaming operations.
 
Effective March 31, 2002, we spun-off our gaming business which was then owned by our subsidiary, Dover Downs Gaming & Entertainment, Inc. (Gaming).  On a tax-free basis, we made a pro rata distribution of all of the capital stock of Gaming to our stockholders.  Our continuing operations subsequent to the spin-off consist solely of our motorsports activities and property rentals.

Nashville Superspeedway no longer promotes motorsports events and has not entered into sanction agreements with NASCAR since 2011.  We lease the facility on a short term basis to third parties from time to time.             On August 17, 2017, we entered into an agreement with an entity owned by Panattoni Development Company relative to the sale of approximately 147 acres of land at a purchase price of $35,000 per acre.  On March 2, 2018, we closed on the sale of the property with proceeds, less closing costs, of $4,945,000.  Net proceeds after taxes were approximately $4,150,000.  On September 1, 2017, we also awarded to the purchaser a three year option for 88.03 additional acres at a purchase price of $55,000 per acre.  On February 9, 2018, we amended the option agreement to extend its term and to add additional acreage to the option.  The option is for three years beginning March 1, 2018.  An additional 86.45 acres were added to the option at a purchase price of $66,685 per acre and an additional 50.51 acres were added at a purchase price of $35,000 per acre.  The option may only be exercised for all of the 224.99 acres at one time for a total purchase price of $12,374,000.  While management remains committed to selling the remaining Nashville Superspeedway property which consists of over 1,000 acres, we do not believe it is probable that the remaining property will be sold within the next twelve months.  At December 31, 2018, $23,567,000 was reported as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  At December 31, 2017, $2,455,000 representing 147 acres of the total Nashville Superspeedway property was reported as assets held for sale and $23,545,000 was reported as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
 
In September 2018, we entered into negotiations to sell a parcel of land we own near St. Louis.  The sale closed in January 2019 with proceeds, less closing costs, of $531,000.  As a result, we recorded a loss of $99,000 on sale of land in our consolidated statements of earnings for 2018.  At December 31, 2018, $531,000 representing the fair value of the land is reported as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets.
 
Dover International Speedway
 
We have promoted NASCAR-sanctioned racing events for 50 consecutive years at Dover International Speedway and currently promote six NASCAR-sanctioned events at the facility annually.  Two races are in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series professional stock car racing circuit, two races are in the NASCAR XFINITY Series racing circuit, one race is in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series racing circuit and one race is in the NASCAR K&N Pro Series East racing circuit.  Prior to 2017, the NASCAR Cup Series was sponsored by Sprint.
 
Each of the NASCAR XFINITY Series events, the Camping World Truck Series event and the K&N Pro Series East event at Dover International Speedway are conducted on the days before a Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series event.  Dover International Speedway is one of only eight speedways in North America that presents two Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series events and two NASCAR XFINITY Series events each year.  Additionally, it is one of only nine tracks to host three major NASCAR events at one facility on the same weekend.  The spring and fall event dates have historically allowed Dover International Speedway to hold the first and last Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series events in the Maryland to Maine region each year.  Our fall event was the fourth of ten races in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Playoff, an elimination format which determines the NASCAR Cup Series champion for the racing season.  Starting in 2018, the XFINITY Series and the Camping World Truck Series also moved to a playoff format.  Our fall XFINITY Series event was the third of seven races in the NASCAR XFINITY Series Playoff.
 
Dover International Speedway, widely known as the Monster Mile®, is a high-banked, one-mile, concrete superspeedway with permanent grandstand seating capacity of approximately 85,000.  Unlike some superspeedways, substantially all grandstand and skybox seats offer an unobstructed view of the entire track.  The concrete racing surface makes Dover International Speedway the only concrete superspeedway (one mile or greater in length) that conducts Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series events.  The superspeedway facility also features the Monster Bridge®.  The climate controlled bridge spans across the width of the superspeedway at a height of 29 feet and houses 50-luxury seats, a refreshment bar and other amenities.  The Monster Bridge is the only one of its kind in the motorsports industry.
 
Agreements with NASCAR
 
Our most recent sanction agreements with NASCAR are for a five year period (2016-2020).  Pursuant to the typical sanction agreement, NASCAR grants its sanction to a promoter, such as Dover International Speedway, to organize, promote and hold a particular competition.  The promoter sells tickets to the competition, sells or arranges

for the sale of merchandise and concessions, and sells advertising, sponsorships and hospitality services.  NASCAR conducts the competition, arranges for the drivers, and has sole control over the competition, including the right to require alterations to the promoters facility and the right to approve or disapprove any advertising or sponsorship of the promoter.  NASCAR also has exclusive rights to exploit live broadcast and certain broadcast and intellectual property rights related to the competition, and exclusive rights to sponsorship and promotional rights relative to the series to which a particular competition belongs.  The promoter must pay the sanction fee and purse monies and receives a share of the live broadcast revenue contracted for by NASCAR.  The promoter is responsible for the condition of the facility, for compliance with laws, for control of the public, for fire and medical equipment and personnel, for security, for insurance and for providing facilities and services required by NASCAR officials and the live broadcast personnel.
 
Dover International Speedway, Inc. has entered into two sanction agreements with NASCAR pursuant to which it will organize and promote two Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series events in 2016 through 2020.  Our business is substantially dependent on these two agreements.
 
Under the terms of our sanction agreements, NASCAR retains 10% of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each NASCAR-sanctioned event as a component of its sanction fee.  The remaining 90% is recorded as revenue.  The event promoter is required to pay 25% of the gross broadcast rights fees to the event as part of the awards to the competitors, which we record as operating expenses.
 
Competition
 
Our racing events compete with other racing events sanctioned by various racing bodies and with other sports and recreational events scheduled on or around the same dates.  Racing events sanctioned by different organizations are often held on the same dates at different tracks.  The quality of the competition, type of racing event, caliber of the event, sight lines, ticket pricing, location and customer conveniences and amenities, among other things, differentiate the motorsports facilities.  We also compete with improving and expanding media coverage and content by network and cable broadcasters.
Seasonality
 
We derive substantially all of our total revenues from admissions, television broadcast rights and other event-related revenue attributable to two major motorsports event weekends held in the spring and fall.  As a result, our business is highly seasonal.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 47 full-time employees and 7 part-time employees.  We engage temporary personnel to assist during our motorsports racing season.  We believe that we enjoy a good relationship with our employees.
