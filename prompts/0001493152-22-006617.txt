Item 1. Business
 
As used in this report, the terms “Lazydays,” “the Company,” “Holdco,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Lazydays Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires.
 
Overview
 
Andina Acquisition Corp. II (“Andina”) was originally formed for the purpose of effecting a business combination with one or more businesses or entities. On March 15, 2018, the initial business combination was consummated. As a result, the business of Lazy Days’ R.V. Center, Inc. and its subsidiaries became the Company’s business. Accordingly, Lazydays Holdings, Inc. is now a holding company operating through our direct and indirect subsidiaries.
Company History
 
Andina was formed as an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on July 1, 2015 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses.
 
From the consummation of the initial public offering (“IPO”) of Andina until October 27, 2017, Andina was searching for a suitable target business to acquire. On October 27, 2017, a merger agreement was entered into by and among Andina, Andina II Holdco Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Andina (“Holdco”), Andina II Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (“Merger Sub”), Lazy Days’ R.V. Center, Inc. (“Lazydays RV”) and solely for certain purposes set forth in the merger agreement, A. Lorne Weil (the “Merger Agreement”). The Merger Agreement provided for a business combination transaction by means of (i) the merger of Andina with and into Holdco, with Holdco surviving and becoming a new public company (the “Redomestication Merger”) and (ii) the merger of Lazy Days’ R.V. Center, Inc. with and into Merger Sub with Lazy Days’ R.V. Center, Inc. surviving and becoming a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (the “Transaction Merger” and together with the Redomestication Merger, the “Mergers”). On March 15, 2018, Holdco held an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders, at which the Andina shareholders approved the Mergers and other related proposals. On the same date, the Mergers were closed. In connection with the Mergers, the business of Lazy Days’ R.V. Center, Inc. and its subsidiaries became the business of Holdco. As a result of the Mergers, the Company’s stockholders and the shareholders of Andina became stockholders of Holdco and the Company changed the name of Holdco to “Lazydays Holdings, Inc.”

The Company operates one reportable segment, which includes all aspects of our RV dealership operations which include sales of new and pre-owned RVs, assisting customers with vehicle financing and protection plans, servicing and repairing new and pre-owned RVs, sales of RV parts and accessories and campground facilities.

Company Strengths
 
The Iconic Brand. With over forty years of history dating back to 1976, Lazydays is an iconic brand that we believe is synonymous with the RV lifestyle, and is known nationally as The RV Authority ®, a registered trademark. The trademark has been consistently used by the Company in its marketing and branding communications since 2013. Based on a research report prepared by Russell Research in November / December 2017, Lazydays is the second most well-known R.V. dealership brand among a national audience of non-Lazydays customers surveyed. According to the report, over 85% of Lazydays customers and over 80% of prospective customers surveyed believe that Lazydays is among the category leaders in the industry. The Company’s consistent quality, breadth and depth of offerings, as well as its comprehensive range of RV lifestyle resources, have resulted in the Company’s customers having loyalty to, and trust in, the Lazydays brands.
 
Comprehensive RV Products and Services. The Company is a provider of a comprehensive portfolio of RV products, services, third-party protection plans, and resources for RV enthusiasts. The Company represents the top manufacturers in the industry with more than 4,000 RVs available nationwide. Lazydays provides an extensive service and repair offering for all RV brands, with nearly 500 service bays staffed by certified technicians.

Customer Experience. Lazydays target customers are RV enthusiasts who are seeking a lifestyle centered around the RV. Lazydays believes it has built its reputation on providing an outstanding customer experience with exceptional service and product expertise. One of the Company’s primary goals is to create “Customers for Life” by offering a unique purchasing experience that combines its large selection of RV inventory, the Company’s unique scenic facilities with multiple amenities, and its customer focused, process-oriented approach to servicing the customer. Building a welcoming atmosphere that caters to the RV enthusiast community is an intangible element critical to the Company’s success, and the Company’s philosophy is thoroughly ingrained in and continually reinforced throughout its corporate culture at every level. The Company believes that its customer-focused business model has resulted in a loyal, stable and growing customer base, as well as a strong reputation within the RV community.
 
Employee Service and Commitment. Lazydays believes its commitment to ongoing training and talent development has been instrumental in providing employees an outstanding workplace experience and growth opportunities. As a result of this commitment, the Lazydays team of experienced professionals is able to provide an exceptional level of service that we believe is very difficult to replicate and is a significant competitive advantage.
 
In 2005, Lazydays employees formed the Lazydays Employee Foundation (the “Foundation”), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization focused on making a positive impact in the lives of at-risk children. The Foundation is run exclusively by employees as volunteers and members of the Foundation’s board of directors, and their mission is to measurably change the lives of children by instilling hope, inspiring dreams and empowering them with education. Since its inception, the Foundation has donated more than $2 million to help disadvantaged children in Florida, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Tennessee. The Foundation sponsors two facilities in Florida that carry its name; The Lazydays House at a Kids Place which houses foster children in a facility where siblings can remain together and the Lazydays House at Bridging Freedom which houses and rehabilitates children rescued from human trafficking. Lazydays employees also volunteer their time to many worthwhile charities and engage in life enriching activities with at-risk youth. The Foundation has received multiple awards for their philanthropic work, including the national Arthur J. Decio Humanitarian Award for outstanding civic and community outreach in the RV industry.
 
Leading Market Position and Scale. Lazydays believes it is one of the largest RV retailers in the United States. According to a research report prepared by Russell Research in November / December 2017, Lazydays is the second most well-known RV brand among the national audience. We believe the Company’s scale and its long-term stability make it attractive to the Company’s original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), suppliers, financiers and business partners. The Company believes its strong relationship with OEMs and suppliers enables the Company to negotiate attractive product pricing and availability. The Company also aligns with its OEMs on product development in which the Company leverages its customer base to provide feedback on new products. The Company also believes its scale and strong relationship with its financing and insurance partners enable it to offer extensive financing products and insurance plans that fit almost every customer’s needs.
 
Consistent Processes and Procedures. Lazydays utilizes a system of process documentation and implementation called the “Lazydays Way.” Lazydays believes that the Lazydays Way allows it to implement and maintain consistent and efficient operating procedures across all of its dealerships.
 
Variable Cost Structure and Capital Efficient Model. Lazydays flat and decentralized management structure, coupled with incentive programs focused on profitability, have allowed Lazydays to achieve a highly variable cost structure. The Company’s digital marketing and analytics capabilities provide it with flexibility and meaningfully improve its marketing productivity and efficiency via targeted marketing programs. The Company believes its operating model leads to strong and stable margins through economic cycles, resulting in what it believes to be high cash flow generation, low capital expenditure requirements and strong returns on invested capital.
 
Experienced Team. The Lazydays management team has extensive industry and dealership experience. The Company offers highly competitive compensation tightly tied to performance, which has allowed the Company to attract and retain its highly capable team.

Lazydays Product and Service Offerings
 
New and Pre-Owned Vehicles
 
New Vehicles: Lazydays offers a comprehensive selection of new RVs across a wide range of price points, classes and floor plans, from entry level travel trailers to Class A motorhomes, at its dealership locations and on its website. Lazydays has formed strategic alliances with leading RV manufacturers. The core brands that the Company sells, representing 96.0% of the new vehicles that were sold by the Company in 2021, are manufactured by Thor Industries, Inc., Winnebago Industries, Inc., and Forest River, Inc.
 
Pre-Owned Vehicles: Lazydays sells a comprehensive selection of pre-owned RVs at its dealership locations. The primary source of pre-owned RVs is through trade-ins associated with our RV sales. Lazydays is also very active in the pre-owned RV market, and its extensive RV knowledge and experience allows Lazydays to buy pre-owned RVs at attractive prices. Pre-owned RVs are generally reconditioned by the Company’s service operation prior to sale. Pre-owned RVs that do not meet the Company’s standards for retail sale are wholesaled.
 
Dealership Finance and Insurance
 
Vehicle financing: Lazydays arranges for financing for vehicle purchases through third-party financing providers in exchange for a commission. Lazydays does not directly finance its customers’ purchases, and its exposure to loss in connection with these financing arrangements is generally limited to the commissions it receives. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company arranged financing transactions for a majority of the new and pre-owned units sold.
 
Protection Plans: Lazydays offers a variety of third-party protection plans and services to the purchasers of its RVs as part of the delivery process, including extended vehicle service contracts, tire and wheel protection, guaranteed auto protection (known as “GAP”, this protection covers the shortfall between a customer’s loan balance and insurance payoff in the event of a casualty) and property insurance. These products are underwritten and administered by independent third parties. Lazydays is primarily compensated on a straight commission basis. The Company may be charged back (“charge-backs”) for financing fees, insurance or vehicle service contract commissions in the event of early termination of the contracts by the customers.
 
Parts and Services and Other
 
Repair and Maintenance: In addition to preparing RVs for delivery to customers, Lazydays service and repair operations, with nearly 500 service bays, provide onsite general RV maintenance and repair services at all of the Company’s dealership locations. Lazydays employs over 300 highly skilled technicians, many of them certified by the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (“RVIA”) or the National RV Dealers Association (“RVDA”). The Company is equipped to offer comprehensive services and perform OEM warranty repairs for most RV components.
 
Installation of Parts and Accessories: Lazydays full-service repair facilities enable Lazydays to install all parts and accessories sold at its dealership locations, including, among other items, towing and hitching products, satellite systems, braking systems, leveling systems and appliances. While other RV dealerships may be able to install RV parts and accessories and other retailers may be able to sell certain parts and accessories, Lazydays believes its ability to both sell and install necessary parts and accessories affords the Company a competitive advantage over online retailers and big box retailers that do not have service centers designed to accommodate RVs, and other RV dealerships that do not offer a comprehensive inventory of parts and accessories.
 
Collision Repair: Lazydays offers collision repair services in all markets and the Company’s Tampa and The Villages, Florida, Tucson, Arizona, Loveland, Colorado, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Minneapolis, Minnesota locations are equipped with full body paint booths. Lazydays facilities are equipped to offer a wide selection of collision repair services, including fiberglass front and rear cap replacement, windshield replacement, interior remodel solutions and paint work. The Company can perform collision repair services for a wide array of insurance carriers.
 
Parts and Accessories Store: With sizable parts and accessories inventory, in addition to onsite retail and accessory stores and access through the Lazydays networks for hard-to-find parts, Lazydays provides new and pre-owned RV buyers the option of dealer installed accessories, such as tow hitches, satellite dishes and specialized suspension systems that can be included in each buyer’s financing, or aftermarket through the Lazydays retail store footprint. The Company believes that its Tampa, Florida Accessories & More store is among the largest aftermarket parts and accessories stores in the state of Florida.

RV Campground: Lazydays also operates the Lazydays RV Resort at its Tampa, Florida location. Also known as the Lazydays RV Campground, the Lazydays RV Resort includes amenities designed to allow guests to relax, unwind, and enjoy fun activities as a family. The resort offers 300 RV sites with full 50-amp hookups, a full-time activities coordinator, sports courts, trolley service to and from the Lazydays dealership, and a screened and heated pool. The resort also operates on-site restaurants.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Grow the Company’s Customer Base. Lazydays believes its strong brands, market position, ongoing investment in its service platform, broad product portfolio and full array of RV offerings will continue to provide the Company with a competitive advantage in targeting and capturing a larger share of consumers, including the growing number of new RV enthusiasts that we believe are entering the market. The Company continuously works to attract new customers to its dealership locations through targeted integrated digital and traditional marketing efforts, attractive offerings, and access to its wide array of resources for RV enthusiasts. The Company has focused specifically on marketing to the fast-growing RV demographics of Baby Boomers, Gen X and Millennials. The Company also markets to these segments through RV lifestyle-focused partnership and sponsorship efforts.
 
Dealership Location Acquisitions. The RV dealership industry is highly fragmented with many independent RV dealers. The Company has used, and plans to continue to use, acquisitions of independent dealers as an alternative to Greenfield dealership location openings to expand its business and grow the Company’s customer base. Lazydays believes its experience and scale allow it to operate acquired locations efficiently. During 2021, Lazydays acquired Chilhowee Trailer Sales, Inc. located near Maryville, Tennessee; BYRV, Inc. and BYRV Washington, Inc. with locations in Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington; and Burlington RV Superstore, Inc. in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Lazydays intends to continue to pursue acquisitions that it expects will grow its customer base and present attractive value-creation opportunities and risk-adjusted returns.
 
Greenfield Dealership and Service Locations. Lazydays may establish dealership and/or service locations in new and existing markets to expand its customer base. Target markets and locations are identified by employing proprietary data and analytical tools. The Company believes there is ample white space for additional development opportunities. The Company intends to open greenfield sites that will grow its customer base and present attractive risk-adjusted returns and value-creation opportunities. The Company commenced development of a greenfield dealership near Nashville, Tennessee during 2019, which opened in January 2021, and opened its first dedicated service center in Waller, TX, a suburb northwest of Houston, in February 2020. The Company has also announced future greenfield start-up plans for Monticello, Minnesota (suburban Minneapolis); near Omaha, Nebraska; and Fort Pierce, Florida.
 
Service and Collision. Lazydays believes that its service and repair capabilities represent a significant opportunity for incremental revenue growth, especially as the Company grows geographically. Lazydays frequently welcomes customers who travel from across the country to have their vehicles serviced by its team of service and repair professionals. As a result, the service and repair department serves as a means of attracting potential customers to the Lazydays facilities and offers additional sales opportunities for Lazydays.
 
Parts and Accessories Store “Accessories & More”. Aftermarket RV parts and accessories are typically under-represented at RV dealerships. The Company believes that parts and accessories are an important part of the RV lifestyle, and serves to engage customers with the Lazydays brand outside of the typical RV buying and servicing cycle. The Company believes that RV owners need a reliable resource for RV necessities and products that make their camping experience more enjoyable. Lazydays stores have expansive offerings and provide access to RV product experts to assist RV owners in their RV lifestyle needs.

Leverage the Company’s scale and cost structure to improve operating efficiency. As Lazydays grows, it is positioned to leverage its scale to improve operating margins. The Company manages its new and pre-owned RV inventories so that its dealerships’ supply and assortment of vehicles are in line with seasonal sales trends and minimize the Company’s carrying costs. In addition, the Company leverages its scale to reduce costs related to purchasing certain equipment, supplies, and services through national vendor relationships.
 
Customers and Markets
 
The RV industry is characterized by RV enthusiasts’ investment in, and steadfast commitment to, the RV lifestyle. Approximately 11 million U.S. households are estimated to own an RV.
 
Owners invest in insurance, extended service contracts, parts and accessories, roadside assistance and regular maintenance to protect and maintain their RVs. They typically invest in new accessories and the necessary installation costs as they upgrade their RVs. They also spend on services and resources as they plan, engage in, and return from their road trips. Furthermore, based on industry research and management’s estimates, the Company believes that RV owners typically trade-in to buy another RV every four to five years.
 
Per the RV Industry Association’s (RVIA) December 2021 survey of manufacturers, total RV wholesale shipments ended 2021 at 600,240, up 39.5% compared to 430,412 units in 2020. Towable RVs were up 39.6% at 544,028 from 389,613 units and motorhome shipments were up 37.8% at 56,212 units from 40,799 units in 2020. Per the RVIA survey, 2021 ended with a record number of wholesale shipments. Generally, pre-owned RVs are sold at a lower price point than comparable new RVs and the sale of pre-owned RVs has historically been more stable than the sale of new vehicles through business cycles.
 
Lazydays believes RV trips remain one of the least expensive types of vacation, allowing RV owners to travel more while spending less. RV trips offer savings on a variety of vacation costs, including, among others, airfare, lodging, pet boarding and dining. While fuel costs are a component of the overall vacation cost, the Company believes fluctuations in fuel prices are not a significant factor affecting a family’s decision to take RV trips. Based on RVIA information, the average annual mileage use of an RV is between 3,000 and 5,000 miles. In addition, Lazydays customer research indicates that customers are attracted to RV ownership based on the comfortable and convenient travel it provides.
 
Competition
 
The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in the RV industry are breadth and depth of product selection, pricing, convenient dealership locations, quality technical services, customer service, and overall experience. The Company competes directly and/or indirectly with RV dealers, RV service providers, and RV parts and accessories retailers. One of the Company’s direct competitors, Camping World Holdings, Inc., is publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Additional competitors may enter the businesses in which the Company currently operates.
Lazydays RV Dealerships
 
The Company operates sixteen Lazydays dealership and service locations across ten states. The Company’s dealership and service locations are strategically located in key RV markets. Based on information collected by the Company from reports prepared by Statistical Surveys, these key RV markets of Florida, Colorado, Arizona, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas, Indiana, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin account for a significant portion of new RV units sold on an annual basis in the U.S. The Company’s dealerships in these key markets attract customers from all states, except Hawaii. Generally, the Company’s dealership locations provide RV repair and installation services, collision repair, parts, and accessories, and all of the Company’s dealership locations sell new and pre-owned RVs. The Company believes its dealership strategy of offering a comprehensive range of RV parts, services, accessories, products, and new and pre-owned RVs, generates powerful cross-selling opportunities.

Dealership Design and Layout
 
The Company’s operating dealership locations range in size from approximately 14,000 to 384,000 square feet and are situated on 11 to 126 acres. The Company’s dealership locations feature service centers staffed with expert, in-house trained product specialists and are equipped with merchandise demonstrations to assist in educating customers about RV performance products. The Company’s dealership locations also provide opportunities to promote a more interactive and consultative selling environment. The Lazydays staff is trained to cross-sell and explain the benefits of the Company’s breadth of available services, third party protection plans and products to which the Company’s customers have become accustomed, such as extended service contracts, emergency roadside assistance products, club memberships, discount camping and travel assistance.
 
The Company regularly refreshes its dealership locations to enhance the customers’ shopping experience and maximize product and service offerings. New products and services are introduced to capitalize on the advances of the RV industry and to satisfy needs of the Company’s customers. Store dress, promotional signage and directional signage are also periodically refreshed to further enhance the Lazydays customer shopping experience at Lazydays dealership locations.
 
Expansion Opportunities and Site Selection
 
The Company’s disciplined expansion and acquisition strategy focuses on growing its geographic footprint and customer base. The Company believes it has developed a rigorous and flexible process that employs exclusive data and analytical tools to identify target markets for acquisitions and new dealership and service center openings. The Company evaluates acquisition opportunities or selects sites for new locations based on criteria such as local demographics, traffic patterns, proximity to RV parks and campgrounds, proximity to major interstates, analytics from the Company’s customer database, RV sales and registrations, product availability and availability of attractive acquisition and/or lease terms. Members of the Lazydays development team spend considerable time evaluating markets and prospective sites.
Dealership Management and Training
 
The Company’s Vice President, National General Manager oversees all dealership operations. He has more than 41 years of experience in the RV industry and has been employed by Lazydays for over 8 years.
 
Every dealership location is overseen by a General Manager (the “GM”) that has responsibility for the daily operations of the dealership. Areas of responsibility include sales and service management, inventory management, hiring, associate training and development, maintenance of the facilities, and customer service and satisfaction. A GM’s management team includes a sales manager, a parts and accessories manager, a service manager, and a finance and insurance manager who help oversee the operations of each dealership location department. A typical Lazydays dealership location employs approximately 30 to 100 full-time equivalent employees.
 
The Company employs a Vice President, Operations and Supply Chain, and a centralized inventory management team to oversee and manage the Company’s RV inventory and provide consistency and controls in the forecasting, ordering, purchasing and distribution of RV inventory.
 
The Company employs a Vice President of Service who has responsibility for the service operations of the dealership locations. His responsibilities include ensuring the efficiency, logistics, and scheduling of service operations to deliver a premium customer experience.
 
The Company is constantly seeking to add top talent through a robust talent acquisition process and by partnering with local trade schools and community organizations. The interview and selection process identifies current and future candidates with the goal of hiring talented people that are customer focused and align with our core values. The Company has incorporated candidate assessment tools and technology to help it with its talent acquisition and development processes.
 
The Company has made a significant investment in developing comprehensive Tech and Sales training programs. In addition, we have incorporated a robust skills assessment and corporate training curriculum to help identify and grow our key talent and ultimately prepare them for a successful career in our growing business. Training is continuous throughout employment by the Company via scheduled e-learning modules, in-person workshops and knowledge checks.

Product Sourcing
 
New and Pre-owned RVs
 
The Company generally acquires new RVs for retail sale directly from the applicable manufacturer. Lazydays has strategic contractual arrangements with many of the leading RV manufacturers. Lazydays maintains a central inventory management and purchasing group to manage and maintain adequate inventory levels and assortment. RVs are transported directly from a manufacturer’s facility to Lazydays dealership locations via various third-party transportation companies.
 
Lazydays strategy is to partner with financially sound manufacturers that make quality products, have adequate manufacturing capacity and distribution, and maintain an appropriate product mix.
 
Lazydays supply arrangements with OEMs are typically governed by dealer agreements, which are customary in the RV industry. The Company’s dealer agreements with OEMs are generally made on a location-by-location basis. These dealer agreements generally designate a specific geographic territory, exclusive to Lazydays, provided that Lazydays meets the material obligations of the dealer agreement. The terms of these dealer agreements are typically subject to Lazydays, among other things, meeting all the requirements and conditions of the dealer agreement, maintaining certain sales objectives, performing services and repairs for owners of the manufacturer’s RVs that are still under manufacturer warranty, carrying in stock at all times the manufacturer’s parts and accessories needed to service and repair the manufacturer’s RVs, actively advertising and promoting the manufacturer’s RVs and indemnifying the manufacturer under certain circumstances. Wholesale pricing is generally established on a model year basis and is subject to change at the manufacturer’s sole discretion. In certain cases, the manufacturer may also establish a suggested retail price, below which the Company cannot advertise that manufacturer’s RVs for some specified period.
 
Lazydays generally acquires pre-owned RVs from customers, primarily through trade-ins, as well as through private sales, auctions, and other sources, and the Company generally reconditions pre-owned RVs acquired for retail sale in its service operation. Pre-owned RVs that Lazydays has determined are not suited for sale at a Lazydays dealership location generally are sold at wholesale prices through auctions.
 
Lazydays finances the purchase of substantially all of the Company’s new RV inventory from OEMs through a floor plan facility. Pre-owned vehicles may also be financed from time to time through the floor plan facility. For more information on the floor plan facility, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — M&T Credit Facility” below.
 
Parts and Accessories
 
The purchasing activities for the Company’s parts and accessories departments are focused on RV maintenance products, outdoor lifestyle products, RV parts and accessories, such as, among other things, generators and electrical supplies, satellite receivers and GPS systems, towing and hitching products, RV appliances, and essential supplies and other products and services necessary or desirable for the RV lifestyle. The Company maintains central purchasing functions to manage inventory, product-planning, allocate merchandise to the Company’s dealership locations and oversee the replenishment of basic merchandise. The Company has no long-term purchase commitments. The Company leverages its scale to reduce costs related to purchasing certain equipment, supplies, and services through long-standing, continuous relationships with its largest vendors.
Marketing and Advertising
 
The Company markets its product offerings through integrated marketing campaigns across all digital and traditional marketing disciplines, with an emphasis on digital. The Company’s marketing efforts include its website, paid and organic search efforts, email, social media, online blog and video content, television, radio, billboards, direct mail, and RV shows and rallies. Lazydays also has exclusive partnership and sponsorship relationships with various RV lifestyle properties. The Company currently has a segmented marketing database of over 2.2 million RV owners and prospects. Lazydays principal marketing strategy is to leverage its unique brand positioning, extensive product selection, exclusive benefits, and high quality customer experience among RV owners. As per a research report prepared by Russell Research in November / December 2017, over 70% of Lazydays customers and over 60% of prospective customers surveyed strongly agree that Lazydays provides a high quality customer experience.

The Lazydays website features over 4,000 new and pre-owned RVs, as well as information regarding Lazydays RV financing and insurance products, service capabilities, parts and accessories offerings, and other RV lifestyle content.
 
The Company measures its marketing productivity and effectiveness on an ongoing basis to optimize marketing efforts.

Insurance Laws and Regulations
 
As a marketer of insurance programs, the Company is subject to state rules and regulations governing the business of insurance including, without limitation, laws governing the administration, underwriting, marketing, solicitation and/or sale of insurance programs. The insurance carriers that underwrite the programs that the Company sells are required to file their rates for approval by state regulators.

Marketing Laws and Regulations
 
The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and each of the states have enacted consumer protection statutes designed to ensure that consumers are protected from unfair and deceptive marketing practices. Lazydays reviews all of its marketing materials for compliance with applicable FTC regulations and state marketing laws.
Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
 
The Company’s operations involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling and/or disposal of materials such as motor oil and filters, transmission fluids, antifreeze, refrigerants, paints, thinners, batteries, cleaning products, lubricants, degreasing agents, tires and propane. Consequently, the Company’s business is subject to a variety of federal, state and local requirements that regulate the environment and public health and safety.
 
Most of the Lazydays dealership locations utilize aboveground storage tanks, and to a lesser extent underground storage tanks, primarily for petroleum-based products. Storage tanks are subject to periodic testing, containment, upgrading and removal requirements under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and its state law counterparts. Clean-up or other remedial action may be necessary in the event of leaks or other discharges from storage tanks or other sources. In addition, water quality protection programs under the federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act), the Safe Drinking Water Act and comparable state and local programs govern certain discharges from some of the Company’s operations.

Insurance

Beginning in 2020, the Company became self-insured for employee health-care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering actuarial reports, historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, stop loss coverage and other assumptions. The Company’s results could be adversely affected by claims and other expenses related to such plans and policies if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.

Seasonality and Effects of Weather
 
The Company’s operations generally experience modestly higher volumes of vehicle sales in the first half of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the hospitable warm climate during the winter months at our Florida and Arizona locations. In addition, the northern locations in Colorado, Tennessee, Minnesota, Indiana, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin generally experience modestly higher vehicle sales during the spring months.
 
The Company’s largest RV dealership is located near Tampa, Florida, which is in close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico. A severe weather event, such as a hurricane, could cause severe damage to property and inventory and decrease the traffic to our dealerships. Although the Company believes that it has adequate insurance coverage, if the Company were to experience a catastrophic loss, the Company may exceed its policy limits, and/or may have difficulty obtaining similar insurance coverage in the future.
