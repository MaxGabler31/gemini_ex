Item 1. Business
Overview
    Varex Imaging Corporation is a leading innovator, designer and manufacturer of X-ray components including tubes, digital detectors, linear accelerators, image software processing solutions and stand-alone x-ray based systems in select application areas. Our components are used in medical diagnostic imaging, security inspection systems, and industrial quality inspection systems, as well as for analysis and measurement applications in industrial manufacturing applications. Global OEMs incorporate our X-ray imaging components in their systems to detect, diagnose, protect, irradiate and inspect. Varex has approximately 2,300 full-time employees located at engineering, manufacturing and service center sites in North America, Europe, and Asia.
    Our products are sold in three geographic regions: the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. The Americas includes North America (primarily the United States) and Latin America. EMEA includes Europe, Russia, the Middle East, India and Africa. APAC includes Asia (other than India) and Australia. Revenues by region are based on the known final destination of products sold.
    Our success depends, among other things, on our ability to anticipate and respond to changes in our markets, the direction of technological innovation and the demand from our customers. We continually invest in research and development and employ approximately 300 individuals in product development related activities. Our focus on innovation and product performance along with strong and long-term customer relationships allows us to collaborate with our customers to bring industry-leading products to the X-ray imaging market. We continue to work to improve the life and quality of our imaging components and leverage our scale as one of the largest independent X-ray imaging component suppliers to provide cost-effective solutions for our customers.
Operating Segments and Products
    We have two reportable operating segments: Medical and Industrial. The segments align our products and service offerings with customer use in medical and industrial markets. 
Medical
    In our Medical segment, we design, manufacture, sell and service X-ray imaging components, including X-ray tubes, digital detectors, high voltage connectors, image-processing software and workstations, 3D reconstruction software, computer-aided diagnostic software, collimators, automatic exposure control devices, generators, and heat exchangers. These components are used in a range of medical imaging applications including CT, mammography, oncology, cardiac, surgery, dental, and other diagnostic radiography uses.
    Our X-ray imaging components are primarily sold to OEM customers. These OEM customers then design-in our products into their X-ray imaging systems for a variety of medical modalities. A substantial majority of medical X-ray imaging OEMs globally are our customers, and many of these have been our customers for over 25 years. We believe one of the reasons for customer loyalty is that our hardware and software products are tightly integrated with our customers' systems. We work very closely with our customers to create custom built components for their systems based on technology platforms that we have developed. Because our products are often customized for our customers' specific equipment, it can be costly and complex for our customers to switch to another provider. Once our components are designed into our customers' equipment, our customers will typically continue to buy from us for any replacement components and for service and support for that equipment. Some of our products are also included in product 
registrations for our customers' equipment that require regulatory approval to change. In addition to sales to OEM customers, we sell our products to independent service companies and distributors as well as directly to end-users for replacement purposes.
    We are one of the largest global manufacturers of X-ray imaging components and each year we produce over 28,000 X-ray tubes and 20,000 X-ray detectors. We estimate that our world-wide installed base of products includes more than 160,000 X-ray tubes, 170,000 X-ray detectors, 600,000 connect and control components and 16,000 software instances. Replacement and service of our existing installed base makes up a significant portion of our revenue. Many of our components need to be replaced regularly depending upon usage and other factors. For example, CT X-ray tubes generally need to be replaced every 2 to 6 years. In China, the replacement cycle for CT X-ray tubes currently can be as frequent as every 10 to 20 months due to high utilization of imaging equipment. Other products such as X-ray detectors have a useful life of as much as 7 years or more, but can require more frequent service and repairs during their useful life. In addition, our detector customers often elect to upgrade products to newer technology before the end of a current product’s useful life. X-ray imaging software is a relatively small part of our business and includes maintenance revenue for software licenses.
    The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on hospitals, clinics and outpatient imaging centers as they encountered declines in elective procedures volume. As a result, they reduced the capital purchases of imaging equipment from OEMs, which led to lower demand for X-ray imaging components for us. Additionally, equipment installations were delayed, due to reduced access to healthcare institutions. Partially offsetting this was an increased demand for imaging equipment used to diagnose respiratory diseases, such as radiographic X-ray imaging systems and CT imaging systems. The Company has experienced growth in demand for its products as health systems globally have continued to address healthcare services gaps. However, the Company has not been able to convert all the demand into sales due to on-going supply chain related interruptions and uncertainties, particularly with the availability of micro-controller chips and other electronic components. As a result, uncertainty in overall sales volume is expected to continue at least through the fiscal year 2023.
    In China, the government is broadening the availability of healthcare services. As a result, the number of diagnostic X-ray imaging systems, including CT, has grown significantly. We are developing CT X-ray tubes and related subsystems for Chinese OEMs as they introduce new systems in China. Over the long-term, our objective is to become the partner of choice both for OEMs and in the replacement market as CT systems become more widely adopted throughout the Chinese market.
    In recent years our business in China has been impacted by the trade war with the United States in three principal ways: (1) importing raw materials from China to the United States has become more expensive, (2) importing raw materials and sub-assemblies from the United States to China has become more expensive, and (3) importing finished U.S. manufactured products into China has become more difficult and expensive. While the governments of both the United States and China have granted tariff exclusions that temporarily eliminate the additional duties payable for specific commodities, providing partial relief, these exclusions are temporary and/or must be solicited and approved on a shipment-by-shipment basis. There is no guarantee that such exclusions will be granted or extended by either government. In order to mitigate the impact of tariffs on materials imported from China, we have implemented changes to secure more non-China sources of materials used to manufacture our X-ray imaging products. To help mitigate the impact of tariffs on materials imported to China, and to be closer to our global customer base, we continue to expand manufacturing capabilities at our facilities in China, Germany, the Netherlands and the Philippines. We have also implemented local sourcing strategies to offer local content. This local-for-local strategy has been well received by both our local customers as well as global OEMs, and acts as a natural hedge against trade wars and other potential supply chain disruptions.
Industrial
    In our Industrial segment, we design, develop, manufacture, sell and service X-ray imaging products for use in a number of markets, including security applications for cargo screening at ports and borders and baggage screening at airports, and nondestructive testing, irradiation and inspection applications used in a number of other vertical markets. Our industrial products include Linatron® X-ray linear accelerators, X-ray tubes, digital detectors and high voltage connectors. In addition, we license proprietary image-processing and detection software designed to work with other Varex products to provide packaged sub-assembly solutions to our industrial customers. Our Industrial business benefits from the research and development investment and manufacturing economies of scale on the Medical side of our business, as we continue to find new applications for our technology. Along with more favorable pricing dynamics, this allows us to generally achieve higher gross profit for industrial products relative to our Medical business. In addition, our Industrial business benefits from our long-term service agreements for our Linatron® products.
    The security market primarily consists of cargo security for the screening of trucks, trains, and cargo containers at ports and borders as well as airport security for carry-on baggage, checked baggage and palletized cargo. The end customers for border protection systems are typically government agencies, many of which are in oil-based economies and war zones where there can be significant variation in buying patterns.
    Non-destructive testing and inspection verticals utilize X-ray imaging to scan items for inspection of manufacturing defects and product integrity in a wide range of industries including the aerospace, automotive, electronics, oil and gas, food packaging, metal castings and 3D printing industries. In addition, new applications for X-ray sources are being developed, such as sterilization of food and its packaging. We provide X-ray sources, digital detectors, high voltage connectors and image processing software to OEM customers, system integrators and manufacturers in a variety of these verticals. We believe that the non-destructive testing market represents a significant growth opportunity for our business, and we are actively pursuing new potential applications for our products.
    The economic downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the demand for X-ray imaging equipment utilized in the non-destructive testing market as manufacturers focused on cash preservation and reduced spending for capital equipment. However, we have seen improved conditions in this market, which continued during the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.
Customers
    Our customers are primarily large OEMs. Our top five customers, measured by revenue, are Canon Medical Systems Corporation (“Canon”), United Imaging Healthcare, General Electric Company, Siemens Healthineers AG, and Elekta AB, which collectively accounted for approximately 40% of total revenue in fiscal year 2022. Our largest customer, Canon, accounted for approximately 17%, 18% and 21% of our total revenue for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, while our ten largest customers as a group accounted for approximately 52%, 51% and 52% of our revenue for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Competition
    The imaging components market is highly competitive. OEMs may choose to develop and manufacture X-ray imaging components in-house or they may choose to out-source to a supplier such as Varex or our competitors. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate changes in our markets, the direction of technological innovation and the demand from our customers. To remain competitive, we must continually invest in research and development focused on innovation, improve product performance and quality, and continue to reduce the cost of our imaging components. Significant capital investment is required to manufacture imaging components. We believe we have sufficient manufacturing scale to leverage our high volume to reduce overall costs by spreading fixed costs over more units.
Medical
    We often compete with the in-house X-ray tube manufacturing operations of major diagnostic imaging systems companies, which are the primary OEM customers for our Medical products. To effectively compete with these in-house capabilities, we must have a competitive advantage in one or more significant areas, such as innovative technology and greater product performance, better product quality, better product availability or lower product price. We sell a significant volume of our X-ray tubes to OEM customers that have in-house X-ray tube production capability. In addition, we compete with some OEM customers, such as Canon, Philips Healthcare and other companies who sell X-ray tubes to smaller OEMs and other manufacturers, such as Industria Applicazioni Elettroniche S.p.A, as well as emerging X-ray tube manufacturers in China. High capital costs and mastery of complex manufacturing processes that drive production yield and product life are significant characteristics of the X-ray tube business.
    The market for digital detectors is highly competitive. We sell our digital detectors to a number of OEM customers that incorporate our detectors into their medical diagnostic, oncology, 3D dental and veterinary imaging systems. Our amorphous silicon based digital detector technology, our photon counting technology and our complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology compete with other detector technologies, such as amorphous selenium, charge-coupled devices and variations of amorphous silicon scintillators. We believe that our products provide a competitive advantage due to product quality and performance and lower total cost of ownership over the product lifecycle. In the digital flat panel detector market, we primarily compete against Trixell S.A.S., Canon, Vieworks Co., Ltd., Hamamatsu Corporation, iRay Technology (Shanghai) Limited and Jiangsu CareRay Medical Systems Co., Ltd.
Industrial
    In the low-energy market of the Industrial segment, we compete with other OEM suppliers, such as iRay, Teledyne and Comet AG. While there are other manufacturers of low-energy X-ray tubes and digital detectors for specialized and niche industrial applications, our products are designed for a broad range of applications in inspection, analysis, and non-destructive testing. In the high-energy market, we compete against technologies from Nuctech Company Limited, Siemens AG, ETM Electromatic Inc., and PMB Alcen, whose X-ray sources are used in applications that include cargo and container scanning, border security, aerospace applications, castings and pressure vessel inspections.
Customer Services and Support
    We generally warrant our products for 12 to 24 months. In certain cases, the warranty is specified by usage metrics such as number of scans. We provide technical advice and consultation to major OEM customers from our U.S. offices in Utah, California, Nevada, New York and Illinois; and internationally in the Philippines, China, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, the United Kingdom, Italy and Japan. Our application specialists and engineers make recommendations to meet the customer’s technical requirements within the customer’s budgetary constraints. We often develop specifications for a unique product that will be designed and manufactured to meet a specific customer’s requirements.
Manufacturing and Supplies
    We manufacture our products at facilities in Salt Lake City, Utah; Las Vegas, Nevada; Liverpool, New York; Franklin Park, Illinois; Doetinchem, the Netherlands; Walluf and Bremen, Germany; Espoo, Finland; Calamba City, Philippines; and Wuxi, China. These facilities employ state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques and several have been recognized by the press, governments and trade organizations for their commitment to quality improvement. Each of these manufacturing facilities are certified by the International Standards Organization (“ISO”) under ISO 9001 (for industrial products) or ISO 13485 (for medical devices). In addition, we have a regional service center in Willich, Germany. The combined medical and industrial manufacturing infrastructure enables us to leverage production scale to achieve productivity and low cost advantage as well as research and development synergies.
    Manufacturing processes at our various facilities include machining, fabrication, subassembly, system assembly and final testing. We have invested in various automated and semi-automated equipment for the fabrication and machining of the parts and assemblies that we incorporate into our products. We may, from time to time, invest further in such equipment. Our quality assurance program includes various quality control measures from inspection of raw materials, purchased parts and assemblies through in-line inspection. In some cases, we outsource the manufacturing of sub-assemblies while still performing system design, final assembly and testing in-house. In such cases, we believe outsourcing enables us to reduce or maintain fixed costs and capital expenditures, while also providing the flexibility to increase production capacity. We purchase material and components from various suppliers that are either standard products or customized to our specifications. Some of the components included in our products may be sourced from a limited group of suppliers or from a single source supplier, such as the wave guides for linear accelerators; transistor arrays and cesium iodide coatings for digital detectors and specialized integrated circuits, X-ray tube targets, housings, bearings and various other components. We require certain raw materials, such as copper, nickel, silver, gold, lead, tungsten, iridium, rhenium, molybdenum, rhodium, niobium, zirconium, and various high grades of steel alloy for X-ray tubes and industrial products. Worldwide demand, availability and pricing of these raw materials have been volatile, and we expect that availability and pricing will continue to fluctuate in the future.
Research and Development
    Innovation and developing products, systems and services based on advanced technology is essential to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace. We maintain a research and development and engineering staff responsible for product design and engineering.
    Research and development are primarily conducted domestically at our facilities in Salt Lake City, Utah; San Jose, California; Las Vegas, Nevada; Liverpool, New York; and Franklin Park, Illinois and internationally at our facilities in the Netherlands, UK, Sweden, Finland and Germany. Our research and development activities are primarily focused on developing and improving imaging component technology. Current X-ray source development areas include smaller footprint linear accelerators, improvements to tube life and tube stability, reductions of tube noise and tube designs that will enable OEMs to continue to reduce dose delivered, and improve image resolution, cost effectively. Research in digital detector imaging technology is aimed at developing new panel technologies (such as photon counting) with better dose utilization, improved image quality and materials discrimination, lower product costs and new image processing tools for advanced applications.
    Industrial products share some of the same base technology competencies and platforms as medical products and our medical and industrial development teams are therefore co-located in Salt Lake City, Utah; San Jose, California; Doetinchem, Netherlands; Danderyd, Sweden; Espoo, Finland and Walluf, Germany. One of our competitive advantages is that some of the foundational technologies and software components developed for medical applications may also be applicable in industrial components, and vice versa. In addition to these product development synergies, we are also able to realize sourcing, production, service center, and logistics synergies across the different products and market sectors.
Product and Other Liabilities
    Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacture, sale, installation, servicing and support of X-ray imaging devices, related software and other devices that contain hazardous material or deliver radiation. Because our products are involved in the intentional delivery of radiation to the human body and other situations where people may come in contact with radiation (for example, when our Industrial products are being used to scan cargo) as well as the detection, planning and treatment of medical problems, the possibility for significant injury or death exists if our products fail to work or are not used properly. We may face substantial liability to patients, our customers and others for damages resulting from the faulty, or allegedly faulty, design, manufacture, installation, servicing, support, testing or interoperability of our products and our customers’ products, or their misuse or failure. We may also be subject to claims for property damages or economic loss related to or resulting from any errors or defects in our products, or the installation, servicing and support of our products. Any accident or mistreatment could subject us to legal costs, litigation, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, whether or not our products or services were a factor. In addition, if a product we design or manufacture were defective (whether due to design, labeling or manufacturing defects, improper use of the product or other reasons), or found to be so by a regulatory authority, we may be required to correct or recall the product and notify other regulatory authorities. We maintain limited product liability, professional liability and omissions liability insurance coverage.
Government Regulation
U.S. Regulations
    Laws governing marketing a medical device. In the United States, as a manufacturer and seller of medical devices and devices emitting radiation or utilizing radioactive by-product material, we and some of our suppliers and distributors are subject to extensive regulation by federal governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”), and state and local regulatory agencies, to ensure the devices are safe and effective and comply with laws governing products that emit, produce or control radiation. Similar international regulations apply overseas. These regulations, which include the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”) and regulations promulgated by the FDA, govern, among other things, the design, development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, import/export, sale and marketing and disposal of medical devices, post market surveillance and reporting of serious injuries and death, repairs, replacements, recalls and other matters relating to medical devices, radiation emitting devices and devices utilizing radioactive by-product material. State regulations are extensive and vary from state to state. Our X-ray tube products, imaging workstations and flat panel detectors are considered medical devices. Under the FDC Act, each medical device manufacturer must comply with quality system regulations that are strictly enforced by the FDA.
    Unless an exception applies, the FDA requires that the manufacturer of a new medical device or a new indication for use of, or other significant change in, an existing currently marketed medical device obtain 510(k) pre-market notification clearance before it can market or sell those products in the United States. The 510(k) clearance process is applicable when the device introduced into commercial distribution is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device. Obtaining the 510(k) clearance generally takes at least six months from the date an application is filed, but could take significantly longer, and generally requires submitting supporting testing data. After a product receives 510(k) clearance, any modifications or enhancements to a product that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, technology, materials, labeling, packaging, or manufacturing process, may require a new 510(k) clearance. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with the manufacturer’s decision, it may retroactively require the manufacturer to submit a request for 510(k) pre-market notification clearance and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the product until 510(k) clearance is obtained. The FDA adopted guidance in September 2019 that we expect will increase the number and frequency of clearances for changes made to legally marketed devices. Most of our products are non-classified or Class I medical devices, which do not require 510(k) clearance.
    Quality systems. Our manufacturing operations for medical devices, and those of our third-party manufacturers, are required to comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which addresses a company’s responsibility for product design, testing, and manufacturing quality assurance, and the maintenance of records and documentation. The QSR requires that each manufacturer establish a quality systems program by which the manufacturer monitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with FDA regulations and the manufacturer’s written specifications and procedures relating to the devices. QSR compliance is necessary to receive and maintain FDA clearance or approval to market new and existing products. The FDA makes announced and unannounced periodic and ongoing inspections of medical device manufacturers to determine compliance with the QSR. If in connection with these inspections the FDA believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures, it may issue observations that would necessitate prompt corrective action. If FDA inspection observations are not addressed and/or corrective action is not taken in a timely manner and to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue a warning letter (which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action) and/or proceed directly to other forms of 
enforcement action. Failure to respond timely to FDA inspection observations, a warning letter or other notice of noncompliance and to promptly come into compliance could result in the FDA bringing enforcement action against us, which could include the total shutdown of our production facilities, denial of importation rights to the United States for products manufactured in overseas locations and denial of export rights for U.S. products and criminal and civil fines.
    The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) regulate advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that we have adequate and reasonable scientific data to substantiate the claims and that our promotional labeling and advertising is neither false nor misleading. We may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or approvals or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims.
    It is also important that our products comply with electrical safety and environmental standards, such as those of Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”), the Canadian Standards Association (“CSA”), and the International Electrotechnical Commission (“IEC”). In addition, the manufacture and distribution of medical devices utilizing radioactive material requires a specific radioactive material license. For the United States, manufacture and distribution of these radioactive sources and devices also must be in accordance with a model-specific certificate issued by either the NRC or by an Agreement State. In essentially every country and state, installation and service of these products must be in accordance with a specific radioactive materials license issued by the applicable radiation control agency. Service of these products must be in accordance with a specific radioactive materials license. We are also subject to a variety of additional environmental laws regulating our manufacturing operations and the handling, storage, transport and disposal of hazardous substances, and which impose liability for the cleanup of any contamination from these substances.
    Other applicable U.S. regulations. As a participant in the healthcare industry, we are also subject to extensive laws and regulations protecting the privacy and integrity of patient medical information that we receive, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), new state privacy laws, “fraud and abuse” laws and regulations, including physician self-referral prohibitions, and false claims laws. From time to time, these laws and regulations may be revised or interpreted in ways that could make it more difficult for our customers to conduct their businesses, such as recent proposed revisions to the laws prohibiting physician self-referrals, and such revisions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products, and therefore our business and results of operations. We also must comply with numerous federal, state and local laws of more general applicability relating to such matters as environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, fire hazard control and other matters.
    The laws and regulations and their enforcement are constantly undergoing change, and we cannot predict what effect, if any, changes to these laws and regulations may have on our business. For example, national and state laws regulate privacy and may regulate our use of data. Furthermore, HIPAA was amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act to provide that business associates who have access to patient health information provided by hospitals and healthcare providers are now directly subject to HIPAA, including the associated enforcement scheme and inspection requirements.
Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement
    The federal and state governments of the United States establish guidelines and pay reimbursements to hospitals and free-standing clinics for diagnostic examinations and therapeutic procedures under Medicare at the federal level and Medicaid at the state level. Private insurers often establish payment levels and policies based on reimbursement rates and guidelines established by the government.
    The federal government and Congress review and adjust rates annually, and from time to time consider various Medicare and other healthcare reform proposals that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for healthcare services in hospitals and free-standing clinics. In the past, we have seen demand for our customers’ systems (in which our products are incorporated) negatively impacted by the uncertainties surrounding reimbursement rates in the United States. State government reimbursement for services is determined pursuant to each state’s Medicaid plan, which is established by state law and regulations, subject to requirements of federal law and regulations.
    Various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level, and we are unable to predict which, if any, of these proposals will be enacted. In addition, it is possible that changes in federal health care law and policy could result in additional proposals and/or changes to health care system legislation which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Uncertainty created by healthcare reform complicates our customers’ decision-making process and, therefore, may impact our business.
    The sale of medical devices, the referral of patients for diagnostic examinations and treatments utilizing such devices, and the submission of claims to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) seeking reimbursement for such services, are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse.” Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, induce, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of business, including the purchase of medical devices from a particular manufacturer or the referral of patients to a particular supplier of diagnostic services utilizing such devices. False claims laws prohibit 
anyone from knowingly and willfully presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent, for services not provided as claimed, or for medically unnecessary services. The Office of the Inspector General prosecutes violations of fraud and abuse laws and any violation may result in criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, which may negatively impact the demand for our products.
Foreign Regulations
    Our operations, sales and service of our products outside the United States are subject to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country and may differ significantly from those in the United States. In general, our products are regulated outside the United States as medical devices by foreign governmental agencies similar to the FDA.
    Marketing a medical device internationally. For us to market our products internationally, we must obtain clearances or approvals for products and product modifications. We are required to affix the CE mark to our products to sell them in member countries of the European Union (“EU”). The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain essential principles of safety and effectiveness, which once affixed enables a product to be sold in member countries of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). The CE mark is also recognized in many countries outside the EU and can assist in the clearance process. To receive permission to affix the CE mark to our medical device products, we must obtain approvals and Quality System certification, e.g., ISO 13485, through an accredited Notified Body and must otherwise have a quality management system that complies with the EU Medical Device Directive, which was superseded by the EU MDR-Medical Device Regulations in May 2021. The ISO promulgates standards for certification of quality assurance operations. We are certified as complying with the ISO 9001 for our security and inspection products and ISO 13485 for our medical devices. Several Asian countries, including Japan and China, have adopted regulatory schemes that are comparable, and in some cases more stringent, than the EU scheme. To import medical devices into Japan, the requirements of the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Act must be met and an approval to sell medical products in Japan, must be obtained. Similarly, a registration certification issued by the National Medical Products Administration and a China Compulsory Certification mark for certain products are required to sell medical devices in China. Obtaining such certifications on our products can be time-consuming and can cause us to delay marketing or sales of certain products in such countries. Similarly, prior to selling a device in Canada, manufacturers of Class II devices must obtain a medical device license from Health Canada. Additionally, many countries have laws and regulations relating to radiation and radiation safety that apply to our products. In most countries, radiological regulatory agencies require some form of licensing or registration by the facility prior to acquisition and operation of an X-ray generating device or a radiation source. The handling, transportation and recycling of radioactive metals and source materials are also highly regulated.
    A number of countries, including the members of the EU, have implemented or are implementing regulations that would require manufacturers to dispose, or bear certain disposal costs, of products at the end of a product’s useful life and restrict the use of some hazardous substances in certain products sold in those countries. While these regulations could impose a future cost on the Company, compliance programs are in place to anticipate or establish best estimates of what the potential exposure of such costs could be should they arise.
    Manufacturing and selling a device internationally. We are subject to laws and regulations outside the United States applicable to manufacturers of radiation-producing devices and products utilizing radioactive materials, and laws and regulations of general applicability relating to matters such as environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices and other matters, in each case that are often comparable to, if not more stringent than, regulations in the United States. In addition, our sales of products in foreign countries are subject to regulation of matters such as product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, environmental and product recycling requirements, tariff regulations, and duties and tax requirements. In some countries, we rely on our foreign distributors and agents to assist us in complying with foreign regulatory requirements.
    Other applicable international regulations. In addition to the U.S. laws regarding the privacy and integrity of patient medical information, we are subject to similar or stricter laws and regulations in foreign countries covering data privacy and other protection of health and employee information. Particularly within Europe, data protection legislation is comprehensive and complex and there has been a recent trend toward more stringent enforcement of requirements regarding protection and confidentiality of personal data, as well as enactment of stricter legislation. We are also subject to international “fraud and abuse” laws and regulations, as well as false claims and misleading advertisement laws. We also must comply with numerous international laws of more general applicability relating to such matters as environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, fire hazard control and other matters.
Anti-Corruption Laws and Regulations
    We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-corruption laws, and similar laws in foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and the law “On the Fundamentals of Health Protection in the Russian Federation”. In general, there 
is a worldwide trend to strengthen anti-corruption laws and their enforcement, and the healthcare industry and medical equipment manufacturers have been particular targets of these investigation and enforcement efforts. Any violation of these laws by us or our agents or distributors could create substantial liability for us, subject our officers and directors to personal liability and also cause a loss of reputation in the market.
    Transparency International’s 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index measured the degree to which public sector corruption is perceived to exist in 180 countries/territories around the world and found that two-thirds of the countries in the index, including many that we consider to be high-growth areas for our products, such as China and India, scored below 50, on a scale from 100 (very clean) to 0 (highly corrupt). We currently operate in many countries where the public sector is perceived as being more or highly corrupt and our strategic business plans include expanding our business in regions and countries that are rated as higher risk for corruption activity by Transparency International.
    Increased business in higher-risk countries could subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability. In addition, becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to comply with laws, rules and regulations applicable to new business activities and mitigating and protecting against corruption risks could be quite costly. Failure by us or our agents or distributors to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could delay our expansion into high-growth markets and could materially and adversely affect our business.
Competition and Trade Compliance Laws
    We are subject to various competition and trade compliance laws in the jurisdictions where we operate. Regulatory or government authorities where we operate may have enforcement powers that can subject us to sanctions and can impose changes or conditions in the way we conduct our business. For example, local authorities may disagree with how we classify our products, and we may be required to change our classifications, which could increase our operating costs or subject us to increased taxes or fines and penalties. In addition, an increasing number of jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to seek damages asserting claims of anti-competitive conduct. Increased government scrutiny of our actions or enforcement or private rights of action could materially and adversely affect our business or damage our reputation. In addition, we may conduct, or we may be required to conduct, internal investigations or face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government or regulatory agencies, which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to increased costs, fines or criminal or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results. Furthermore, competition laws may prohibit or increase the cost of future acquisitions that we may desire to undertake.
    International sales of certain of our Linatron® X-ray accelerators are subject to U.S. export licenses that are issued at the discretion of the U.S. government. Orders and revenues for our security and inspection products have been and may continue to be unpredictable as governmental agencies may place large orders with us or with our customers over a short period of time and then may not place additional orders until complete deployment and installation of previously ordered products. Furthermore, tender awards in this business may be subject to challenge by third parties, as we have previously encountered, which can make the conversion of orders to revenues unpredictable for some security and inspection products. The market for border protection systems has slowed significantly and end customers, particularly in oil-based economies and war zones in which we have a significant customer base, are delaying system deployments or tenders and have considered moving to alternative sources.
Intellectual Property
    We place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent, copyright and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes, because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and to the marketplace.
    We generally rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret and other laws, and contractual restrictions on disclosure, copying and transferring title, including confidentiality agreements with vendors, strategic partners, co-developers, employees, consultants and other third parties, to protect our proprietary rights in the developments, improvements and inventions that we have originated and which are incorporated in our products or that fall within our fields of interest. As of September 30, 2022, we own approximately 260 patents issued in the United States, approximately 400 patents issued throughout the rest of the world and have approximately 130 patent applications pending with various patent agencies worldwide. The patents issued or issuing from the pending applications generally expire between 2022 and 2040. We intend to file additional patent applications as appropriate. We have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that are maintained and enforced to provide customer recognition for our products in the marketplace. We also have agreements with third parties that provide for licensing of patented or proprietary technology, including royalty-bearing licenses and technology cross-licenses. These licenses generally can only be terminated for breach. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to our Intellectual Property and Information Systems.”
    In conjunction with the January 2017 separation from Varian Medical Systems, Inc. ("Varian"), we entered into an Intellectual Property Matters Agreement with Varian, pursuant to which, among other things, we each granted the other licenses to use certain intellectual property. Varian was subsequently acquired by Siemens in April of 2021.
Environmental Matters
    Our operations and facilities, past and present, are subject to environmental laws, including laws that regulate the handling, storage, transport and disposal of hazardous substances. Certain of those laws impose cleanup liabilities under certain circumstances. In connection with those laws and certain of our past and present operations and facilities, we are obligated to indemnify Varian for 20% of the cleanup liabilities related to prior corporate restructuring activities while a division of Varian and fully indemnify Varian for other liabilities arising from the operations of the business transferred to it as part of those activities. Those include facilities sold as part of Varian’s electron devices business in 1995 and thin film systems business in 1997. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or third parties have named Varian as a potentially responsible party under the amended Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), at sites to which Varian or the facilities of the businesses sold in 1995 and 1997 were alleged to have shipped waste for recycling or disposal (the “CERCLA sites”). We anticipate that we will be obligated to reimburse Varian for 20% of the liabilities of Varian related to these CERCLA sites (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds or tax benefits received by Varian). In connection with the CERCLA sites, to date Varian has been required to pay only a small portion of the total cleanup costs and we anticipate that any reimbursement to Varian in the future will not be material. As of September 30, 2022, we had an existing environmental liability of approximately $1.1 million, net of expected insurance proceeds, related to the CERCLA sites.
Working Capital
    Our working capital needs and our credit practices are comparable to those of other companies manufacturing and selling similar products in similar markets. We endeavor to carry sufficient levels of inventory to meet the product delivery needs of our customers. We also provide payment terms to customers in the normal course of business. The product warranty obligations contained in our standard terms and conditions typically range from 12 to 24 months, depending on the product.
Human Capital Resources
Talent Management
    To remain a leading innovator, designer, and manufacturer of critical components of X-ray based diagnostic equipment, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain exceptional talent. Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage our human capital resources, including attracting, identifying, and retaining key talent. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers, wage inflation, the increasing trend towards hybrid work environments, and availability of qualified individuals.
    As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 2,300 full-time and part-time employees worldwide. None of our employees based in the United States are unionized or subject to collective bargaining agreements. Employees based in some foreign countries may, from time to time, be represented by works councils or unions or subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
    As part of our people management strategy, we monitor employee morale and our market reputation. To better understand how to measure the effectiveness of our people management strategy, and to establish a baseline understanding of employee loyalty and retention, we solicit feedback from our employees through employee satisfaction and other surveys. The results of these surveys are analyzed, and we hold meetings with employees to share and discuss areas of improvement. We believe this is a useful process to inform how future decisions are made in order to improve employee morale and engagement.
Total Rewards
    We invest in our workforce by offering a competitive total rewards package that includes a combination of salaries and wages, health and wellness benefits, equity incentives, retirement benefits, and educational benefits. We strive to offer a competitive total rewards package that is responsive to local markets. In the United States, where our largest employee base resides, our benefits for eligible employees have included:
•Health insurance coverage available to full-time employees;
•Tuition reimbursement up to a specified dollar amount on an annual basis;
•Matching contributions to a tax-qualified defined contribution savings ("401(k)") plan, on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to four percent of the employee’s base compensation;
•An employee assistance program; and
•Training and development programs designed to help employees improve workplace performance.
    Approximately 90% of our eligible employees participate in our 401(k) plan, which positions us as a top performer among similarly situated companies. In addition, in an effort to further align the interests of eligible employees with our stockholders, we have an equity-based incentive plan that provides for the grant of nonqualified stock options and restricted stock units to directors, officers and other eligible employees. Additionally, to create performance incentives and to encourage share ownership by our employees, we have implemented an employee stock purchase plan, which enables eligible employees to purchase our common stock at a discount through payroll contributions.
    During fiscal year 2020, due to the impact of COVID-19 on our business, it was necessary to modify or freeze certain benefits historically provided to our employees, such as 401(k) plan matching contributions and tuition reimbursements. During the second half of fiscal year 2021, we reinstated both the 401(k) matching contributions and tuition reimbursement program.
Safety and Wellness 
    The health and safety of our workforce is fundamental to the success of our business. We provide our employees upfront and ongoing safety training to ensure that safety policies and procedures are effectively communicated and implemented. Personal protective equipment is provided to those employees where needed for the employee to safely perform their job function. We have experienced personnel on site at each of our manufacturing locations that are tasked with environmental, health and personal safety education and compliance and, in Salt Lake City, we have an onsite nurse practitioner available to our employees for medical needs.
    The COVID-19 pandemic presented challenges for our workplace. Because our business involves the manufacture of physical products, many of our employees were unable to work from home. In an effort to keep our employees safe and to maintain operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a number of health-related measures and incentivized our employees to become vaccinated. In addition, we implemented a hybrid-office work program where certain employees could work a portion of the workweek from a home office if approved by their leadership. 
Diversity and Inclusion
    As one of our values states, “we embrace equality,” and we are committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace that is respectful to all. Some of our initiatives include providing scholarships to the Society of Women Engineers ("SWE") and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ("STEM") programs, regularly analyzing pay equity, and engaging in on-campus events that increase our exposure to diverse populations to promote diversity in our hiring. We do not tolerate discrimination and harassment, and we expect our teams to conduct themselves ethically at all times in accordance with Varex’s Code of Conduct.
