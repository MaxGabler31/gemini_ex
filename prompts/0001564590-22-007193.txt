 Overview
 Everbridge is a global software company that provides enterprise software applications that automate and accelerate organizations’ operational response to critical events in order to keep people safe and organizations running. During public safety threats including severe weather conditions, active shooter situations, terrorist attacks or a pandemic, as well as critical business events such as Information Technology (“IT”) outages, cyber-attacks, product recalls or supply-chain interruptions, over 6,100 global customers rely on our Critical Event Management (“CEM”) platform to quickly and reliably aggregate and assess threat data, locate people at risk and responders able to assist, automate the execution of pre-defined communications processes through the secure delivery to over 100 different communication channels, and track progress on executing response plans. Our customers use our platform to identify and assess hundreds of different types of threats to their organizations, people, assets or brand. Our solutions enable organizations to deliver intelligent, contextual messages to, and receive verification of delivery from, hundreds of millions of recipients, across multiple communications modalities such as voice, SMS and e-mail, in over 200 countries and territories, in several languages and dialects – all simultaneously. Our Critical Event Management platform is comprised of a comprehensive set of software applications packaged for organizations to address five core use cases, safeguarding: Business Operations, People Resilience, Digital Operations, Smart Security, and Public Safety. Everbridge’s individual products, addressing the full spectrum of tasks an organization requires to manage a critical event, include Mass Notification, Safety Connection, IT Alerting, Visual Command Center, Public Warning, Community Engagement, Risk Center, Crisis Management, CareConverge, Control Center, 911 Connect, Travel Risk Management, SnapComms and E911. As all of our applications leverage our Critical Event Management platform, customers can use a single contacts database, rules engine of algorithms and hierarchies, and user interface to accomplish multiple objectives. We believe that our broad suite of integrated, enterprise applications delivered via a single global platform is a significant competitive advantage in the market for Critical Event Management solutions, which we refer to generally as CEM.
 In critical situations, the speed at which threats are assessed and information is transmitted and accessed is essential. For example, United States Department of Homeland Security research indicates that the average duration of an active shooter event at a school is approximately 12.5 minutes, while the average police response time to such events is 18 minutes. Accordingly, organizations must be able to aggregate multiple types of threat and incident data and determine whether their people, assets, or suppliers could be impacted, rapidly deliver messages that are tailored to multiple, specific audiences, in precise locations and be assured of delivery. Further, the proliferation of mobile and digital communications has resulted in individuals spending less time in a fixed office location, and this trend makes it more complicated for organizations to protect their employees. These developments have made it imperative that organizations be able to locate travelling or remote workers to determine who might be impacted by a critical event, and that critical communications be delivered via voice, SMS, and email, as well as to social media, outdoor signage and personal computers. During public safety threats and critical business events, the ability to gather, organize and analyze data in real time, and to enable secure, scalable, reliable and automated communications to people can be essential to saving lives, protecting assets and maintaining businesses. Further, the ability to rapidly organize a response by locating available responders and using automation to reduce the time required to initiate action can also result in significant economic savings, as, for example, each minute of unplanned IT downtime costs organizations an average of approximately $9,000, according to the Ponemon Institute.
 The following situations reflect examples of how our applications aggregate and assess data and enable improved management of critical events:
  
• | When an active shooter situation or terrorist attack occurs, organizations can quickly identify employees in the affected area, including employees not at their usual business location, in order to confirm that they are safe and provide tailored instructions. For example, shelter-in-place instructions may be provided to people in an impacted building while evacuation instructions are provided to those in an adjacent building. At the same time, first responders and hospitals can use multiple modes of alerting to mobilize resources and call in staff to provide emergency care.

• | When a pandemic such as COVID-19 is underway, corporate, government and healthcare organizations can navigate the complexity of operating during the shutdown phases, supplement or complement existing manual contact tracing efforts and prepare to bring back the workforce and reopen society.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When a hurricane is imminent, local emergency management departments can alert affected communities with relevant safety and evacuation instructions while companies can put in place emergency plans to notify employees of office closures while coordinating work assignments to maintain the continuity of core operations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When emergency operations are required or supply chain events occur, companies can consolidate separate command centers using one common data set to aggregate and assess data on severe weather, political unrest and other types of threats to their own and suppliers’ operations, thereby reducing costs while gaining efficiencies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When IT systems fail, IT administrators can shorten the time required to alert cross-department responders, use scheduling information to determine availability and quickly assemble appropriate personnel on a conference bridge, thereby reducing the costs incurred from downtime.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When a patient is suspected of having a stroke, an on-call specialist can provide a patient assessment via video communications during the ambulance trip and the emergency room can be readied for an immediate stroke treatment, accelerating critical time to treatment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When a cyber incident shuts down an IT network, management can alert employees of the network shutdown via a secure, alternate communication path.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When a power line is down, utility workers can utilize pre-configured incident management templates to alert affected customers and responders and provide service updates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When engine readings in critical equipment detect a malfunction, technicians with the appropriate skills can be automatically alerted and quickly deployed to minimize downtime and avoid revenue loss or service interruption.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When readings from an implanted medical device are abnormal, that information can be automatically routed to the individual’s healthcare provider to enable timely medical care.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When a young child goes missing, local officials can send alerts to and receive tips from their communities to aid in locating and returning the child.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | When a financial services firm experiences disruptions in service, clients can be promptly notified and audit confirmations can be provided to document delivery.

 Industry Background
 Over the past two decades, methods to assess critical events and to automate, accelerate and digitally transform the process of managing and responding to such events have evolved rapidly, in tandem with advances in technology, to include automated or system-generated responses, such as voice calls, text messages, emails, social media and outdoor digital signage. In critical situations, the speed at which threats are assessed and information is transmitted are essential.

Evolution of Critical Event Management Solutions
 Traditional solutions for critical communications have not kept pace with the increasingly digital world, the evolving threat landscape and the opportunity to leverage technological innovation to more effectively gain situational awareness and to communicate with people. These solutions are often developed in-house or are not truly enterprise grade in scale and reliability, leaving many organizations to manually evaluate multiple streams of threat data and to use analog, one-way and people-based modalities to communicate with relevant stakeholders. These solutions lack the scale to reliably address the breadth of the different critical challenges that organizations increasingly face, the sophistication required to address evolving needs with aggregated data and analysis for threat assessment, automated workflows and the ability to rapidly deliver messages that are contextually tailored to multiple, specific audiences, in precise locations, using a variety of different communication modalities. Traditional solutions also typically determine a person’s location for threat assessment and availability for response, and send notifications, based upon a static work or home address. Given the mobile and increasingly remote nature of today’s workforce, solutions now need to be able to dynamically locate who is near a critical event and send instructions to impacted parties and responders based upon where they actually are.
 CEM solutions digitally transform the response to natural, manmade and digital crises, building upon the strengths of modern critical communications with vital data, analytics, correlation, and seamless orchestration. Organizations today typically manage critical events across the organization in silos that use disparate data sources and unintegrated tools, making it difficult to achieve a common operational view of threats and of the status of response. Utilizing a common contact base, consistent rules engines, threat databases that are integrated with information on the location of an organization’s people, assets and suppliers, and a common visualization platform, CEM solutions can provide a more integrated solution which can improve management control and visibility and lower costs. The ability to cohesively and rapidly share information and collaborate across the organization underlies creating a common operational approach.

Our Critical Event Management solutions include:
  
• | Business Operations. The environment in which businesses operate is becoming more and more complex. Critical events such as COVID-19, severe weather, civil unrest and supply chain disruption impact the resilience of businesses. Everbridge Business Operations helps businesses prepare for, and respond to, critical events, protecting facilities and business operations. Built on Everbridge’s industry-leading CEM platform, businesses can detect potential risks which might impact business operations and orchestrate a response in seconds across teams as well as digital and physical systems.

• | People Resilience. The increasing frequency of critical events such as COVID-19, severe weather, and civil unrest over the past few years has challenged many organizations to extend their duty of care responsibilities beyond traditional safety and security in the workplace to include health and wellness of people. At the same time the scope of those responsibilities has moved beyond the traditional office and plant-based work model to work in motion where an employee could be working in the office, at home, in the field, or traveling. Everbridge People Resilience helps businesses prepare for, and respond to, critical events, keeping people healthy, safe, and productive wherever they work or travel around the globe. Built on Everbridge’s industry-leading CEM platform, businesses can detect potential threats that might impact people, and orchestrate a rapid response across teams as well as digital and physical systems.​

• | Digital Operations. The Everbridge Digital Operations Platform goes one step beyond signal enrichment by combining signals from multiple monitoring tools into a relevant context that provides resolvers with clear situational awareness. Massive growth in digital service has both empowered businesses and exposed new vulnerabilities which expands the possibility of threats. A digital operations platform enables agile service delivery models, providing resiliency for IT systems in an increasingly virtual world. Organizations now consider great customer experiences imperative to their business and are pivoting towards streamlining and automating digital operations. As a result, service uptime is crucial to delivering that experience. Through event correlation, incident suppression, signal enrichment, context-rich categorization, and prioritization, organizations can monitor issues and react before an incident becomes a business problem. The Everbridge Digital Operations Platform enables customers to automate remedial actions based on previous incident resolution. Automating digital operations allows teams to open fewer tickets and spend less time chasing or reinventing the same resolution, leading to faster Mean Time to Repair (“MTTR”) and more time for innovation.

• | Smart Security. Everbridge Smart Security helps organizations maintain control of their security by identifying threats to their people or assets and orchestrating a rapid response across teams and systems, all within an easy-to-use common platform. Theft, vandalism, violence, civil unrest, terrorism, and natural disasters are just some of the critical events security practitioners are faced with today. Keeping people safe and assets secure in the face of ever-increasing and ever-more diverse threats is a constant challenge for many organizations. Operations also continue to grow, involving more systems, more users, and much more data. All of this can be difficult to manage and costly to control. When a critical event unfolds and information floods an organization, it needs to get the right information to the right people at the right time to protect its people and their assets and to ensure operational continuity.

• | Public Safety. Public Safety harnesses the ability to monitor critical events, alert the population, and mobilize a coordinated response across multiple agencies. The frequency of natural and human-made disasters is on the rise, and simultaneously, monitoring, collaborating, and communicating during incidents is becoming increasingly complex. For over 20 years, we have partnered with governments worldwide. From fires or floods to terrorist attacks, we have monitored potential hazards to help governments prepare and respond to incidents, and effectively provide the right people with the right information. Be it a country-wide emergency or a neighborhood outage, communities rely on Everbridge to keep them informed and safe.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also have expanded our CEM platform through a series of recent acquisitions, including RedSky, xMatters and Anvil.

With enterprise grade redundancy, scalability and uptime, the Everbridge platform reaches residents and visitors in more than 200 countries and territories.
 Our Technology
 The design and development of our applications, and our critical communication and critical event management platforms include the following key attributes:
  
• | Robust, Enterprise-Grade Scalability and Reliability. Given the mission-critical nature of our solutions, our multi-tenant platform was designed to provide a robust, high level of resiliency, scalability and redundancy. We use multiple geographically distributed service providers and communications carriers to achieve a high degree of redundancy, fault tolerance and cost-effective operations. We have multiple layers of redundancy and a horizontal scaling model across our infrastructure to deliver high availability and performance. Similarly, we leverage redundant downstream communications providers to enable our services to remain uninterrupted even if a particular provider encounters technical difficulties.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Multi-Modal, Globally Local Communications Delivery. We optimize international call routing across hundreds of telecommunications providers to enable higher voice quality, improved delivery rates during emergencies and the ability to configure local caller IDs to improve recognition and answer rates. We also work with multiple SMS providers to identify regulatory hurdles and deploy and actively manage an optimal mix of national and international SMS codes to ensure high delivery and response rates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Security and Compliance. Our solutions received designation under the SAFETY Act, and certification by U.S. Department of Homeland Security that places us on the approved product list for homeland security. Our solutions are also accredited under FISMA. Our Everbridge Suite solution also achieved authorization under FedRAMP in 2018, that required satisfying a rigorous security and risk management review process and which we believe provides an advantage for selling into the U.S. federal sector. In 2019, our Critical Event Management platform received ISO 27001 certification and also received C5 accreditation under the Federal Office for Information Security in Germany.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hybrid Infrastructure. To provide highly scalable and global solutions, we employ redundant, geographically diverse production implementations of our platform infrastructure in multiple SOC 2-compliant data center facilities in North America and Europe. Within each data center, we utilize a hybrid-cloud architecture that enables us to leverage both proprietary and third-party infrastructure services to enable “on-demand” capacity and performance without substantial upfront investment. Our architecture enables our platform to dynamically determine the best location from which to deliver critical communications on behalf of our customers and solves many international communications delivery challenges by utilizing in-country or in-region telephony, messaging and data communication providers. Our infrastructure is continuously maintained and monitored by dedicated engineers based in redundant network operations centers in the Los Angeles and Boston areas.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Dynamic Location Detection. Our platform can create and update dynamic data sets containing a contact’s last-known location, including the airport, street, building floor or conference room at which the contact was most recently present. Multiple data sources can be aggregated including building access control and badging systems, wired and wireless network access points, and corporate travel management and office hoteling systems. These data are used to best locate a contact in an emergency or critical business situation, independent of the contact’s home or office location. Contacts can also share their location via a three-in-one mobile panic button application, which sends a panic message to the applicable organization’s security team, and also includes the ability to send audio and video content, to check-in to capture and report geo-location data and to establish a safe corridor through a potentially unsafe area.

Sales and Marketing
 Our sales and marketing organizations collaborate to create brand preference, efficiently and effectively generate leads, build a strong sales pipeline and cultivate customer relationships to help drive revenue growth. Our marketing strategy consists of a strong thought-leadership program, digital marketing engine and a diversified sales organization designed to efficiently sell across vertical markets to organizations of all sizes. We have dedicated sales teams focused on corporate customers, healthcare organizations and government customers, which covers U.S. federal, state and local governmental entities.
Sales
 We sell our solutions through our telephone and direct inside sales teams, a direct field sales team and a growing partner channel. Our global sales teams focus on both new customer acquisition and up-selling and cross-selling additional and new offerings, respectively, to our existing customers. Our sales teams are organized by geography, consisting of the Americas; Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (collectively, “EMEA”); as well as by target organization size. Our inside sales team focuses typically on small and middle-market transactions, while larger or more complex transactions are generally handled by our direct field sales teams. Our highly trained sales engineers help define customer use cases, manage pilots and train channel partners.
 In addition to the vertical and geographic distribution of our salesforce, we have dedicated teams of account executives focused on net new accounts and growth of existing accounts, account managers responsible for renewal of existing accounts, and business development representatives targeting new and growth business opportunity creation. Our sales representatives use phone, email and web meetings to interact with prospects and customers. In 2021, we increased the headcount of our sales organization, and we intend to continue to invest in building our global sales and go-to-market organizations.
 We also sell through channel partners both domestically and internationally. To help integrate our applications with other third-party services and take advantage of current and emerging technologies, we seek to enter into alliances with leading technology companies.
 Marketing
 We focus our marketing efforts on increasing the strength of the Everbridge brand, communicating product advantages and business benefits, generating leads for our salesforce and channel partners, leveraging geographic market strengths and driving product adoption. We run campaigns that take advantage of a network effect in which success within a region encourages other organizations within that area to choose our solutions, in part to be using a system consistent with that of other entities in the area with which they may share information or best practices. We deliver targeted content to demonstrate our thought leadership in critical communications best practices and use digital advertising methods to drive conversion of potential prospects, which convert to opportunities for our sales organization.
 Our marketing team focuses on inbound marketing through our industry-leading content, resources, and sharing customer best practices. We rely on multiple marketing and sales automation tools to efficiently market to, and automatically identify qualified individuals using product and industry specific criteria. We use multiple marketing tactics to engage with prospective customers including: email marketing, event marketing, print and digital advertising, and webinar events. We engage with existing customers to provide vertically-based education and awareness and to promote expanded use of our current and new software offerings within these customers. We also host regional and national events to engage both customers and prospects, deliver product training and foster community.
 16


Research and Development
 We invest substantial resources in research and development and leverage offshore development in multiple geographies to implement a “follow the sun” engineering strategy and to increase the efficiency of our overall development efforts. We enhance our core technology platform and applications, develop new end market-specific solutions and applications, and conduct application and quality assurance testing. Our technical and engineering team monitors and tests our applications on a regular basis, and we maintain a regular release process to refine, update, and enhance our existing applications.
Our Competition
 The market for CEM solutions is highly fragmented, intensely competitive and constantly evolving. We compete with an array of established and emerging companies, many of whom are single product or single market focused, as well as in-house solutions. We view CEM as a holistic solution that allows organizations to digitally transform their critical event management processes. These processes are siloed in a variety of ways in different organizations. Similarly, solutions from competitors in the field often are siloed by smaller functions across the holistic CEM solution. CEM includes Mass Notification, Risk Control, Public Warning, IT Alerting and Incident Management, and Control Center systems. The primary competitors for our Mass Notification applications include BlackBerry Limited, F24 AG, OnSolve, LLC, and Rave Wireless, Inc. The primary competitors for our Risk Center application include Crisis24 Limited and Dataminr, Inc. The primary competitors for our Public Warning application include Celltick, Intersec and Genasys, Inc. For IT Alerting and Incident Management, our primary competitor is PagerDuty, Inc. For Control Center, our primary competitor is Genetec. Some competitors in siloed solutions are beginning to converge and build strategies that follow our CEM platform strategy. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect the competitive environment to remain intense going forward.
 We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors and that we are well positioned as a leading provider of targeted and contextually relevant critical communications.
 Intellectual Property
 Our future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual protections in the United States and other jurisdictions.
 We have numerous issued patents and patent applications pending. We cannot assure you that any patents will issue from any patent applications, that patents that issue from such applications will give us the protection that we seek or that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future from our pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection and may not be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.
 We have registered the “Everbridge”, “Nixle” and “Visual Command Center” names in the United States and have registered the “Everbridge” name in the European Union. We have registrations and/or pending applications for additional marks in the United States; however, we cannot assure you that any future trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that any registered trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.
 We also license software from third parties for integration into our offerings, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.
 We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include everbridge.com, as well as similar variations on that name.
 17


In order to protect our unpatented proprietary technologies and processes, we rely on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and others. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use them. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or develop similar technologies and processes. Further, the contractual provisions that we enter into may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights.
 If we become more successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop solutions that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our solutions infringe their proprietary rights.
 Patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in our industry and we have been involved in such disputes from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us. They may also assert such claims against our customers whom we typically indemnify against claims that our solution infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates the intellectual property rights of third parties. As the numbers of products and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. Any claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business.
 Government Regulation
 The legal environment of Internet-based businesses is evolving rapidly in the United States and elsewhere. The manner in which existing laws and regulations are applied in this environment, and how they will relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, is often unclear. For example, we sometimes cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business, including with respect to such topics as data privacy and security, pricing, advertising, taxation, and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
 Our customers, and those with whom they interact using our product and platform solutions, upload and store personally identifiable information and other data into our solutions and provide access to such data, generally without any restrictions imposed by us. This presents legal challenges to our business and operations, such as rights of privacy related to the data used in connection with our solutions. Both in the United States and internationally, we must monitor and comply with a host of legal concerns regarding the data stored and processed in our solutions by customers. We must also monitor and comply with these issues directly in the operation of our business in these jurisdictions.
 We are subject to data privacy and security regulation by data protection authorities in countries throughout the world, by the U.S. federal government, and by the states in which we conduct our business. In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of personal information of individuals. Many governing authorities have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and public officials, or amending existing laws to expand compliance obligations. In the European Union, U.S. companies must meet specified privacy and security standards, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which governs the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data, and on the free movement of such data established in the European Union to certain non-European Union countries, such as the United States. Additionally, the data protection laws of each of the European member countries require comprehensive data privacy and security protections for consumers with respect to personal data collected about them. In February 2016, the European Union and U.S. officials announced an agreement, which established the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, or the Privacy Shield, as a means for legitimating the transfer of personal data by U.S. companies doing business in Europe from the 
 18


European Economic Area to the U.S. However, on July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice invalidated the Privacy Shield. As a result, we are no longer using the Privacy Shield as a legal mechanism for the transfer of data between the EU and the U.S. However, the European Court of Justice upheld the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses, which we will continue to use as a legal mechanism for the transfer of data between the EU and the U.S. We have and will continue to engage in efforts to ensure that data transfers from the European Economic Area comply with the GDPR and the data protection legislation of individual member states.
 In the United States, many federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, that among other things, requires covered entities to provide new disclosures to California consumers, affords such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and gives such consumers a private right of action to enforce data breaches resulting from the covered entity's violation of its duty to implement and maintain reasonable security measures. 
 For a discussion of risks related to these various areas of government regulation, see Risk Factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Human Capital Management
 Culture and Governance
 Culture
 We believe that our culture has been a key contributor of our success to-date and that our mission, with the critical nature of the solutions that we provide, promotes a sense of greater purpose and fulfillment for our employees. We have invested in building an intentional global culture and believe it represents one of our most important and sustainable sources of competitive advantage.
Governance
 Our Board of Directors and Board committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors acts on behalf of the Board to review, adopt and approve our compensation strategy, policies, plans and programs, including, among others, reviewing and approving corporate performance goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our executive officers and other senior management, evaluating and approving the compensation plans and programs advisable for us, and administration of our equity compensation plans, stock purchase plan, bonus plans, and other similar plans and programs.
Diversity and Inclusion 
 We prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) to create a workplace that reflects the customers and populations we serve. We demonstrate our commitment to DEI by focusing on several key initiatives.  This includes aligning our hiring and recruiting practices to attract a diverse and talented workforce; creating employee resource groups dedicated to celebrating and empowering communities within our organization, including women, employees of color, employees who identify as LGBTQ+, and members of the military and first responders; holding open forums for company-wide discussion and dialogue on civil unrest and equal justice; and supporting a growing ecosystem of minority-owned and led suppliers and partners. As of December 31, 2021, 31% of our global workforce was female, 31% of vice president and above roles globally were female, and non-Caucasian employees represented 22% of our U.S. workforce. We are committed to increasing the diversity of our workforce, and during the year ended December 31, 2021, 38% of our U.S. hires were female and 27% were non-Caucasian. 
Labor Practices and Policies
 Work Hours, Wages and Benefits
 We compensate employees competitively relative to the industry and local labor market. We work to ensure full compliance with applicable wage, work hours, overtime and benefits laws. We assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation and benefits programs.
 19


In addition to salaries, our compensation and benefit programs (which may vary by country and location) include annual bonuses, stock-based compensation awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, retirement savings plans, healthcare and insurance benefits including long-term care insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, volunteer time off, parental leave, adoption assistance and military leave, among many other benefits. 
Safe and Healthy Workplace and Workplace Security
 We seek to comply with all health and safety laws applicable to our business. To this end, we consult with employees to help keep work areas safe and free of hazardous conditions. Additionally, we are committed to maintaining a workplace free from violence, harassment, intimidation and other unsafe or disruptive conditions due to internal and external threats. We believe it is paramount to use our own CEM solutions to help us achieve our health and safety goals. We continue to take a variety of measures, including by using our own CEM solutions, to communicate to our employees and help keep them safe.  
COVID-19 Pandemic
 During the COVID-19 pandemic we have taken, and continue to take, a variety of measures to ensure the availability and functioning of our critical infrastructure, to promote the safety and security of our employees and to support the communities in which we operate. These measures include requiring remote working arrangements for employees where practicable, among other modifications. We are following evolving public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions, the promotion of social distancing and the adoption of work-from-home arrangements. All of these policies and initiatives have been and may continue to impact our operations. We formed a dedicated, cross-functional task force to monitor the evolving pandemic conditions globally and provide guidance and resources to support employees during the crisis. We continue to actively monitor the situation and are developing a future of work model that take into account our evolving business operations and are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and stockholders.
Workforce, Recruiting, Development and Retention
 Workforce Size
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,952 full-time employees, including 497 in data center operations and customer support, 655 in sales and marketing, 579 in research and development and 221 in general and administrative. As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,078 full-time employees in the United States and 874 full-time employees internationally. None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Recruiting
 Our key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions. Measurements of our progress include the percentage of internal candidates sourced and attrition rates. During 2021, 11% of positions were filled by candidates sourced internally and our attrition rate was 22%. We also develop our talent pipeline with programs such as our internship program. During 2021, we hired 40 interns across various departments and geographies, representing 33% gender diversity. 
Workforce Development 
 We are committed to investing in our employees through professional training and development to ensure the highest possible performance for our customers while retaining our employees to grow their careers at Everbridge. We achieve this through several avenues, including skills training within functional departments, education reimbursement and a Manager Development Program. The Manager Development Program was created to help grow our people managers and provide a path to leadership. We offer a wide variety of content and resources to maximize development. Since the program started in 2019, nearly 200 employees have participated in training and there was 100% agreement by respondents that the program achieved their expectations and should be continued.
 The Everbridge Performance Management Program was designed to meet several key objectives including providing feedback to enhance performance, providing developmental guidance to grow skills, experience and careers, aligning individual effort to organizational objectives and recognizing achievements and contributions. During 2021, participation in the annual review process was 100%.
 20


The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors develops and periodically reviews with our Chief Executive Officer plans for succession to the offices of our executive officers and makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the selection of appropriate individuals to succeed to these positions.
 Employee Engagement and Satisfaction 
 We conduct an annual employee engagement survey to gauge overall employee satisfaction. The survey is an opportunity for employees to provide anonymous feedback on topics ranging from leadership and management, to opportunities for career growth, to work-life balance and diversity, equity and inclusion. The results of the survey are used to develop our annual corporate and department business plans as well as direct the efforts of our People team.  
 In a survey conducted by Comparably measuring employee sentiment across over 60,000 U.S. companies, we won four 2021 Comparably Awards including Best Company Outlook and Best Global Culture, ranking in the top 50 in the largest company category. In addition, Everbridge Customer Success Leader won the 2021 Stevie® Award honoring worldwide Sales Executives. The Stevie Awards were created in 2002 to honor and generate public recognition of the achievements and positive contributions of organizations and working professionals worldwide. Now in its 15th year, the Stevie Awards remain highly sought-after worldwide, exemplifying achievement in business by organizations and individuals across more than 60 nations. In 2020, we were designated as a “Great Place to Work” in the United States and were re-certified in 2021. Based on employee feedback, we have been recognized for our culture, mission and leadership by Great Place to Work®, a global evaluator of workplace culture. 
Environment
 Across the globe, both public and private sectors are more concerned than ever about addressing climate change and its associated risks. During severe weather events, enterprises, small businesses, non-profit organizations, educational institutions and governmental agencies have a responsibility to respond effectively and efficiently in order to protect people, assets, and facilities from harm. As a result, changes in laws and business practices may create more demand for our products in the short and long-term.
 Climate change is driving more severe weather events across the globe. Our multi-tenant platform was designed to navigate mission-critical events and provide a robust, high level of resiliency, scalability and redundancy. We use multiple geographically distributed service providers and communications carriers to achieve a high degree of redundancy, fault tolerance and cost-effective operations. We have multiple layers of redundancy and a horizontal scaling model across our infrastructure to deliver high availability and performance. Similarly, we leverage redundant downstream communications providers to enable our services to remain uninterrupted even if a particular provider encounters technical difficulties.

Legal Proceedings
 From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
