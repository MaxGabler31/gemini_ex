Item 1.  Business
Company Overview
 We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world.  We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Sesame Place and Sea Rescue. Over our more than 50 year history, we have built a diversified portfolio of 12 destination and regional theme parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States, many of which showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection. Our theme parks feature a diverse array of rides, shows, educational demonstrations and other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests.
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, we hosted approximately 20.8 million guests in our theme parks, including approximately 2.4 million international guests, generated total revenues of $1.26 billion and incurred a net loss of $202.4 million, inclusive of a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $269.3 million. See Note 9–Goodwill, Net in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 We generate revenue primarily from selling admission to our theme parks and from purchases of food, merchandise and other spending. For the year ended December 31, 2017, theme park admissions accounted for approximately 61% of our total revenue, and food, merchandise and other revenue accounted for approximately 39% of our total revenue. Over the same period of time, we reported $36.79 in admission per capita (calculated as admissions revenue divided by total attendance) and $23.96 in-park per capita spending (calculated as food, merchandise and other revenue divided by total attendance).
 As one of the world’s foremost zoological organizations and a global leader in animal welfare, training, husbandry, veterinary care and marine animal rescue, we are committed to helping protect and preserve the environment and the natural world. For more information, see the “—Animal Care and Rescue”, “—Sustainable Operations” and “—Conservation and Community Relations” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Recent Developments
 Leadership Changes
 On February 26, 2018, Joel K. Manby stepped down from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and resigned as a member of our Board of Directors and the Board of Directors appointed John T. Reilly, our Chief Parks Operations Officer to serve as Interim Chief Executive Officer and approved a decrease in its size from nine to eight.  In connection with the departure of Mr. Manby and the appointment of Mr. Reilly as Interim Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors appointed the Chairman of the Board, Yoshikazu Maruyama to serve as Executive Chairman of the Board, effective February 26, 2018, until a successor for Mr. Manby is appointed on a permanent basis, at which time Mr. Maruyama is expected to resume his position as Chairman of the Board.
Goodwill Impairment 
 Due to financial performance, particularly late in the second quarter of 2017 at our SeaWorld Orlando park which was driven primarily by a decline in U.S. domestic and international attendance at that park, we determined a triggering event had occurred that required an interim goodwill impairment test for our SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit. Based on the results of the interim goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2017, we determined that the SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit’s goodwill was fully impaired and recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $269.3 million in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2017.  See Note 9–Goodwill, Net in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Restructuring Program
 In October 2017, we executed a restructuring program in an effort to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, reduce duplication of functions and improve the Company’s operations (the “2017 Restructuring Program”). The 2017 Restructuring Program involved the elimination of approximately 350 positions by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 across certain of our theme parks and corporate headquarters. As a result, we recorded $5.2 million in pre-tax restructuring charges and other related costs in 2017 associated primarily with severance and other termination benefits. See Note 4–Restructuring Programs and Separation Costs in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
 On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).  The Tax Act makes significant modifications to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, including but not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.  The Company’s net deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate tax rate in the year of enactment.  The adjustment related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax asset and liability balances, including the revaluation of amounts originally reported in other comprehensive income, is a net benefit of $1.8 million and is reported as part of benefit from income taxes in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2017 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 14–Income Taxes in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
San Diego Hotel Project
 On January 22, 2018, the Company and Evans Hotel, a premier provider of resort accommodations, entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement to develop, own and operate a hotel project (the “San Diego Hotel Project) to be located on the land that the Company leases from the City of San Diego. See Item 2. Properties – “Lease Agreement with City of San Diego” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The San Diego Hotel Project is subject to the City of San Diego’s approval of a lease amendment, amendment of the master plan and requisite approvals from multiple governmental agencies with jurisdictional oversight including the California Coastal Commission sufficient to permit development of the San Diego Hotel Project as contemplated by the agreement.  The approval process for the San Diego Hotel Project may take up to four years and the costs associated with obtaining such approvals will be shared equally between the Company and Evans Hotel.
International Development Strategy
 We believe that in addition to the growth potential that exists domestically, our brands can also have significant appeal in certain international markets. We are currently assessing these opportunities while maintaining a conservative and disciplined approach towards the execution of our international development strategy.  Thus far, we have identified certain international market priorities as well as our international partners within such select markets. The market priorities were developed based on a specific set of criteria to ensure we expand our brands into the most attractive markets. 
 On March 24, 2017, we announced that an affiliate of Zhonghong Zhuoye Group Co., Ltd. (“ZHG Group”) entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 21% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the “Sale”) from certain affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (“Seller”), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement between ZHG and Seller (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”).  The Sale closed on May 8, 2017.  Also on March 24, 2017, we entered into a Park Exclusivity and Concept Design Agreement (the “ECDA”) and a Center Concept & Preliminary Design Support Agreement (the “CDSA”) with Zhonghong Holding Co., Ltd. (“Zhonghong Holding”), an affiliate of ZHG Group, to provide design, support and advisory services for various potential projects and granted exclusive rights in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau (the “ZHG Territory”). Under the terms of the ECDA, we will work with Zhonghong Holding and a top theme park design company, to create and produce concept designs and development analysis for theme parks, water parks and interactive parks in the ZHG Territory. Under the terms of the CDSA, we will provide guidance, support, input, and expertise relating to the initial strategic planning, concept and preliminary design of Zhonghong Holding’s family entertainment and other similar centers.  
 In December 2016, we announced our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC (“Miral”) to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island (the “Middle East Project”).   As part of this partnership, we are providing certain services pertaining to the planning and design of the Middle East Project, with funding received from Miral expected to offset our internal expenses.  As of December 31, 2017, we have received a nonrefundable payment of $10.0 million from Miral in consideration of the design and planning services described above which is recorded as deferred revenue in other liabilities and have incurred approximately $3.1 million of deferred costs which is recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. On November 3, 2016, the definitive documents related to the Middle East Project were finalized and executed by the parties.  This next generation SeaWorld Abu Dhabi will also introduce the United Arab Emirates’ (“UAE”) first dedicated marine life research, rescue rehabilitation and return center with world-class facilities and resources for the care and conservation of local marine life.  Planned to open ahead of the marine life themed park, the facility will provide an important resource for UAE nationals and residents looking to develop or enhance expertise in marine life sciences and will serve as a hub for collaboration with local and international environmental organizations and projects.  
 SeaWorld Abu Dhabi will be the first new SeaWorld without orcas, and will integrate up-close animal experiences, mega attractions and a world class aquarium, bringing the latest technology in visitor engagement.  SeaWorld Abu Dhabi is expected to open by 2022. The Middle East Project is subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to, the parties completing the design development and there is no assurance that the Middle East Project will be completed or advance to the next stage.

For a discussion of certain risks associated with our international development strategy, including the Middle East Project, see “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We may not realize the benefits of acquisitions or other strategic initiatives.”
 License Agreement
 On May 16, 2017, SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Sesame Workshop (“Sesame”), a New York not-for-profit corporation.  
 The License Agreement extends our status as Sesame Workshop’s exclusive theme park partner in the U.S., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the “Sesame Territory”), with the second Sesame Place theme park scheduled to open no later than mid-2021 in a U.S. location to be determined. After the opening of the second Sesame Place, we will have the option to build additional Sesame Place theme parks in the Sesame Territory. The agreement also makes it possible for Sesame Street characters to continue to appear at the existing distinct Sesame Street lands inside our two Busch Gardens theme parks and SeaWorld theme parks in San Diego and San Antonio, as well as a new Sesame Street land to be built in SeaWorld Orlando by fall 2022.  See the “— Intellectual Property” section included elsewhere on this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Board of Director Changes
 On September 12, 2017, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) elected Yoshikazu Maruyama to serve as Chairperson and Donald C. Robinson to serve as independent Lead Director, in each case effective October 9, 2017. In addition, effective September 12, 2017: the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board is comprised of William Gray, Donald C. Robinson and Ronald Bension, with Donald C. Robinson serving as the chair; the Compensation Committee of the Board is comprised of William Gray, Thomas E. Moloney, and Deborah M. Thomas, with Thomas E. Moloney serving as the chair; and the Audit Committee of the Board is comprised of Ronald Bension, Thomas E. Moloney and Deborah M. Thomas, with Deborah M. Thomas serving as the chair. Additionally, on September 7, 2017, each of David F. D’Alessandro, Judith A. McHale and Ellen O. Tauscher notified the Board of their respective decisions to resign from their positions as members of the Board, effective as of October 9, 2017. Their resignations were not in connection with any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices. 
 
On November 5, 2017, the Company and Hill Path Capital LP (“Hill Path”) entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”) and certain related agreements described below. Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, on November 5, 2017, the Board appointed Scott I. Ross (the “Designee”) to the Board and the recently created Revenue Committee, increasing the total Board to 9 members. The Revenue Committee is a new board committee for the development, articulation and execution of the Company’s short-term and long-term revenue-growth strategies. In accordance with the Company’s Outside Director Compensation Policy, the Designee’s compensation for his services as a non-employee director will be consistent with that of the Company’s other non-employee directors, subject to pro-ration to reflect the commencement date of his service on the Board.
 
On November 5, 2017, the Company also entered into an Undertaking Agreement (the “Undertaking Agreement”) which permits the Designee to provide information to certain personnel of Hill Path and certain of Hill Path’s advisors as described therein. The undertakings of Hill Path and the Designee pursuant to the Undertaking Agreement are effective for 12 months following the date on which there is no director serving on the Board who is designated by Hill Path. The Company also entered into a side letter with Hill Path that provides if it obtains any requisite Board approval or the consent of SunWise (UK) Co. LTD (“ZHG”), the Company will execute and deliver to Hill Path a form of registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”). The Registration Rights Agreement will provide that following the date that is one day after the expiration of the Company’s advance notice period for the nomination of directors at the 2018 Annual Meeting and provided that Hill Path has not submitted any nominations for the election of directors in accordance with the Company’s advance notice period as set forth in the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, the Hill Path entities will have limited shelf registration rights with respect to their common stock (including certain demand underwritten offering rights and piggyback registration rights). The Registration Rights Agreement also will require the Company to pay certain expenses relating to such registration and indemnify the Hill Path entities against certain liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 Other Matters
 During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $8.4 million of equity compensation expense (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and in operating expenses) related to certain performance-vesting restricted shares (the “2.75x Performance Restricted shares”) which partially vested on May 8, 2017 with the closing of the Sale. Additionally, approximately $1.3 million in dividends were paid related to the 2.75x Performance Restricted shares vesting. See Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Regulatory Developments
 On July 16, 2015, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) offered an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2016 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies spending bill during consideration of the bill by the full Committee on Appropriations. The amendment directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) to issue updated regulations for the display of marine mammals in domestic zoos and aquaria within six months of enactment. While that amendment was not included in the final Fiscal Year 2016 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, APHIS released a proposed rule on February 3, 2016 to amend the Animal Welfare Act regulations concerning the humane handling, care and treatment of marine mammals in captivity (the “Proposed APHIS Regulations”).  The Proposed APHIS Regulations were subject to public comment which ended on May 4, 2016.  We submitted a comment letter to APHIS on the final date for comments, expressing our views on the Proposed APHIS Regulations.  The full impact of the Proposed APHIS Regulations on our business will not be known until the Proposed APHIS Regulations are finalized. On January 12, 2018, the Federal Register published the latest Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions.  No proposed regulatory actions were listed for APHIS indicating that the agency does not plan any further action at this time on the matter.  
 On March 23, 2017, Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA) reintroduced the Orca Responsibility and Care Advancement Act (the “ORCA Act”), which he initially introduced in November 2015. The reintroduced bill has been referred to the House Natural Resources and Agriculture Committees. It is unclear whether this bill will be enacted into law, but if enacted, this bill would amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and the Animal Welfare Act to prohibit the breeding, the taking (wild capture), and the import or export of orcas for the purposes of public display.  The reintroduced bill would prohibit the transport of orcas from one park to another but does allow for transport to a “marine mammal sanctuary” and attempts to officially define the term “sanctuary” in law. 
 On April 5, 2016, following the Orca Announcement, a California lawmaker reintroduced the California Orca Protection Act which is a bill that he originally proposed in March 2014.  The bill proposed in 2014 would have ended all captive breeding and display of orcas in California.  Additionally, that bill would have required that all orcas in California be retired to sea pens and/or sanctuaries. That bill was referred to interim study after its first public hearing in 2014. The reintroduced bill proposed in April 2016 seeks to primarily codify the Orca Announcement in California.  On August 26, 2016, this bill was enacted into law and (i) codified the end of captive breeding programs and the export and import of genetic materials for orcas in California, (ii) prohibits the import or export of new orcas into or existing orcas out of California, (iii) permits the transfer of orcas currently in California among existing SeaWorld facilities and (iv) requires educational presentations of orcas in California.  The new orca programs we are developing will be consistent with these standards and began in our San Diego park in 2017. On November 4, 2016, the California Coastal Commission granted approval to permit the renovation of the existing backdrop at the orca habitat at our San Diego park.  This approval allows us to continually develop our new orca program in our San Diego park. On January 7, 2018, a Florida State lawmaker filed a Florida Orca Protection bill, with similar language to the California legislation.  If passed, the bill would have similar implications to the California legislation and as previously discussed, the new orca programs we are developing are consistent with the proposed standards.
 For a discussion of certain risks associated with federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, see “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts.”
 On February 8, 2016, the San Diego City Council put a proposal on the June 7, 2016 primary ballot for voters to decide whether the city of San Diego should have a higher minimum wage than the $10 per hour required by the State of California. The proposal was approved by San Diego voters and, beginning on July 11, 2016, the city’s minimum wage was increased to $10.50 and was increased again to $11.50 on January 1, 2017. Two years later in January 2019, annual increases to the San Diego minimum wage based on the consumer price index will be implemented. For a discussion of certain risks associated with the San Diego minimum wage and State of California minimum wage increases, see “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations.”

Our Competitive Strengths 
  
• | Brands That Consumers Know and Love. We believe our brands attract and appeal to guests from around the world. We use our brands and intellectual property and the work we do to care for animals to increase awareness of our theme parks, drive attendance to our theme parks and create “out-of-park” experiences for our guests as a way to connect with them before they visit our theme parks and to stay connected with them after their visit. Such experiences include various media and consumer product offerings, including websites, advertisements and media programming, toys, books, apparel and technology accessories. For example, we have developed iPhone and Android smartphone applications for our SeaWorld, Busch Gardens and Sesame Place theme parks, which offer GPS navigation through the theme parks and interactive theme park maps that show the nearest dining locations, gift shops and ATMs and provide real-time updates on wait times for rides.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have also leveraged our brands into media, entertainment and consumer products.  We produce two educational and entertaining television shows that highlight our rescue and rehabilitation and animal care efforts, Sea Rescue and The Wildlife Docs.  In 2016, both Sea Rescue and The Wildlife Docs were nominated for the Daytime Emmy® Award in the category of Outstanding Children’s Series by the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. In 2016, Sea Rescue won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children’s Series.  In 2015, both Sea Rescue and The Wildlife Docs were each presented with a silver honor from the Parents' Choice Award®, a nonprofit program created to recognize quality children’s media.  Sea Rescue is a Saturday morning television show airing on the ABC Network featuring our ongoing work to rescue injured animals in coordination with various government agencies and other rescue organizations. The Wildlife Docs, which also airs on the ABC Network on Saturday mornings, centers on the day-to-day activities at our Animal Care Center at Busch Gardens Tampa.  
  
• | Differentiated Theme Parks. We own and operate 12 theme parks, including three of the top 20 theme parks and three of the top 10 water parks in North America as measured by attendance, according to the TEA/AECOM Report. Our theme parks are beautifully themed and deliver high-quality entertainment, aesthetic appeal, shopping and dining and have won numerous awards, including the Amusement Today Golden Ticket Award for Best Landscaping. Our theme parks feature seven of the 50 highest rated steel roller coasters in the world, led by Apollo’s Chariot, the #11 rated steel roller coaster in the world according to the 2017 Amusement Today Annual Survey, and have won the top three spots in the Amusement Today annual Golden Ticket Award for Best Marine Life Park since the award’s inception in 2006 through 2017. In fact, in 2017 and 2015, we won the top four spots for Best Marine Life Park and in 2016, we had four of our theme parks in the top five spots. We have over 600 attractions that appeal to guests of all ages, including 85 animal habitats, 105 shows and 196 rides. In addition, we have over 350 restaurants, photo and specialty retail shops. Our theme parks appeal to the entire family and offer a broad range of experiences, ranging from emotional and educational animal encounters to thrilling rides and exciting shows. As a result of these distinctive offerings, our guest surveys routinely report very high “Overall Satisfaction” scores, with 96% of respondents in 2017 ranking their experience good or excellent. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Diversified Business Portfolio. Our portfolio of theme parks is diversified in a number of important respects. Our theme parks are located in geographic clusters across the United States, which helps protect us from the impact of localized events. Each theme park showcases a different mix of zoological, thrill-oriented and family friendly attractions. This varied portfolio of entertainment offerings attracts guests from a broad range of demographics and geographies. Our theme parks appeal to both regional and destination guests, which provide us with a diversified attendance base while allowing us to benefit from improvements in macroeconomic conditions, including increased consumer spending and international travel.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | One of the World’s Largest Zoological Collections. We believe we are attractively positioned in the industry due to our ability to present our animals in a differentiated and interactive manner. We believe we have one of the world’s largest zoological collections. We have the largest group of killer whales, also known as orcas, in human care. More than 80% of our marine mammals were born in human care. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Competitive Position. Our competitive position is enhanced by the combination of our powerful brands, extensive zoological collection and expertise and attractive in-park assets located on valuable real estate. Our zoological collection and expertise, which have evolved over our more than five decades of caring for animals, would be very difficult and expensive to replicate. We have made extensive investments in new attractions and infrastructure and we believe that our theme parks are well capitalized (see the “— Capital Improvements” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of new rides and attractions). The limited supply of real estate suitable for theme park development coupled with high initial capital investment, long development lead-times and zoning and other land use restrictions constrain the number of large theme parks that can be constructed.

• | Proven and Experienced Management Team and Employees with Specialized Animal Expertise. Our senior management team, currently led by John T. Reilly, Interim Chief Executive Officer, includes some of the most experienced theme park executives in the world, with an average tenure of approximately 17 years in the industry, as of December 31, 2017. The management team is comprised of highly skilled and dedicated professionals with wide ranging experience in theme park operations, zoological operations, product development, business development, marketing, finance and accounting. In addition to the senior management team Yoshikazu Maruyama – a 22-year veteran of the global theme park industry – currently serves as Executive Chairman until a permanent Chief Executive Officer is appointed by the Board, at which time Mr. Maruyama will resume his position as Chairman of the Board. We are also one of the world’s foremost zoological organizations with more than 1,500 employees dedicated to animal welfare, training, husbandry, veterinary care and marine animal rescue.

• | Proximity of Complementary Theme Parks. Our theme parks are grouped in key locations near large population centers across the United States, which allows us to realize revenue and operating expense efficiencies. Having complementary theme parks located within close proximity to each other also enables us to cross market and offer bundled ticket and travel packages. In addition, closely located theme parks provide operating efficiencies including sales, marketing, procurement and administrative synergies as overhead expenses are shared among the theme parks within each region.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Significant Cash Flow Generation. Our disciplined approach to capital expenditures and working capital management enables us to generate significant and recurring annual operating cash flow, even in years of declining performance. Five of our 12 theme parks are open year-round, reducing our seasonal cash flow volatility. In addition, we have substantial tax assets, and we expect such assets to be able to defer a significant portion of our cash tax burden in the near term.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Care for Our Community and the Natural World. We are committed to the communities in which our theme parks are located and focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and community initiatives that address environmental sustainability. Our theme parks inspire and educate children and guests of all ages through experiences that are fun and meaningful. We also partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance, and/or hands-on volunteer work. For example, we are the primary supporter and corporate member of the SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, a non-profit conservation foundation, which makes grants to wildlife research and conservation projects that protect wildlife and wild places worldwide. In addition, we operate one of the world’s most respected rescue programs for ill and injured marine animals, in collaboration with federal, state and local governments, and other members of accredited stranding networks, among others, with the goal of rehabilitating and returning them to the wild. For more than five decades, our animal experts have helped more than 31,000 ill, injured, orphaned and abandoned animals. We are committed to rescue, research and education and invest millions annually in these efforts. In 2014, the SeaWorld Animal Rescue Teams based in San Diego, Orlando and San Antonio were presented the Amusement Today 2014 Persons of the Year Award for their tireless dedication to animal welfare.

Our Theme Parks 
 Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have built our portfolio of strong brands and have strategically expanded our portfolio of theme parks across five states on approximately 2,000 acres of owned land and 190 acres of leased land in San Diego. Our theme parks offer guests a variety of exhilarating experiences, from animal encounters that invite exploration and appreciation of the natural world, to thrilling rides and spectacular shows. Our theme parks are beautifully themed venues that are consistently recognized among the top theme parks in the world and rank among the most highly attended in the industry. 
 In 2016, SeaWorld Orlando ranked among the top 25 theme parks worldwide based on attendance, and Aquatica Orlando ranked among the top 10 water parks worldwide based on attendance, according to the TEA/AECOM Report. In the 2017 Trip Advisor Travelers’ ChoiceTM Awards, 8 of our theme parks were ranked among the top 25 amusement parks or water parks in the United States.  In addition, Discovery Cove was ranked the #2 amusement park in the world in the 2015-2017 Trip Advisor Travelers’ Choice Awards and was ranked the #1 amusement park in the world in the 2013-2014 Trip Advisor Travelers’ Choice Awards. 
 We generally locate our theme parks in geographic clusters, which improve our ability to serve guests by providing them with a varied, comprehensive vacation experience and valuable multi-park pricing packages, as well as improving our operating efficiency through shared overhead costs.  Our portfolio of branded theme parks includes the following names:
  
• | SeaWorld. SeaWorld is widely recognized as the leading marine-life theme park brand in the world. Our SeaWorld theme parks rank among the most highly attended theme parks in the industry and offer up-close interactive experiences, special dining experiences, thrilling attractions and a variety of live performances that immerse guests in the marine-life theme. We also offer our guests numerous animal encounters, including the opportunity to work with trainers and feed marine animals, as well as themed thrill rides and theatrical shows that creatively incorporate our one-of-a-kind zoological collection. Collectively, our theme parks have won the top three spots in the Amusement Today annual Golden Ticket Award for Best Marine Life Park since the award’s inception in 2006 through 2017, and the top four spots in 2015 and 2017, with our Discovery Cove park ranking #3 in those years. We currently own and operate the following SeaWorld branded theme parks:

• | SeaWorld San Diego is the original SeaWorld theme park spanning 190 acres of waterfront property on Mission Bay in San Diego, California.

Maintenance and Inspection
 Safety is of utmost importance to us.  Maintenance at our theme parks is a key component of safety and guest service and includes two areas of focus: (i) facilities and infrastructure and (ii) rides and attractions. Facilities and infrastructure maintenance consists of all functions associated with upkeep, repair, preventative maintenance, code compliance and improvement of theme park infrastructure. This area is staffed with a combination of external contractors/suppliers and our employees.
 Rides and attractions maintenance represents all functions dedicated to the inspection, upkeep, repair and testing of guest experiences, particularly rides. Rides and attractions maintenance is also staffed with a combination of external suppliers, inspectors and our employees, who work to assure that ride experiences are operating within the manufacturer’s criteria and that maintenance is conducted according to internal standards, industry best practice and standards (such as ASTM International), state or jurisdictional requirements, as well as the ride designer or manufacturer’s specifications. All ride maintenance personnel are trained to perform their duties according to internal training processes, in addition to recognized industry certification programs for maintenance leadership. Every ride at our theme parks is inspected regularly, according to daily, weekly, monthly and annual schedules, by both park maintenance experts and external consultants. Additionally, all rides are inspected daily by maintenance personnel before use by guests to ensure proper and safe operation.
 A networked enterprise software system is used to plan and track various maintenance activities, in order to schedule and request work, track completion progress and manage costs of parts and materials.
 Deep Blue Creative
 In 2016, we created the Deep Blue Creative team, designed to drive the creative heartbeat of the Company. From the development of new events and entertainment concepts, to breakthrough attractions and resorts, the Deep Blue Creative team is committed to developing experiences that matter. There are six creative divisions under the umbrella of Deep Blue Creative: 

• | Theme Park Development | U.S.A.: Responsible for creating innovative culinary experiences, retail environments, and attractions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Theme Park Development | Global: Leads the development of all theme park growth initiatives beyond existing parks, including international expansion.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Resort Development: Responsible for the business and creative development of resorts and hotels.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Events & Entertainment: Supports theme park entertainment teams in staging live experiences for both theatrical settings, along with culinary and retail environments
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Media Enterprises: Leads our television business, including our original television series, Sea Rescue and The Wildlife Docs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expedition X: Focuses on prototype development for innovative project concepts and new technology exploration.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Animal Care and Rescue
 We provide care for one of the largest zoological collections in the world. Our commitment to these animals includes applying world-class standards of care while striving to provide habitats reflective of the latest scientific knowledge. Our more than 1,500-person strong animal care team is among the most experienced and qualified in the world, making SeaWorld a global leader in animal welfare, husbandry, enrichment and veterinary care.
 All three SeaWorld parks, Discovery Cove and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay are accredited members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), one of the foremost professional zoological organizations in the world. In addition, our three SeaWorld parks and Discovery Cove are accredited by the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (AMMPA), an association specifically focused on the care of marine mammals. SeaWorld’s facilities have also received accreditation from the International Marine Animal Trainers’ Association (IMATA), whose Animal Trainer Development Program was developed to recognize those facilities that have exceptional systems for training animal care givers in the science and art of animal training, while utilizing positive reinforcement. 
 We take a comprehensive approach to ensuring the health of the animals in our care that focuses on physical, behavioral and population health. Our animal care team includes board-certified veterinarians, technicians and animal care experts, and we have onsite animal hospitals at each SeaWorld park and a guest-facing, state-of-the-art Animal Care Center at our Busch Gardens park in Tampa, Florida. We have also been at the forefront of advancing understanding and best practice-related behavioral health in animals. 
 We are committed to caring for each individual animal, and to being responsible stewards of our animal populations. That includes ensuring that we maintain the genetic diversity needed for healthy and self-sustaining populations. We have invested significantly in developing leading-edge reproductive health expertise, technologies and capabilities. More than 80% of the marine animals living in our zoological theme parks were born in human care. Our focus on population health is also driven by our goal of helping to support, and our participation in, Species Survival Plans, which are programs that are ultimately aimed at preserving species in the wild. 
 13

We apply high quality and comprehensive animal care standards, and actively work to advance knowledge and improve standards. We do this by contributing to research and sharing our insights with other zoological organizations. For example, our early work to define the clinically normal, healthy ranges for key measures in marine animals in our parks helped to establish the standards used by many veterinarians to assess both wild and managed marine species. 
 In 2016, SeaWorld announced it was ending its orca breeding program. That means that the orcas currently in our care will be the last generation at SeaWorld. They will continue to receive the highest-quality care based on the latest advances in marine veterinary medicine, science and zoological best practices for the rest of their lives. In 2017, we began introducing new orca encounters, which resemble live-action nature documentaries and focus on the research, education, care and respect that align with our mission to advance the well-being and conservation of these beautiful animals.
 SeaWorld is also a leader in animal rescue. Over the last five decades through December 31, 2017, we have helped more than 31,000 ill, injured, orphaned or abandoned animals in need of our expert care. Working in partnership with state, local and federal agencies, our SeaWorld Rescue Team is on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.
 Our commitment to animals also extends beyond our theme parks and throughout the world. We actively participate in species conservation and rescue efforts as discussed in the “—Sustainable Operations” and “—Conservation & Community Relations” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Our Products and Services
 Admission Tickets
 We generate most of our revenue from selling admission to our theme parks. For the year ended December 31, 2017, theme park admissions accounted for approximately 61% of our total revenue. We engage with travel agents, ticket resellers and travel agencies, and directly with our guests through our websites and social media, to promote advanced ticket sales and provide guest convenience and ease of entry. Approximately 45% of our admission revenues are from ticket purchases made online.
 Guests who visit our theme parks have the option of purchasing multiple types of admission tickets, from single and multi-day tickets to season and annual passes. We also offer a Fun Card at select theme parks that allows multiple visits throughout a calendar year. In addition, visitors can purchase vacation packages with preferred hotels, behind-the-scenes tours, specialty dining packages and front of the line “Quick Queue” access to enhance their experience.
 We also participate in joint programs that are designed to provide visitors to certain markets with flexibility and value in creating their vacation itineraries. We have partnered with several theme parks and attractions to create joint ticket products which allow guests to purchase a ticket providing access to our theme parks as well as other local area attractions.  We also partner with independent third parties who sell tickets and/or packages to our theme parks.
 We actively use pricing and promotions to manage capacity and maximize revenue. In 2017 and 2016, we introduced demand-based pricing for select peak time periods at several of our parks, advance purchase discounts to encourage early commitment, and seasonal pricing models to drive demand in non-peak time periods. We continue to optimize our web experience to focus on increasing average order value through suggestive up-selling, offering multi-day tickets and vacation packages.
 Theme Park Operations
 Our theme park operations strive to deliver a high level of safety, security, guest service and cleanliness at our theme parks. The theme park operations team manages the planning and execution of the overall theme park experience on a daily basis, which is comprised of rides, shows and attractions operations, safety, security, environmental, water park and guest arrival services (including parking, tolls, admissions, guest relations, entry and exit).  Our theme park operations team identifies and leverages internal best practices across all of our theme parks in order to create a seamless and enjoyable guest experience throughout the entire visit.

Culinary Offerings
 We strive to deliver a variety of high quality, creative and memorable culinary experiences to our guests. Our culinary operations are strategically organized into five key guest-oriented disciplines designed to drive in-park per capita spending: restaurants, catering, carts and kiosks, specialty snacks and vending. Our culinary team focuses on providing creative menu offerings and ways to deliver those offerings that appeal to our diverse guest base.
 We offer a variety of dining programs that provide quality food and great value to our guests and drive incremental revenues. While our menu offerings have broad appeal, they also cater to guests who desire healthy options and those with special allergy-related needs. Our successful all-day-dining program delivers convenience and value to our guests with numerous restaurant choices for one price. We also offer creative immersive dining experiences that allow guests to dine up-close with our animals and characters. Our commitment to care for the natural world extends to the food that we serve. Some of our menus feature sustainable, organic, seasonal and locally grown ingredients that aim to minimize environmental impacts to animals and their habitats. In addition, through culinary supply chain management initiatives, we are well-positioned to take advantage of changing economic and market conditions.
 Merchandise
 We offer guests the opportunity to capture memories through our products and services, including through traditional retail shops, game venues and customized photos and videos. We make a focused effort to leverage the emotional connection of the theme park experiences, capitalize on trends and optimize brand alignment with our merchandise product offerings.
 We operate over 250 photo and specialty retail shops at our theme parks, and our retail business encompasses the entire value chain, from product design to production and sourcing, importing and logistics and visual presentation up to the point of sale. Our products encompass more than 56,000 unique SKUs annually. Whether a plush toy, a stylish apparel item showcasing an attraction, a commemorative memento or a tote to carry it all, we carry items both big and small so that every guest has a chance to find that perfect item that is a reminder of the memories made in our theme parks.
 Guests can purchase visual memories to commemorate their experience with us through real time photo and video technologies. Whether on a traditional ride or during one of our numerous animal experiences, we capture the moment through the use of state-of-the-art processes and technologies. We continue to explore and develop our photo and retail business with advanced offerings to extend beyond the visit with online opportunities to further create customized products. An example is PhotoKey through which guests can instantly view and share all of their photos using the PhotoKey app available on their smartphone devices.
 In-park games span from traditional theme park operations to arcade experiences, all with the goal of creating positive family experiences for guests of every age.  Our merchandise teams also focus on making a visit to our theme parks easy, convenient and comfortable. This includes offering lockers or service vehicle rentals such as strollers, electric personal carts and wheelchairs.
 Licensing, Consumer Products and Media Enterprises
 To capitalize on our popular brands, we leverage content through media and licensing arrangements. Our original television series, Sea Rescue and The Wildlife Docs, showcase our rescue and rehabilitation efforts. These Emmy-nominated programs are broadcast nationally through the ABC network, and have been renewed through the summer of 2018. In 2016, Sea Rescue won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children’s Series.  We also developed licensed consumer products to drive consumer sales through retail channels beyond our theme parks and continue to look for this channel to grow. 
 In addition, we have expanded our brand appeal through strategic alliances with well-known external brands, including Sesame Street.  Beginning in 2016, we incorporated Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and other well-known characters into five of our park holiday programs under a license agreement with Character Arts, LLC. While currently these licensed consumer products do not represent a material percentage of our total revenue, we believe by leveraging our brands and our intellectual property through media and consumer products, we will create new revenue streams and enhance the value of our brands through greater brand visibility, consumer awareness and increased consumer loyalty.
 Group Events and Conventions
 We host a variety of different group events, meetings and conventions at our theme parks both during the day and at night. Our venues offer indoor and outdoor space for meetings, special events, entertainment shows, picnics, teambuilding events, group tours and special group ticket packages. Park buy-outs allow groups to enjoy exclusive itineraries, including meetings and shows, up-close encounters with animals and behind the scenes tours. Each of our theme parks offers attractive venues, such as SeaWorld Orlando’s Ports of Call, a 70,000 square foot dedicated special events complex and banquet facility at the theme park, which is themed as a nautical wharf-side warehouse district. The facility offers more than 30,000 square feet of dining space, with a ballroom that provides seating for more than 750 guests and a larger outdoor garden reception area that can accommodate additional guests. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we hosted close to 1,400 group events at our theme parks across the country.

Corporate Sponsorships and Strategic Alliances
 We seek to secure long-term corporate sponsorships and strategic alliances with leading companies and brands that share our core values, deliver significant brand value and influence and drive mutual business gains. We identify prospective corporate sponsors based on their industry and industry-leading position, and we select them based on their ability to deliver impactful value to our theme parks and our brands, as well as to consumer products and various entertainment platforms. Our corporate sponsors contribute to us in a multitude of ways, such as through direct marketing, advertising, media exposure and licensing opportunities, as well as through contributions to the non-profit SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund.
Our Corporate Culture
 As a purpose-driven company, our corporate culture is built on our mission to provide experiences that matter for every guest, inspiring them to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world.  Our management team and our employees, often referred to as ambassadors, are committed to connect people to nature and animals and to do so in a socially responsible manner. As guests explore our parks, we train our ambassadors to create an environment where each guest can explore a diverse range of experiences meant to inspire and motivate them to join us in protecting animals and our planet. Our purpose and focus on creating experiences that matter for our guests are integral to our organization and the cornerstone of our success.
Sustainable Operations 
 Environmental conservation is implicit in our purpose. To thrive, animals need vibrant ecosystems and healthy habitats. We understand the adverse effects of human behavior and climate change on ecosystems and the animals who call them home; therefore, we are constantly working to minimize the footprint of our operations. As a part of our commitment to conservation, we have invested in numerous projects to reduce our energy and water use and the amount of waste we generate.
 Our parks have some of the most advanced and efficient water purification systems in the world, which provide the optimum environment for our marine life. We leverage this knowledge to reclaim and recycle wastewater for reuse, thereby decreasing our consumption of fresh water. We have also implemented a range of other water conservation efforts across our parks. Many of these incorporate lessons from our facilities in San Diego and San Antonio, which, driven in part by drought conditions, have found innovative opportunities to harvest rainwater, reuse water for cooling buildings and adapt landscaping to require less water. We continually look for new ways to reduce water use in our parks and to support water conservation projects elsewhere.
 Conservation and Community Relations
 Our purpose is to inspire people to protect animals and the wild wonders of the world, and a critical way we deliver on this is by providing our guests opportunities to explore and interact with the animals in our parks. Through our up-close animal encounters, educational exhibits and innovative entertainment, we strive to inspire each guest to take action to care for and conserve the natural world. Some of the animals in our care serve as ambassadors for their species through numerous national media and public appearances that educate the public and raise awareness for issues facing wildlife and wild places.  We also partner with and support leading research, education and conservation organizations that help protect species of animals at risk in the wild, as well as the habitats that are home to many vulnerable species. 
 We have supported conservation organizations such as the Killer Whale Research and Conservation Program, in partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, to study and protect endangered killer whales in the wild, with a particular focus on the Southern Resident killer whale population found off the coast of Washington. Another example is a partnership with marine wildlife artist and conservationist Guy Harvey focused on ocean health and the plight of sharks in the wild. We also continue to support the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, which was started over 50 years ago by one of SeaWorld’s founders and remains a world-renowned scientific research organization committed to conserving and renewing marine life to ensure a healthier planet.
 Alongside our conservation work, we are committed to giving back to the communities in which our theme parks are located. We focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and community initiatives that address environmental sustainability. We partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance and/or hands-on volunteer work. Through our SeaWorld Cares, Busch Gardens Cares and Sesame Place Cares initiatives, our employees are actively involved in volunteer activities, such as beach and river cleanup efforts
 Our Guests and Customers
 Our theme parks are located near a number of large metropolitan areas, with a total population of over 63 million people located within 150 miles of our parks. Additionally, because our theme parks are divided between regional and destination theme parks, our guests include local visitors, non-local domestic visitors and international tourists. Our theme parks are entertainment venues and have broad demographic appeal. For the year ended December 31, 2017, families comprised 54% of our attendance with an average party size of 3.8 people.

Seasonality
 The theme park industry is seasonal in nature. Historically, we generate the highest revenues in the second and third quarters of each year, in part because seven of our theme parks are only open for a portion of the year. Approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues are generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we typically incur a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. The percent mix of revenues by quarter is relatively constant each year, but revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of Christmas and New Year. Even for our five theme parks open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. One of our goals is to continue to generate cash flow throughout the year to maximize profitability and minimize the effects of seasonality, in particular at our theme parks that are open year-round. In recent years, we have begun to drive attendance during non-peak times by offering a variety of seasonal programs and events, such as shows for kids, special food and concert series, and Halloween and Christmas events. In addition, during seasonally slow times, operating costs are controlled by reducing operating hours and show schedules. Employment levels required for peak operations are met largely through part-time and seasonal hiring.
Marketing
 Our marketing, sales and revenue management sales efforts are focused on generating profitable attendance, growing in-park per capita spending and building the value of our brands. We differentiate our brands by building emotive and exciting communications that bring to life our mission: to deliver experiences that matter.  We use advertising, promotions, public relations, digital and social media, retail and corporate partners, sales distribution and pricing strategies to create awareness and engagement, and ultimately drive visits to our theme parks and water parks. Our strategies to build park attractions that are both fun and meaningful increase opportunities for better in-park spending and merchandise sales.  Our attractive destination locations and strategy of grouping parks together creates high appeal for multi-day visits. Our strategic priorities include: (i) increasing brand favorability, awareness and visit intent, (ii) strengthening loyalty and retention, (iii) driving maximum revenue (iv) using data to deepen our understanding of guest interests and buying behaviors and (v) increasing our digital marketing capabilities to efficiently reach our guests with relevant offerings. 
Intellectual Property
 Our business is affected by our ability to protect against infringement of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights and other proprietary rights. Important intellectual property includes rights in names, logos, character likenesses, theme park attractions, content of television programs and systems related to the study and care of certain of our animals. In addition, we are party to key license agreements as licensee, including our agreements with Sesame Workshop and ABI as discussed below. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws of the United States and other countries, as well as contract provisions and third-party policies and procedures governing internet/domain name registrations.
Busch Gardens License Agreement
 Our subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC, is a party to a trademark license agreement with ABI, which governs our use of the Busch Gardens name and logo. Under the license agreement, ABI granted to us a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of our theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks.
 The license extends to our Busch Gardens theme parks located in Williamsburg, Virginia and Tampa, Florida, and may also include any amusement or theme park anywhere in the world that we acquire, build or rebrand with the Busch Gardens name in the future, subject to certain conditions. ABI may not assign, transfer or sell the Busch Gardens mark without first granting us a reasonable right of first refusal to purchase such mark.
 We have agreed to indemnify ABI from and against third party claims and losses arising out of or in connection with the operation of the theme parks and the related marketing or promotion thereof, any merchandise branded with the licensed marks and the infringement of a third party’s intellectual property. We are required to carry certain insurance coverage throughout the term of the license.
 The license agreement can be terminated by ABI under certain limited circumstances, including in connection with certain types of change of control of SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC.

Sesame License Agreement
 Our wholly-owned subsidiary, SEA, is a party to a license agreement with Sesame, a New York not-for-profit corporation. The License Agreement extends SEA’s status as Sesame’s exclusive theme park partner in the Sesame Territory (United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands), with the second Sesame Place® theme park scheduled to open no later than mid-2021. After the opening of the second Sesame Place, the Company will have the option to build additional Sesame Place theme parks in the Sesame Territory. 
 Under the terms of the license agreement, including the requirement for certain subsequent approvals from Sesame, Sesame granted SEA the right to use the Sesame Street Elements (as defined below) (a) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Place theme park, located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (the “Langhorne Sesame Place”) and additional Sesame Place theme parks in the United States (collectively, the “Standalone Parks”); (b) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Lands (currently known as Sesame Street® Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Antonio, Sesame Street Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Diego, Sesame Street Safari of Fun at Busch Gardens Tampa, and Sesame Street Forest of Fun at Busch Gardens Williamsburg) and additional Sesame Lands, including a Sesame Land at SeaWorld Orlando scheduled to be built by fall 2022 (collectively, the “Sesame Lands”); (c) in connection with the Licensed Products (as defined below); (d) in marketing and promotional activities related to the Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands, including without limitation, marketing, advertising and promotion, character appearances and live presentations (both in park and in off-site promotional activities such as schools, parades, conventions, etc.), and the Licensed Products; and/or (e) to seek and to enter into sponsorship agreements for specific sponsorships of Sesame Street-themed attractions. 
 In addition, SEA has been granted a license to (i) develop and manufacture or have developed and manufactured products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements or to purchase products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements from Sesame’s third party licensees (collectively, the “Licensed Products”), (ii) to market, promote, advertise, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within each of SEA’s theme parks and through online stores on SEA’s websites and targeted primarily to consumers in the United States and (iii) to contract with third party vendors to promote, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within the United States. 
 The term “Sesame Street Elements” means all current and hereafter developed or owned titles, marks, names, characters (including any new Sesame Street characters shown on Sesame Street and owned in whole or controlled by Sesame), images, likenesses, audio, video, audiovisual, logos, themes, symbols, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, visual representations and designs, and other intellectual property (whether in two- or three-dimensional form and including animated and mechanical representations) owned or controlled by Sesame (or its affiliates), and associated with the “Sesame Street” television property, whether previously (unless retired) or currently on “Sesame Street” or whether hereafter developed or owned and the names and marks “Sesame Place” and “Sesame Land,” but expressly excluding “Kermit the Frog.” 
 Sesame has reserved rights to build family entertainment centers using the Sesame Street Elements subject to certain territorial restrictions surrounding SEA’s Sesame Place Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands within the Sesame Territory. 
 The license agreement has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15 year extension plus a 5 year option added from each new Standalone Park opening. 
 Pursuant to the license agreement, SEA pays a specified annual license fee, as well as a specified royalty based on revenues earned in connection with sales of Licensed Products, all food and beverage items utilizing the licensed elements and any events utilizing such elements if a separate fee is paid for such event. 
 Our Industry
 We believe that the theme park industry is an attractive sector characterized by a proven business model that generates significant cash flow and has avenues for growth. Theme parks offer a strong consumer value proposition, particularly when compared to other forms of out-of-home entertainment such as concerts, sporting events, cruises and movies. As a result, theme parks attract a broad range of guests and generally exhibit strong operating margin across regions, operators, park types and macroeconomic conditions.
 According to the IBISWorld Report, the U.S. amusement park industry is comprised of a large number of venues ranging from a small group of high attendance, heavily themed destination theme parks to a large group of lower attendance local theme parks and family entertainment centers. According to the TEA/AECOM Report, the United States is the largest theme park market in the world with 5 of the 10 largest theme park groups worldwide and 10 of the 25 most-visited theme parks in the world. In 2017, the U.S. amusement park industry was expected to generate approximately $17.7 billion in revenues and grow annually by 2% from 2017-2022, according to the IBISWorld Report.

Competition
 Our theme parks and other product and entertainment offerings compete directly for discretionary spending with other destination and regional theme parks and water and amusement parks and indirectly with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Studios, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, Merlin Entertainments and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. Our highly differentiated products provide a value proposition and a complementary experience to those offered by fantasy-themed Disney and Universal parks. In addition, we benefit from the significant capital investments made in developing the tourism industry in the Orlando area. The Orlando theme park market is extremely competitive, with a high concentration of theme parks operated by several companies.
 Competition is based on multiple factors including location, price, the originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), and availability and cost of transportation to a theme park. We believe we can compete effectively, due to our strong brand recognition, unique and extensive zoological collection, targeted capital investments and valuable real estate. Additionally, we believe that our theme parks feature a sufficient quality and variety of rides and attractions, educational and interactive experiences, merchandise locations, restaurants and family orientation to make them highly competitive with other destination and regional theme parks, as well as other forms of entertainment.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 4,900 full-time employees and approximately 11,300 part-time employees.  During our peak operating season in 2017, we employed approximately 5,000 seasonal employees, many of whom are high school and college students. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Regulatory
 Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances including, but not limited to, those regulating the environment, display, possession and care of our animals, amusement park rides, building and construction, health and safety, labor and employment, workplace safety, zoning and land use and alcoholic beverage and food service. Key statutes and treaties relating to the display, possession and care of our zoological collection include the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Animal Welfare Act, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Fauna Protection Act and the Lacey Act. We must also comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, Wild Bird Conservation Act and National Environmental Policy Act, among other laws and regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws, regulations and ordinances; however, such requirements may change over time, and there can be no assurance that new requirements, changes in enforcement policies or newly discovered conditions relating to our properties or operations will not require significant expenditures in the future.  For information on recent regulatory developments, see the “—Recent Developments—Regulatory Developments” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Insurance
 We maintain insurance of the type and in the amounts that we believe to be commercially reasonable for businesses in our industry. We maintain primary and excess casualty coverage of up to $125 million. As part of this coverage, we retain deductible/self-insured retention exposures of $1 million per occurrence for general liability claims, $250,000 per accident for automobile liability claims, and $750,000 per occurrence for workers compensation claims. We maintain employers’ liability and all coverage required by law in the states in which we operate. Defense costs are included in the insurance coverage we obtain against losses in these areas. Based upon our historical experience of reported claims and an estimate for incurred-but-not-reported claims, we accrue a liability for our deductible/self-insured retention contingencies regarding general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation exposures. We maintain additional forms of special casualty coverage appropriate for businesses in our industry. We also maintain commercial property coverage against fire, natural perils, so-called “extended coverage” perils such as civil commotion, business interruption and terrorism exposures for protection of our real and personal properties (other than land). We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. We cannot predict the amounts of premium cost that we may be required to pay for future insurance coverage, the level of any deductibles/self-insured retentions we may retain applicable thereto, the level of aggregate excess coverage available or the availability of coverage for special or specific risks.

Corporate History
 On December 1, 2009, investment funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. and certain co-investors, through SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc.
