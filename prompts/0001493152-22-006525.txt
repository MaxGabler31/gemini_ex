ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 
We are an ophthalmic-focused healthcare company. Our business specializes in the development, production and sale of innovative medications that offer unique competitive advantages and serve unmet needs in the marketplace through our subsidiaries and deconsolidated companies. We own and operate ImprimisRx, one of the nation’s leading ophthalmology-focused pharmaceutical businesses, and Visionology, Inc. (“Visionology”), a direct-to-consumer eyecare subsidiary focused on chronic vision care. In addition, we also have non-controlling equity positions in Surface Ophthalmics, Inc. (“Surface”) and Melt Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Melt”), both companies that began as subsidiaries of Harrow and were subsequently deconsolidated. We also own royalty rights in various drug candidates being developed by Surface and Melt.
 
ImprimisRx 
 
ImprimisRx is our ophthalmology-focused prescription pharmaceutical business. From its inception in 2014, ImprimisRx, whose business consists of integrated research and development, production, dispensing/distribution, sales, marketing, and customer-service capabilities, has offered physician customers and their patients access to critical medicines to meet their clinical needs. Initially, ImprimisRx focused exclusively on compounded medications to serve needs unmet by commercially available drugs. We make our formulations available at prices that are, in most cases, lower than non-customized commercial drugs, ImprimisRx’s customer base has grown to include more than 10,000 U.S. eyecare-dedicated prescribers and institutions. Our current ophthalmology formulary includes over 20 compounded formulations, many of which are patented or patent-pending, and are customizable for the specific needs of a patient. Our compounded medications include various combinations of drugs formulated into one bottle and numerous preservative free formulations. Depending on the formulation, the regulations of a specific state and ultimately the needs of the patient, ImprimisRx products may be dispensed as patient-specific medications from our 503A pharmacy, or for in-office use, made according to current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) or other guidance documents from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), in our FDA-registered New Jersey outsourcing facility. 
 
Over the past two years, in order to more fully serve the needs of our growing customer base, we have invested in broadening ImprimisRx’s product portfolio to include FDA-approved products. Our investments in this regard have led to commercial partnerships to sell DEXYCU® (“Dexycu”) and Avenova, the acquisition of two later stage drug candidates, and the recent acquisition of U.S. rights to four FDA-approved ophthalmic products. These transactions, and those we are continuing to pursue, are focused in eyecare pharmaceuticals. We believe that our continued investments in these and other products will enable us to provide more physician prescribers and their patients with access to a complete portfolio of affordable eyecare pharmaceuticals to address their clinical needs.

DEXYCU®
 
ImprimisRx entered into a Commercial Alliance Agreement (the “Dexycu Agreement”) with Eyepoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Eyepoint”), pursuant to which Eyepoint granted ImprimisRx the right to promote DEXYCU® (dexamethasone intraocular suspension) 9% for the treatment of post-operative inflammation following ocular surgery in the United States. Pursuant to the Dexycu Agreement, Eyepoint pays ImprimisRx a fee that is calculated based on the quarterly sales of Dexycu in the U.S.
IOPIDINE®, MAXITROL® EYE DROPS, MOXEZA®
 
In December 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “NVS Agreement”) with Novartis Technology, LLC and Novartis Ophthalmics AG (together, “NVS”), pursuant to which we acquired U.S. commercial rights to four FDA-approved ophthalmic medicines:

● | IOPIDINE 1% (apraclonidine hydrochloride) is indicated to control or prevent post-surgical elevations in intraocular pressure (IOP) that occur in patients after argon laser trabeculoplasty, argon laser iriodotomy or Nd:YAG posterior capsulotomy; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | IOPIDINE 0.5% (apraclonidine hydrochloride) is for short-term adjunctive therapy in patients on maximally tolerated medical therapy who require additional IOP reduction; 
● | MAXITROL (neomycin/polymyxin B/dexamethasone) is an eye drop used to treat steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions where bacterial infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists; and 
● | MOXEZA 0.5% (moxifloxacin hydrochloride) is a topical fluoroquinolone anti-infective eye drop used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis. 

 
Pursuant to the NVS Agreement, NVS will continue to sell the products and transfer the net profit to us for a transitional period of approximately six months after the date of execution. Following the transition period, we expect to have the products manufactured by third parties and commercialize the products for the U.S. market.
 
We believe by expanding our product portfolio to include these branded FDA-approved products, we will be positioned to leverage our ImprimisRx platform to introduce unique lifecycle management strategies that could grow sales and address needs of our customers that we are unable to meet with our other compounded product offerings.
 
AMP-100
 
In July 2021, we acquired the exclusive marketing and supply rights to AMP-100 in the U.S. and Canada from Sintetica S.A. (“Sintetica”). AMP-100 is a patented, ophthalmic topical anesthetic drug candidate. If FDA-approved, the active ingredient used in AMP-100 will be the first approved use of this active ingredient in the U.S. ophthalmic market.
 
The safety and efficacy of AMP-100 were evaluated in various clinical trials, including a Phase 2/3 randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, efficacy, safety and tolerability study in healthy volunteers and a non-inferiority Phase 3 study of 342 patients undergoing cataract surgeries, comparing AMP-100 to an active comparator. Ultimately, these studies demonstrated:
 

● | AMP-100 is generally well tolerated, and the most common adverse event was mydriasis (dilation of pupil) in about 20% of patients,; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | AMP-100 has similar onset of action and met the primary endpoint of a Phase 3 non-inferiority study comparing AMP-100 to an active control (Phase 3); 
● | Anesthesia success of patients receiving AMP-100 was 95% vs. 20% with placebo (Phase 2/3 study) and; 
● | AMP-100 has been shown to have predictable offset (end of anesthesia) within a narrow bell curve (i.e. no wide variance). 

 
A new drug application (“NDA”) for AMP-100 was submitted by Sintetica to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the FDA has assigned the application standard review and a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of October 16, 2022. If approved, we expect our initial commercial focus of AMP-100 to be on ophthalmic procedures that traditionally require the eye to be anesthetized.
 
AMP-100 is protected by one issued patent and another patent-pending. The issued patent includes composition of matter and method of use claims and could provide protection for AMP-100 into 2037.

MAQ-100
 
In August 2021, we acquired exclusive marketing rights to MAQ-100 in the U.S. and Canada from Wakamoto Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Wakamoto”). MAQ-100 is a preservative-free triamcinolone acetonide ophthalmic injection drug candidate. MAQ-100 is marketed and sold by Wakamoto in Japan as MaQaid®. Following Japan’s Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare (“MHLW”) approval, MaQaid was launched in Japan in 2010, indicated as an intravitreal injection for visualization for vitrectomy. Since its initial MHLW approval, the indication for MaQaid was expanded to include (a) treatments for alleviation of diabetic macular edema, (b) macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion (or RVO), and (c) non-infectious uveitis. We intend to leverage the clinical data used for Japanese market approval of MaQaid to support a clinical program and U.S. market NDA submission of MAQ-100 for visualization during vitrectomy. We intend to request a meeting with FDA during the first half of 2022 to discuss our planned clinical program for MAQ-100. 
 
We expect to acquire and/or develop additional FDA-approved/approvable ophthalmic products and product candidates that will allow us to leverage the commercial infrastructure of ImprimisRx to promote, sell, and ultimately bring these products to market.
 
Visionology 
 
Visionology, a direct-to-consumer online eye health platform, leverages our experience in the ophthalmic pharmaceutical business as well as our relationships with eyecare professionals across the United States. We recently launched a proof-of-concept model for Visionology within certain U.S. markets, and if successful, expect to expand the launch on a nationwide basis in 2022.
Ophthalmology Market
 
For any ocular procedure, a surgeon may require drugs for sedation, dilation, inflammation and infection prevention, and ocular surface preservation. The cataract surgery market continues to experience significant growth. According to Market Scope, approximately 4.2 million cataract surgeries were performed in the U.S. in 2019. The National Eye Institute estimates that over 24 million Americans currently have cataracts and that this number will grow to 38 million by 2030 and reach more than 50 million by 2050. In addition, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) estimates that over one-half of Americans require some form of vision correction and 43 million of these individuals are candidates for refractive surgery. Nearly 96 percent of the refractive surgery procedures performed are LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis) surgeries, an outpatient surgical procedure used to treat nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. According to Statista, an estimated 600,000 LASIK procedures were performed in the U.S. in 2015.
 
According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, there are over 3 million Americans with glaucoma but only half are aware they have it. Open-angle glaucoma (the most common type of glaucoma) is a condition of increased intraocular pressure that causes gradual loss of sight. Glaucoma is incurable, and if not managed, can lead to blindness. Generally, the first line of treatment consists of a prostaglandin analogue (PGA) eye drop regimen. As the disease progresses, non-PGA products are generally added as a second line treatment. Topical agents, other than PGAs, include beta blockers, alpha agonists, miotics and steroids. According to a 2013 article in Glaucoma Today, up to 50% of glaucoma patients require more than one drug following a few months of initial treatment and there is a direct correlation between the number of glaucoma bottles and decreased adherence; however, the FDA has yet to approve a PGA combination product despite combination products including a PGA (Xalacom®, DuoTrav® and Ganfort®) available outside of the U.S. According to a 2017 Market Scope report, the glaucoma pharmaceuticals market is expected to reach $5.3 billion in 2022.
 
Dry eye occurs when the eye does not produce enough tears, or when the tears are not of the correct consistency and evaporate too quickly. Inflammation of the surface of the eye may also occur. We believe that dry eye disease (“DED”) affects over 30 million people in the U.S., and a major epidemiological study, the Beaver Dam Offspring Study, published in 2014 in the American Journal of Ophthalmology, reported that in a cohort of over 3,000 patients, DED was self-reported by 14.5% of the patients. According to a 2017 Market Scope report, the global dry eye treatments market is expected to grow from $3.7 billion in 2017 to $4.9 billion in 2022. Dry eye is among the most common conditions seen by eyecare professionals.
 
Presbyopia is the normal loss of near focusing ability that occurs with age. Most people begin to notice the effects of presbyopia sometime after age 40, when they start having trouble seeing small print clearly. According to an American Academy of Ophthalmology report from 2018, there are an estimated 1.8 billion people worldwide who suffer from presbyopia, with eye glasses (more commonly referred to as “readers”) being the most common treatment option. Based on our understanding, there are currently four eyedrops undergoing clinical trials/development in the U.S. aiming to be first to market topical eye drops to treat the symptoms associated with presbyopia. We believe most of these are designed to enhance depth of field via a “pinhole effect” and in one case to reduce lens stiffening; and some of these medications could be synergistic with each other or combined with refractive surgery to enhance outcomes. However, as of the date of this Annual Report, none of these drug candidates has received market approval from the FDA.

Pharmaceutical Compounding Businesses 
 
Pharmaceutical Compounding 
 
Pharmaceutical compounding is the science of combining different active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), all of which are approved by the FDA (either as a finished form product or as a bulk drug ingredient), and excipients to create specialized pharmaceutical preparations. Physicians and healthcare institutions use compounded drugs when commercially available drugs do not optimally treat a patient’s needs. In many cases, compounded drugs, such as ours, have wide market utility and may be clinically appropriate for large patient populations. Examples of compounded formulations include medications with alternative dosage strengths or unique dosage forms, such as topical creams or gels, suspensions, or solutions with more tolerable drug delivery vehicles.
 
Almost all of our sales revenue is derived from making, selling and dispensing our compounded prescription drug formulations as cash pay transactions between us and our end-user customer. As such, the majority of our commercial transactions do not involve distributors, wholesalers, insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers or other middle parties. By not being reliant on insurance company formulary inclusion and pharmacy benefit manager payment clawbacks, we are able to simplify the prescription transaction process. We believe the outcome of our business model is a simple transaction, involving a patient-in-need, a physician’s diagnosis, a fair price and great service for a quality pharmaceutical product. We sell our products through a network of employees and independent contractors, and we dispense our formulations in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and in select markets outside the United States.
 
Our Compounding Facilities 
 
Pharmaceutical compounding businesses are governed by Sections 503A and 503B of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”). Section 503A of the FDCA provides that a pharmacy is only permitted to compound a drug for an individually identified patient based on a prescription for the patient and is only permitted to distribute the drug interstate if the pharmacy is licensed to do so in the states where it is compounded and where the medication is received. 
 
Section 503B of the FDCA provides that a pharmacy engaged in preparing sterile compounded drug formulations may voluntarily elect to register as an “outsourcing facility.” Outsourcing facilities are permitted to compound large quantities of drugs without a prescription and distribute them out of state with certain limitations, such as the formulation appearing on the FDA’s drug shortage list or the bulk drug substances contained in the formulations appearing on the FDA’s “clinical need” list. Entities voluntarily registering with FDA as outsourcing facilities are subject to additional requirements that do not apply to compounding pharmacies (operating under Section 503A of the FDCA), including adhering to standards such cGMPs or other FDA guidance documents and being subject to regular FDA inspection. 
 
We operate two compounding facilities located in Ledgewood, New Jersey. Our New Jersey operations are comprised of two separate entities and facilities, one of which is registered with the FDA as an outsourcing facility (“NJOF”) under Section 503B of the FDCA. The other New Jersey facility (“RxNJ”) is a licensed pharmacy operating under Section 503A of the FDCA. All products that we sell, produce and dispense are made in the United States. 
 
We believe that, with our current compounding pharmacy facilities and licenses and FDA registration of NJOF, we have the infrastructure to scale our business appropriately under the current regulatory landscape and meet the potential growth in demand we are targeting. We plan to invest in one or both of our facilities to further their capacity and efficiencies. Also, we may seek to access greater pharmacy and production related redundancy and markets through acquisitions, partnerships or other strategic transactions. 
 
Carved-Out Businesses (De-Consolidated Businesses)
 
We have ownership interests in Surface, Melt, and Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Eton”) and hold royalty interests in some of Surface’s and Melt’s drug candidates. These companies are pursuing market approval for their drug candidates under the FDCA, including in some instances under the abbreviated pathway described in Section 505(b)(2), which permits the submission of a NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.
 
In 2018 and 2019, we formed and created subsidiaries named Radley Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Radley”), Mayfield Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Mayfield”), and Stowe Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Stowe”). In 2020, we halted nearly all operating activities related to these subsidiaries to invest resources in other areas, and we may not restart any or all activities related to these businesses. In addition, we terminated license and acquisition agreements for Mayfield’s MAY-66 and MAY-44 drug candidates, and Stowe’s STE-006 drug candidate. 
 
Noncontrolling Equity Interests
 
Surface Ophthalmics, Inc. 
 
Surface is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics for ocular surface diseases.

In January 2021, Surface announced positive top-line results from a Phase 2 trial of its drug candidate SURF-201, a 0.2% betamethasone, preservative-free ophthalmic solution in the Klarity delivery vehicle for the treatment of post cataract surgery pain and inflammation. According to the Surface results, SURF-201 was dosed twice daily, met its primary endpoints of absence of inflammation at both Day 8 and Day 15 and was found to be safe and well-tolerated by the patient group. In addition, a secondary endpoint showed almost 90% of patients given SURF-201 were pain free at Day 15. SURF-201 marks the first ophthalmic therapeutic in the United States to utilize betamethasone and the first preservative-free unit dose therapy for the treatment of post-operative pain and inflammation.
 
Also in January 2021, Surface announced the first patient dosed in a head-to-head Phase 2 trial for its drug candidate SURF-100 (mycophenolate sodium and betamethasone in Klarity vehicle) for the treatment of chronic dry eye disease. The head-to-head study will compare SURF-100 against leading on-market competitors lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5% (marketed as Xiidra®) and cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% (marketed as Restasis®). 
 
In February 2021, Surface announced the first patient dosed in a Phase 2 trial for its drug candidate SURF-200 (betamethasone in Klarity vehicle) for the treatment of episodic dry eye flares. The dose ranging study for SURF-200 will be administered in two different low concentration formulations of betamethasone in the Klarity vehicle. The trial will enroll 120 to 140 patients with a primary endpoint of Symptom Improvement of one unit based on the University of North Carolina Dry Eye Management Scale by the eighth day.
 
In 2018, Surface closed an offering of its Series A Preferred Stock. At that time, we lost our controlling interest and deconsolidated Surface from our consolidated financial statements. During May, June and July of 2021, Surface closed an offering of its preferred stock at a purchase price of $4.50 per share resulting in gross proceeds to Surface of approximately $25,000,000 (the “Surface Series B Offering”). We own 3,500,000 shares of Surface common stock, which is approximately 20% of the equity and voting interests as of December 31, 2021. Harrow owns mid-single digit royalty rights on net sales of SURF-100, SURF-200 and SURF-201. 
 
Melt Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 
Melt is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary non-intravenous, sedation and anesthesia therapeutics for human medical procedures in hospital, outpatient, and in-office settings. Melt intends to seek regulatory approval for its proprietary technologies, where possible. In December 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Melt (the “Melt Asset Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which Harrow assigned to Melt the underlying intellectual property for Melt’s current pipeline, including its lead drug candidate MELT-300. The core intellectual property Melt owns is a patented series of combination non-opioid sedation drug formulations that we estimate to have multitudinous applications. 
 
MELT-300 is a novel, sublingually delivered, non-IV, opioid-free drug candidate being developed for procedural sedation. Melt filed an investigational new drug application (“IND”) with the FDA in June 2020 and began its clinical program for MELT-300. In February 2021, Melt announced data from, and the successful completion of, its Phase 1 study. Melt recently began enrolling patients in its Phase 2 study for MELT-300. 
 
In January 2019, Melt closed an offering of its Series A Preferred Stock. At that time, we lost our controlling interest and deconsolidated Melt from our consolidated financial statements. We own 3,500,000 shares of Melt common stock, which was approximately 46% of the equity and voting interests issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021. In September 2021, we provided Melt with a senior secured loan in the amount of $13,500,000, which is intended to fund the Phase 2 program of MELT-300. In connection with the loan, we also were provided the right, but not the obligation, to match any offer received by Melt associated with the commercial rights to any of its drug candidates for a period of five years. Melt is required to make mid-single digit royalty payments to the Company on net sales of MELT-300, while any patent rights remain outstanding, subject to other conditions. Melt can require the Company to cease compounding like products at the time of FDA approval of MELT-300. If approved, we do not expect a cessation of compounding like products to have a material impact on our operations and financial performance. 
 
Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 
Eton is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative drug products. Its pipeline includes several products and drug candidates in various stages of development across a variety of dosage forms. In May 2017, Eton closed an offering of its Series A Preferred Stock, as a result of which we gave up our controlling interest in it. In November 2018, Eton completed an initial public offering of its common stock. We own 1,982,000 shares of Eton common stock, which is less than 10% of Eton’s equity and voting interests issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021.
Sales and Marketing
 
The focus of our sales and marketing is in the U.S. We do, however, believe that our proprietary drug formulations, drug candidates and drug products could have commercial appeal in international markets, and in the past we have engaged distributors and entered into out-licensing arrangements for certain of our proprietary formulations in certain non-U.S. markets, including Canada. Our sales and marketing efforts are currently organized into two teams, the larger of which focuses on our ophthalmology pharmaceutical business and the other on our non-ophthalmology pharmaceutical compounding business. Our sales and marketing activities consist primarily of efforts to educate doctors, ambulatory surgery centers, healthcare systems, hospitals and other users throughout the U.S. about our compounded formulations. We expect that we may experience growth in the sales of our proprietary pharmaceutical compounded formulations in future periods, particularly in light of our current and planned launches of new formulations and commercialization campaigns. However, we may not be successful in doing so, whether due to the safety, quality or availability of our proprietary compounded formulations, the size of the markets for such formulations, which could be smaller than we expect, the timing of market entry relative to competitive products, the availability of alternative compounded formulations or FDA-approved drugs, the price of our compounded formulations relative to alternative products or the success of our sales and marketing efforts, which is dependent on our ability to build and grow a qualified and adequate internal sales function.

We expect to continue to acquire and/or develop additional FDA-approved ophthalmic drugs that allow us to leverage the commercial infrastructure of ImprimisRx to promote, sell, and ultimately bring these products to market. As we execute this strategy, we will likely expand our sales and marketing team, expertise and expenses. This would include the addition of market access expertise and team members, where roles include discussions with payors regarding the costs and benefits of our products for their members, assisting with the addition of our products to the medical policy of payors, and providing the market with assistance regarding reimbursement queries.
 
We have entered into various sales and marketing agreements with certain organizations to provide exclusive sales and marketing representation services to ImprimisRx in select geographies in the U.S., in connection with our pharmaceutical products and compounded formulations. Under the terms of the sales and marketing agreements, we are required to make commission payments, generally equal to 10% to 14% of net sales for products above and beyond the initial existing sales amounts. In addition, we are required to make periodic milestone payments to certain organizations in shares of our restricted common stock if net sales in the assigned territory reach certain future levels by the end of their terms, as applicable. We believe these sales and marketing agreements will continue to accelerate launches of our new ophthalmology programs and limit our initial capital requirements commonly associated with new product launches and increased sizes of sales forces.
 
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and pharmacy industries are highly competitive. We compete against branded drug companies, generic drug companies, outsourcing facilities and other compounding pharmacies. We are significantly smaller than some of our competitors, and we may lack the financial and other resources needed to develop, produce, distribute, market and commercialize any of our proprietary formulations or compete for market share in these sectors. The drug products available through branded and generic drug companies with which our formulations compete have been approved for marketing and sale by the FDA and are required to be manufactured in facilities compliant with cGMP standards. Although we prepare some of our compounded formulations in accordance with cGMP standards and our other formulations are produced according to the standards provided by United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) <795> and USP <797> and applicable state and federal law, our proprietary compounded formulations are not required to be, and have not been, approved for marketing and sale by the FDA. As a result, some physicians may be unwilling to prescribe, and some patients may be unwilling to use, our formulations. Additionally, under federal and state laws applicable to our current compounding pharmacy operations operating under Section 503A of the FDCA, we are not permitted to prepare significant amounts of a specific formulation in advance of a prescription, compound quantities for office use or utilize a wholesaler for distribution of our formulations; instead, our compounded formulations must be prepared and dispensed in connection with a physician prescription for an individually identified patient. Pharmaceutical companies, on the other hand, are able to sell their FDA-approved products to large pharmaceutical wholesalers, who can in turn sell to and supply hospitals and retail pharmacies. Even though we have registered NJOF with the FDA, our business may not be scalable on the scope available to our competitors that produce FDA-approved drugs, which may limit our potential for profitable operations. These facets of our operations may subject our business to limitations our competitors offering FDA-approved drugs may not face.
 
Biotechnology and related pharmaceutical technologies are subject to rapid and significant change. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Products developed by our competitors, including FDA-approved drugs and compounded formulations created by other pharmacies, could render our products and technologies obsolete or unable to compete. Any products that we develop may become obsolete before we recover expenses incurred in developing the products, which may require that we seek additional funds that may or may not be available to continue our operations. The competitive environment requires an ongoing, extensive search for medical and technological innovations and the ability to develop and market these innovations effectively, and we may not be competitive with respect to these factors. Other competitive factors include the safety and efficacy of a product, the size of the market for a product, the timing of market entry relative to competitive products, the availability of alternative compounded formulations or approved drugs, the price of a product relative to alternative products, the availability of third-party reimbursement, the success of sales and marketing efforts, brand recognition and the availability of scientific and technical information about a product. Although we believe we are positioned to compete favorably with respect to many of these factors, if our proprietary formulations are unable to compete with the products of our competitors, we may never gain market share or achieve profitability.
 
Factors Affecting Our Performance
 
We believe the primary factors affecting our performance are our ability to increase revenues of our proprietary compounded formulations and certain non-proprietary products, grow and gain operating efficiencies in our pharmacy operations, potential regulatory-related restrictions, optimize pricing and obtain reimbursement options for our proprietary compounded formulations, and continue to pursue development and commercialization opportunities for certain of our ophthalmology and other assets that we have not yet made commercially available as compounded formulations. We believe we have built a tangible and intangible infrastructure that will allow us to scale revenues efficiently in the near and long-term. All of these activities will require significant costs and other resources, which we may not have or be able to obtain from operations or other sources. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.

Reimbursement Options 
 
Dexycu is covered under Medicare Part B, and we are developing drug candidates that we believe will be covered under Medicare Part B. New drugs approved by the FDA that are used in surgeries performed in hospital outpatient departments or ambulatory surgical centers may receive a transitional pass-through reimbursement under Medicare, provided they meet certain criteria, including a “not insignificant” cost criterion. Pass-through status allows for separate payment (i.e., outside the packaged payment rate for the surgical procedure) under Medicare Part B, which consists of Medicare reimbursement for a drug based on a defined formula for calculating the minimum fee that a manufacturer may charge for the drug. Under current regulations of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), pass-through status applies for a period of three years, measured from the date Medicare makes its first pass-through payment for the product, following which the product would be incorporated into the cataract bundled payment system, which could significantly reduce the pricing for that product. Following expiration of pass-through status, under current CMS policy, non-opioid pain management surgical drugs when used on Medicare Part B patients in the ASC setting can qualify for ongoing separate payment. CMS’ current non-opioid separate payment policy, like other CMS policies, can be changed by CMS through its annual rulemaking and comment process. We believe that CMS will continue its separate payment policy for non-opioid pain management surgical drugs, which has been in effect since 2019.
 
We are working with outside consultants to potentially gain an extension to the transitional payment system, or to separate the drug payment from the bundled cataract surgery payment after the three-year transitional payment ends and continue to be reimbursed separately for a longer period of time, potentially through patent life. Unless extended, Dexycu transitional pass-through reimbursement status will expire on December 31, 2022, which will have an adverse impact on our commission revenues from this product.
 
Our proprietary ophthalmic compounded formulations are currently primarily available on a cash-pay basis. However, MOXEZA, MAXITROL and IOPIDINE, are and we expect that other drug candidates we are developing, if approved, will be eligible for reimbursement by third-party payors. We may devote time and other resources to seek reimbursement and patient pay opportunities for these and other drug products and candidates. However, we may be unsuccessful in achieving these goals, as many third-party payors have imposed significant challenges for products to be eligible for reimbursement in recent years. Moreover, third-party payors, including Medicare, are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and, in some cases, by refusing to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted labeling approval. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Care Reform Law”), may have a considerable impact on the existing U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care and could conceivably have a material adverse effect on our business. As a result, reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors may never be available for any of our products or, if available, may not be sufficient to allow us to sell the products on a competitive basis and at desirable price points. We are communicating with government and third-party payors in order to make our drug products and candidates available to more patients and at optimized pricing levels. However, if government and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our drug products and candidates, the market acceptance and opportunity for them may be limited.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success and ability to compete depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. We conduct a fulsome analysis of the intellectual property landscape prior to acquiring rights to formulations and filing patent applications. In addition, as of March 1, 2022, we owned and/or licensed 117 total issued and pending patent applications, which includes 18 U.S. issued patents, 11 international issued patents, and 88 U.S. and foreign/international patent pending applications. We expect to file additional patent applications in the U.S. and pursue patent protection for certain of our formulations in other important international jurisdictions in the future.
 
As of March 1, 2022, we had, on a worldwide basis, 162 issued trademarks, pending trademark and copyright applications, or registered copyright and/or trademarks including, but not limited to: Imprimis®, ImprimisRx®, Harrow Health®, Dropless®, LessDrops®, Dropless Cataract Surgery®, Dropless Cataract Therapy®, Dropless Therapy®, MKO Melt®, and Simple Drops®. We may choose to pursue trademark protection in other jurisdictions for any one or more of these or other marks in the future.
 
We also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation in order to develop our formulations, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and others, including certain service providers. We also have invention or patent assignment agreements with our current employees and certain consultants. However, our employees and consultants may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. In addition, inventions relevant to us could be developed by a person not bound by an invention assignment agreement with us, in which case we may have no rights to use the applicable invention.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices, including, among others: federal, state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”); the Health Care Reform Law; statutes and regulations of the FDA, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable state agencies concerning the sale, advertisement and promotion of the products we sell. The regulatory and quality compliance environment for compounded drugs has become significantly more rigorous, complex and strict since the passage of The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013. The complexity of the current state and federal regulatory environment, as well as the expected continued evolution of state and federal laws governing pharmaceutical compounding, have and will continue to present potentially significant challenges to our business model and the fulfillment of our mission as a company. Below are descriptions of some of the various federal and state laws and regulations which may govern or impact our current and planned operations.

FDA New Drug Application Process
 
As discussed in other sections of this Annual Report, we are pursing, and may continue to pursue, alone or with project partners, FDA approval to market and sell one or more of our formulations through the FDA’s NDA process. As a condition of approval, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require further studies, including Phase 4 post-marketing studies, to provide additional data. Other post-marketing studies may be required to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which the product was initially tested and approved. Also, the FDA or other regulatory authorities require post-marketing reporting to monitor the adverse effects of a drug. Results of post-marketing programs may limit or expand the further marketing of a product.
 
The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, fines and potential civil and criminal penalties.
 
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 
As an alternate path for FDA approval of new indications or new formulations of previously-approved products, a company may file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA instead of a “stand-alone” or “full” NDA. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Some examples of products that may be allowed to follow a Section 505(b)(2) path to approval are drugs that have a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication. The AMP-100 NDA that was submitted and we expect the MAQ-100 NDA will be submitted as Section 505(b)(2) NDAs.
 
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit the applicant to rely upon certain published nonclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product or the FDA’s conclusions from prior review of such studies. The FDA may require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the labeled indications for which the reference product has been approved, as well as for any new indication supported by the Section 505(b)(2) application. While references to nonclinical and clinical data not generated by the applicant or for which the applicant does not have a right of reference are allowed, all development, process, stability, qualification and validation data related to the manufacturing and quality of the new product must be included in an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2).
 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s conclusions regarding studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference product has expired. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its products only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its products may be commercialized.
 
Pharmacy Regulation
 
Our pharmacy operations are regulated by both individual states and the federal government. Every state has laws and regulations addressing pharmacy operations, including regulations relating specifically to compounding pharmacy operations. These regulations generally include licensing requirements for pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacies, as well as regulations related to compounding processes, safety protocols, purity, sterility, storage, controlled substances, recordkeeping and regular inspections, among other things. State rules and regulations are updated periodically, generally under the jurisdiction of individual state boards of pharmacy. Failure to comply with the state pharmacy regulations of a particular state could result in a pharmacy being prohibited from operating in that state, financial penalties and/or becoming subject to additional oversight from that state’s board of pharmacy. In addition, many states are considering imposing, or have already begun to impose, more stringent requirements on compounding pharmacies. If our pharmacy operations become subject to additional licensure requirements, are unable to maintain their required licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on pharmacies, our ability to operate in some states could be limited.

Federal law limits compounding pharmacies from engaging in the practice of anticipatory compounding, which involves preparing compounded medications before the actual receipt of a prescription or practitioner’s order, unless the compounding pharmacy has a history of filling certain prescriptions for a customer. In such cases, it is acceptable to engage in anticipatory compounding or the preparation of larger batches so that medications will be ready when they are needed. Anticipatory compounding also reduces the cost of compounded medications, as economies of scale can be realized by producing larger batches. Anticipatory compounding also leads to less wasted chemicals, dilutions, fillers, and other associated products that are produced, and greater accuracy and uniformity in finished medications, as larger batches decrease the variation caused by preparing multiple, smaller batches. Based on our history of meeting the needs of our customers, we are able to anticipatorily compound batches of our formulations for our customers, per the applicable regulations.
 
Many of the states into which we deliver pharmaceuticals have laws and regulations that require out-of-state pharmacies to register with, or be licensed by, the boards of pharmacy or similar regulatory bodies in those states. These states generally permit the dispensing pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the dispensing pharmacy is located. However, various state pharmacy boards have enacted laws and/or adopted rules or regulations directed at restricting or prohibiting the operation of out-of-state pharmacies by, among other things, requiring compliance with all laws of the states into which the out-of-state pharmacy dispenses medications, whether or not those laws conflict with the laws of the state in which the pharmacy is located, or requiring the pharmacist-in-charge to be licensed in that state. To the extent that such laws or regulations are found to be applicable to our operations, we believe we comply with them.
 
Further, under federal law, Section 503A of the FDCA previously had language that implied a limitation of the amount of compounded products that a pharmacy can distribute interstate. The interpretation and enforcement of this provision is dependent on the FDA entering into a standard Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with each state setting forth limits on shipments of interstate compounding. In January of 2019, the FDA released the “2018 Compounding Policy Priorities Plan” (the “2018 Compounding Plan”) which provided an overview of the key priorities the FDA planned to focus on in 2018 in connection with compounding regulations. One of the priorities outlined in the 2018 Compounding Plan addressed the FDA’s plan to release a revised MOU (the “Revised MOU”). Pursuant to the statements in the 2018 Compounding Plan, the Revised MOU would consider amounts shipped interstate by a compounder to be inordinate amounts if the “number of prescriptions of compounded drugs distributed interstate during any calendar month is greater than 50 percent.” Importantly, instead of that number serving as a “hard limit, for state action,” the 50% target would trigger certain additional reporting requirements. On October 27, 2020, the FDA announced availability of a final MOU, Addressing Certain Distributions of Compounded Human Drug Products Between the State Board of Pharmacy or Other Appropriate State Agency and the Food and Drug Administration (the “Final MOU”). The Final MOU describes the responsibilities of a state board of pharmacy, or other appropriate state agency that chooses to sign the Final MOU, in investigating and responding to complaints related to drug products compounded in such state and distributed outside such state and in addressing the interstate distribution of inordinate amounts of compounded human drug products. Additionally, as part of the Final MOU, the FDA refined the definition of “inordinate amount,” a threshold for certain information identification and sharing which does not place a limit on the distribution of compounded human drug products interstate by a pharmacy located in a state that has entered into the Final MOU. Section 503A of the FDCA sets a 5% limit on compounded drugs distributed outside the state by a pharmacist, pharmacy or physician located in a state that has not entered into the Final MOU. States have 365 days to sign the Final MOU, before the FDA intends to enforce the 5% limit described in Section 503A of the FDCA in states that have not signed the Final MOU. Our pharmacy is based in the state of New Jersey, and based on feedback we have received from the state board of pharmacy in New Jersey, we believe the state board of pharmacy in New Jersey will sign the Final MOU and as a result, our operations will not be materially affected by the Final MOU. In the event New Jersey does not sign the Final MOU, our pharmacy that operates under Section 503A may be materially affected and we will transition as many prescription orders as possible to our outsourcing facility, which is not subject to the Final MOU.
 
In February 2022, the FDA said it would suspend implementation of the Final MOU and engage in a formal rulemaking process. During the rulemaking process, the agency will not enter into new agreements with states based on the Final MOU. The FDA does not expect states that have signed the Final MOU to carry out the activities described in the Final MOU. Thus, there is no reporting requirement for any pharmacy concerning interstate shipments pursuant to Section 503A and will not be until the Final MOU is finalized through the rulemaking process, which will include the engagement of a notice-and-comment and rulemaking period to implement certain provisions of Section 503A. The agency indicated that the process may take “several years” to complete. In the same announcement, the FDA stated it does not intend to enforce the statutory 5% limit on the distribution of compounded drugs out of the state in which they are compounded by compounders located in states that do not sign the Final MOU for the duration of the rulemaking process.
 
Certain provisions of the FDCA govern the preparation, handling, storage, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (the “DQSA”) clarifies and strengthens the federal regulatory framework governing compounding pharmacies. Title 1 of the DQSA, the Compounding Quality Act, modifies provisions of the Section 503A of the FDCA that were found to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002. In general, Section 503A provides that pharmacies are exempt from the provisions of the FDCA requiring compliance with cGMP, labeling with adequate directions for use and FDA approval prior to marketing if the pharmacy complies with certain other requirements. Among other things, to comply with Section 503A, a compounded drug must be compounded by a licensed pharmacist for an identified individual patient on the basis of a valid prescription. Pharmacies may only compound in limited quantities before receipt of a prescription for an individual patient and are subject to limitations on anticipatory compounding for distribution, which generally permit anticipatory compounding only based on historical prescription volumes.

The DQSA also contained new Section 503B of the FDCA, which established an outsourcing facility as a new form of entity that is permitted to compound larger quantities of drug formulations without a prescription, thus permitting the practice of anticipatory compounding, and distributing them out of state without limitation, if the drug formulations appear on the FDA’s drug shortage list or the bulk drug substances contained in the formulations appear on a “clinical need” list to be established by the FDA. In January 2017, the FDA issued Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503B of the FFDCA (“Interim Policy”) that informs stakeholders about how the FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion for compounding with those substances on a “Category 1 list” while the agency compiles and evaluates its clinical needs list, as well as in March 2019 the FDA issued Evaluation of Bulk Substances Nominated for Use in Compounding Under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act which provides further guidance as to the FDA’s policy for evaluating bulk drug substances nominated for use in compounding by outsourcing facilities. Entities voluntarily registering as outsourcing facilities are subject to cGMP requirements and regular FDA inspection, among other requirements. As described above, our current pharmacy operations in NJ are governed by Section 503A of the FDCA, and our New Jersey based outsourcing facility is governed by Section 503B of the FDCA.
 
On July 30, 2020, the FDA issued a notice for comments related to certain bulk drug substances to be removed from the 503B Bulk’s List (or Category 1 List). Included in this notice for comment were certain bulk drug substances which we currently use in some of our compounded products. In the event one or more of these bulk substances are ultimately removed from the Category 1 List, we intend to utilize commercially available versions of these substances or similar active pharmaceutical ingredients as replacements of the bulk powders contained in our sterile products. In addition, nothing in the FDA’s notice affects the dispensing of bulk powder-containing products from our 503A pharmacy. Nonetheless, if all or some of the bulk drug substances we use are removed from the 503B Bulk’s List, this may result in a disruption in our operations, revenues and cash flows. In addition, during September 2020 through January 2021, NJOF was inspected by the FDA (the “2020 Inspection”) and certain observations were made by FDA in a Form 483. Five observations made during the 2020 Inspection were considered repeat observations from a 2017 FDA inspection of NJOF. In addition, during the 2020 Inspection, the FDA noted that we were compounding drugs for which there is no change that produces for an individual patient a clinical difference, as determined by a prescribing practitioner, between a compounded drug and the comparable approved drug. We have responded to the FDA regarding all of their observations from the 2020 Inspection, including providing documentation from prescribing clinicians that indicate a clinical difference between our compounded drugs and the comparable approved drugs, while also committing to amend our order process to collect “medical necessity/clinical difference” information for each order of our compounded drugs on a go-forward basis.
 
In two recent California federal court decisions, Allergan USA, Inc. v. Prescribers Choice, Inc. and Allergan USA, Inc. v. Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Court made rulings which impact 503B and 503A facilities operating in and shipping to the state of California. In the Prescribers Choice case, the Court determined that while the FDA’s interim policies do not override the statutory obligations of the DQSA, the Court supported the FDA’s authority and flexibility as it determines what clinical needs exist and finalizes the bulk drug substances list. The Court would not hold a party liable under California’s Sherman Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law (“Sherman Law”) for selling, delivering, or giving away any new drug that has not been approved by the California Department of Health Services or FDA if that party has complied with the FDA’s Interim Policy. In other words, it is not unlawful in California to utilize bulk drugs appearing on the Category 1 list while the FDA finalizes its clinical needs list. In the Imprimis Pharmaceuticals case, the Court made clear that its rulings related to violations of California’s Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”) (Cal. Bus. Prof. Code §17200) were limited in geographical scope to drugs prepared in, dispensed from within or shipped to the State of California. With respect to 503A facilities, the Court followed FDA’s guidance allowing compounding pharmacies to ship more than 5% of its medications out of state while finalizing the MOUs. It further held that 503A facilities operating within or shipping into the state of California must follow statutory guidance found in 21 U.S.C. 353(a). With respect to the statutory guidance related to compounding in response to valid prescription orders, the Court added a requirement that the valid prescription order must contain language that “an FDA-approved drug is not medically appropriate.” The practical effect of these two rulings is that 503A and 503B facilities operating within or shipping drugs into the State of California now have clear guidance as to what is, and is not, lawful behavior with respect the California’s UCL and Sherman Law.
 
We prepare our compounded formulations in accordance with the standards provided by the USP <795> and USP <797> and applicable state and federal law. In September 2021, USP announced proposed revisions to USP <795> and <797> for public comment. The proposed revisions include limitations on, among others, beyond use dating of sterile and preservative-free products and on batch sizes. After a comment and review period, we expect USP to announce the final revisions to USP guidelines in 2022 or 2023 with an effective date some time in 2023 or 2024. If adopted as originally proposed, the proposed revisions to USP <797> would likely have a negative impact on revenues generated from our 503A compounding pharmacy and limit the number of products we could sell from our 503A pharmacy.

Confidentiality, Privacy and HIPAA
 
Our pharmacy operations involve the receipt, use and disclosure of confidential medical, pharmacy and other health-related information. In addition, we use aggregated and blinded (anonymous) data for research and analysis purposes. The federal privacy regulations under HIPAA are designed to protect the medical information of a healthcare patient or health plan enrollee that could be used to identify the individual. Among other things, HIPAA limits certain uses and disclosures of protected health information and requires compliance with federal security regulations regarding the storage, utilization and transmission of and access to electronic protected health information. The requirements imposed by HIPAA are extensive. In addition, most states and certain other countries have enacted privacy and security laws that protect identifiable patient information that is not health-related. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) that creates new individual privacy rights for consumers and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. Effective January 1, 2020, the CCPA gives California residents expanded privacy rights and protections, and provides civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. The CCPA will likely impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the European Union (the “EU”) that became effective in May 2018 and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act that became effective in Canada in April 2000. Further, several states have enacted more protective and comprehensive pharmacy-related privacy legislation that not only applies to patient records but also prohibits the transfer or use for commercial purposes of pharmacy data that identifies prescribers. These regulations impose substantial requirements on covered entities and their business associates regarding the storage, utilization and transmission of and access to personal health and non-health information. Many of these laws apply to our business.
 
Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement
 
Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance coverage for qualified persons age 65 or older and for some disabled persons with certain specific conditions. State-funded Medicaid programs provide medical benefits to groups of low-income and disabled individuals, some of whom may have inadequate or no medical insurance. Currently, most of our compounded formulations are sold in cash transactions, and the customers decide whether or not to seek reimbursement opportunities from Medicare, Medicaid and other third parties. We work with third-party insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and buying groups to offer patient-specific customizable compounded formulations at accessible prices. We plan to continue to devote time and other resources to seek reimbursement and patient pay opportunities for these and other compounded formulations, and we have hired pharmacy billers to process certain existing reimbursement opportunities for certain formulations. Moreover, third-party payors, including Medicare, are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and by refusing, in some cases, to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted labeling approval. Further, the Health Care Reform Law may have a considerable impact on the existing U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care and could conceivably have a material effect on our business. As a result, reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors may never be available for any of our products or, if available, may not be sufficient to allow us to sell the products on a competitive basis and at desirable price points.
 
To the extent we obtain third-party reimbursement for our drug products, drug candidates, and compounded formulations, we may become subject to Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plan regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims.
 
International Regulation
 
If we pursue commercialization of our proprietary formulations in countries other than the United States, then we may need to obtain the approvals required by the regulatory authorities of such foreign countries that are comparable to the FDA and state boards of pharmacy, and we would be subject to a variety of other foreign statutes and regulations comparable to those relating to our U.S. operations. Regulatory frameworks and requirements vary by country and could involve significant additional licensing requirements and product testing and review periods.
Environmental and Other Matters
 
We are or may become subject to environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, any use and disposal by us of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research and preparation of our formulations. In addition, we are subject to work safety and labor laws that govern certain of our operations and our employee relations. In each of these areas, as described above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, licenses or permits, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
COVID-19 Pandemic 
 
The pandemic caused by an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, or the COVID-19 pandemic, that is affecting the U.S. and global economy and financial markets and the related responses of government, businesses and individuals are impacting our employees, patients, communities and business operations. The implementation of travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place/stay-at-home and social distancing orders and shutdowns, for example, affected our business in 2020 and 2021. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition and those of our customers, vendors, suppliers, and collaboration partners will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. Management continues to actively monitor this situation and the possible effects on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce. In the paragraphs that follow, we have described impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical development programs. For additional information on risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, please see “Item 1A — Risk Factors,” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Research and Development Expenses
 
Our research and development (“R&D”) expenses incurred in 2021 and 2020 primarily include expenses related to the upfront and milestone payments from the acquisition and licensing of technology for drug and product candidates that are not yet approved by the FDA (acquired in-process R&D), development of intellectual property, researcher and investigator-initiated evaluations, and formulation development related primarily to our ophthalmic formulations and certain other assets, in addition to costs associated with our drug candidate development programs.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred $11,084,000 in R&D expenses, compared to $2,413,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is related to milestone payments and the $8,117,000 payment to Sintetica related to our acquisition of rights to AMP-100 along with increased costs associated with the clinical program for MAQ-100.
 
Financial Information About Segments and Geographic Areas
 
Management evaluated the Company’s 2021 performance based on operating segments. Segment performance for its two operating segments was based on segment contribution. Our reportable segments consisted of (i) our commercial stage pharmaceutical business (Pharmaceutical Compounding), generally including the operations of our ImprimisRx business; and (ii) our start-up operations associated with our pharmaceutical drug development business (Pharmaceutical Drug Development). Segment contribution for our segments represented net revenues less cost of sales, R&D expenses, selling and marketing expenses, and select general and administrative expenses. Management did not evaluate the following items at the segment level:

● | Operating expenses within selling, general and administrative expenses that result from the impact of corporate initiatives. Corporate initiatives primarily include integration, restructuring, acquisition and other shared costs; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Selling, general and administrative expenses that result from shared infrastructure, including certain expenses associated with legal matters, our board of directors and principal executive officers, investor relations and other like shared expenses; 
● | Other select revenues and operating expenses including R&D expenses, amortization, and asset sales and impairments, net as not all such information has been accounted for at the segment level, or such information has not been used by both segments; and 
● | Total assets including capital expenditures. 

 
Management defined segment net revenues as pharmaceutical compounded drug sales, revenues from licenses and other revenues derived from related agreements.
 
Cost of sales within segment contribution includes direct and indirect costs to manufacture formulations and sell products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, personnel costs, packaging, storage, royalties, shipping and handling costs, manufacturing equipment and tenant improvements depreciation, the write-off of obsolete inventory and other related expenses.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses consisted mainly of personnel-related costs, marketing and promotion costs, distribution costs, professional service costs, insurance, depreciation, facilities costs, transaction costs, and professional services costs, which are general in nature and attributable to the segment.
 
Beginning in 2022, due to shifts in the Company’s strategic plans to further focus on growing the Company’s ImprimisRx business and suspension of activities related to starting up development-stage pharmaceutical companies, along with changes to the Company’s organizational and internal reporting structure, management will no longer evaluate the Company’s business in two segments and will instead focus on the performance of the business as a single operating business.
 
See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information about our reportable segments.
 
Human Capital
 
As of March 1, 2022, we employed 182 employees. Our employees are engaged in pharmacy operations, sales, marketing, research, development, and general and administrative functions. We expect to add additional employees in all departmental functions as we carry out our business plan in the next 12 months. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements with any of our employees. We have never experienced a work stoppage, and we believe our employee relations are good. We hire independent contractors and consultants on an as-needed basis, and our salesforce is comprised primarily of contract sales organizations and contract labor.

Talent Acquisition and Retention
 
We recognize that our employees largely contribute to our success. To this end, we support business growth by seeking to attract and retain best-in-class talent. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled candidates in the U.S.. We believe that we continue to attract and retain superior talent as measured by our turnover rate and employee service tenure.
Total Rewards
 
Our total rewards philosophy has been to create investment in our workforce by offering competitive compensation and benefits packages. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary, annual incentive bonuses, and long-term equity awards. We also offer comprehensive employee benefits, which vary by country and region, such as life, disability, and health insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, and a 401(k) plan. It is our expressed intent to be an employer of choice in our industry by providing market-competitive compensation and benefits packages.
Health, Safety, and Wellness
 
The health, safety, and wellness of our employees is a priority in which we have always invested and will continue to do so. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. Program benefits are intended to provide protection and security, so employees can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that may impact their financial well-being.
 
These investments and the prioritization of employee health, safety, and wellness took on particular significance in 2020 and 2021 in light of COVID-19. To protect and support our essential team members, we have implemented health and safety measures that included maximizing personal workspaces, changing shift schedules, providing personal protective equipment (PPE), and instituting screening before accessing buildings. In response to local stay-at-home orders and in alignment with CDC recommendations, we have limited our employees onsite in our office location based in California. To aid in containing the spread of COVID-19, we have implemented remote-work options when appropriate and are limiting employee travel. We are monitoring this rapidly evolving situation and will continue to seek programs to educate and assist employees whenever possible.
 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
 
We believe a diverse workforce is critical to our success. Our mission is to value differences in races, ethnicities, religions, nationalities, genders, ages, sexual orientations, as well as education, skill sets and experience. We are focused on inclusive hiring practices, fair and equitable treatment, organizational flexibility, and training and resources.
Training and Development
 
We believe in encouraging employees in becoming lifelong learners by providing ongoing learning, training and leadership opportunities. We provide our employees with a tuition reimbursement program, and in certain instances, onsite training programs. While we strive to provide real-time recognition of employee performance, we have a formal annual review process not only to determine pay and equity adjustments tied to individual contributions, but to identify areas where training and development may be needed.
Corporate Transparency
 
In early 2022, we released and published on our corporate website (harrowinc.com) our Corporate Transparency Report, which describes and summarizes the initiatives the Company has undertaken and associated metrics related to certain issues including:

● | Energy, Emissions, Waste and Water | ● | Embracing our Community 
--+-----------------------------------------------------+---+------------------------------------------
● | Supply Chain Management | ● | Innovation/Sustainable Products 
● | Community Involvement | ● | Employee Health and Safety 
● | Employee Recruitment, Development and Retention | ● | Governance 
● | Employee Diversity | ● | Drug Safety 
● | Business Ethics, Compliance and Bribery | ● | Data Protection, Patient Data Privacy
