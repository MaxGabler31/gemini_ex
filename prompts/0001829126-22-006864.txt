Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on April 26, 2021 as a Cayman Island exempted company and formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our “initial business combination”. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants (as defined below), the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing.
 
On April 27, 2021, our sponsor paid $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, to cover certain expenses on our behalf in consideration of 7,906,250 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued. In addition, our sponsor has purchased, pursuant to a written agreement, an aggregate of 12,623,125 private placement warrants each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($12,623,125 in the aggregate), in a private placement that closed simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering. If we do not consummate an initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination) from the closing of our initial public offering, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. The personal and financial interests of our executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination. This risk may become more acute as the 15-month (or 18-month if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination) anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering nears, which is the deadline for our consummation of an initial business combination.
 
On October 19, 2021, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 31,625,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units sold, the “Public Shares”), including 4,125,000 Units that were issued pursuant to the underwrites' exercise of their over-allotment option in full, at $10.15 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $320,993,750. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we completed the private sale 14,204,375 warrants to the Sponsor and Jefferies, LLC at a purchase price of $1.00 per warrant (the “Private Placement Warrants”), generating gross proceeds of $14,204,375. A total of $320,993,750 from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”).
 
The outstanding Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares upon the consummation of a business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with a business combination, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of all Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding upon the completion of the Offering plus all Class A Ordinary Shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination, excluding the forward purchase agreements and any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination. The term “equity-linked securities” refers to any debt or equity securities that are convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for Class A Ordinary Shares issued in a financing transaction in connection with the initial Business Combination, including but not limited to a private placement of equity or debt.; provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis.

On December 15, 2021, as disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 17, 2021, the Company, Ravenclaw Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (“Merger Sub”), Ravenclaw Merger Sub Corporation 1, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (“Merger Sub Inc. 1”), Ravenclaw Merger Sub Corporation 2, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (“Merger Sub Inc. 2”), Ravenclaw Merger Sub Corporation 3, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (“Merger Sub Inc. 3” and, together with Merger Sub Inc. 1 and Merger Sub Inc. 2, each a “Blocker Merger Sub”), Boom Clover Business Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation (“Blocker Company 1”), NZSF Frontier Investments Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Blocker Company 2”), PLC Blocker A LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Blocker Company 3” and, together with Blocker Company 1 and Blocker Company 2, each a “Blocker Company” and collectively, the “Blocker Companies”), entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Rubicon Technologies, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Rubicon”) (as it may be amended and/or restated from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”). 
 
In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), Rubicon Interests will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist and be converted into the right to receive securities in Rubicon and/or Pubco as follows: Pubco will be issued Class A Units in Rubicon and holders of Rubicon Interests immediately before the Closing, other than the Blocker Companies (the “Blocked Unitholders”), will be issued Class B Units in Rubicon (the “Continuing Rubicon Unitholders”), in each case, as authorized by the Amended & Restated LLC Operating Agreement of Rubicon that will be adopted at the time of the Merger. Pubco will issue to the Continuing Rubicon Unitholders a number of Surviving Pubco Class V shares equal to the number of Class B Units of Rubicon issued to the Continuing Rubicon Unitholders. Blocked Unitholders immediately before the Closing will be issued Surviving Pubco Class A shares (as a result of the Blocker Mergers). Phantom Unitholders and certain current and former directors, officers and employees of Rubicon will be entitled to receive restricted Surviving Pubco Class A shares, issuable pursuant to the adoption of Pubco’s equity incentive plan (the “Incentive Plan”) and the effectiveness of a registration statement filed by Pubco on Form S-8 following the Closing. Restricted Surviving Pubco Class A shares will vest six months following the Closing.
 
In addition to the securities issuable at the Closing and pursuant to the Incentive Plan, certain officers and employees of Rubicon will be entitled to one-time cash payments (the “Cash Transaction Bonuses”). Any Cash Transaction Bonuses in excess of $17.5 million in the aggregate will reduce the Merger consideration set forth above on a dollar for dollar basis. The total Merger consideration issuable by Rubicon and Pubco to holders of Company Interests, prior to any deduction as a result of the Excess Cash Transaction Bonus Amount, is equal to $1.5 billion.
 
Holders of Rubicon Units (other than Phantom Unitholders) immediately before the Closing will also be entitled to receive a pro rata portion of the number of (i) Surviving Pubco Class A shares and (ii) Class B Units and Surviving Pubco Class V Shares equal, in the aggregate, to 10,389,359, depending upon the performance of Surviving Pubco Class A shares during the five (5) year period after the Closing.
  The consummation of the Merger is conditioned upon, among other things, that (i) the Company has at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Exchange Act, (ii) the expiration or termination of the waiting period (or any extension thereof) applicable under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the “HSR Act”), and (iii) there shall not be in force any order, statute, rule or regulation enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger by a Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated.
 
Rubicon has separate closing conditions, including, among others that the sum of the amount in the Company’s trust account at the Closing (calculated net of any stockholder redemptions but prior to the payment of any transaction expenses), plus the proceeds of the PIPE Financing, equals or exceeds $111 million.
 
The Company has separate closing conditions, including, among others, (i) no Rubicon Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred since the date of the Merger Agreement and (ii) Rubicon has obtained the requisite approval of its interest holders to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
 
The parties to the Merger Agreement have made customary representations, warranties, and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants with respect to the conduct of Rubicon and Company and its subsidiaries prior to the closing of the Merger.
 
The Merger Agreement may be terminated by Company or Acquiror under certain circumstances, including, among others, (i) by mutual written consent of Company and Acquiror, (ii) by Company or Acquiror if either Company or Acquiror has not obtained the required approval of its interest holders or shareholders, and (iii) by Company or Acquiror if the Closing has not occurred on or before the date that is eight (8) months after the date of the Merger Agreement.

Our Business Strategy
 
From infrastructure to applications, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, Digital Transformation spans a wide addressable market. Opportunities to improve capital efficiency and operations through software-enabled solutions exist across every industry. Much of this transformation is fueled by users consuming and transacting across digital channels, increasing worldwide broadband penetration and adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. The ongoing transition in consumer experience and engagement underscores this trend. Per Federal Reserve Economic Data, at the end of 2020, e-commerce transactions constituted 14.0% of all retail sales in the U.S., compared with 10.1% at the end of 2018.5
 
The convergence of increasing technology adoption and changing consumer behavior toward online channels is generating immense data. Per IDC estimates, in 2020 over 64 zettabytes (ZB) of data was expected to be created, captured, copied and consumed in the world, and is estimated to grow at a 23% CAGR through 2025.6 Digital Transformation is driving this exponential increase and presenting innovative entrepreneurs with large opportunities as a result. More companies are constantly developing data-driven solutions to optimize existing processes and explore new ones.
 
While companies that directly face the end-user have received the bulk of investment dollars over recent years, we believe that technologies powering these companies have not received the same investor attention despite their importance to the broader digital ecosystem. IDC estimates that the global enterprise application software market will be $219 billion in 2021, growing at a 6.6% CAGR to $266 billion in 2024.7 We believe that this transformation represents a large, long-term trend, and that, through their backgrounds and networks, our team is well-positioned to uncover and cultivate transformative companies.
 
Many high-growth software companies with significant market share remain private. We believe this presents investors with a rich environment of compelling, long-term opportunities with asymmetric return profiles. We expect that disruptive technology will displace industry incumbents and increase efficiencies, enabling significant market share gains. We believe that these technologies offer significant, global transformational opportunities, and our SPAC is well-positioned to participate in this rapid value creation.
 
Our team and our broader network are comprised of practitioners who are enthusiastic about transformation. Over the course of their respective careers, our executives, advisors, and directors have developed long-standing, valuable networks of founders, builders, public and private company executives, and other investors. These professional and personal networks afford us access to a considerable pipeline of opportunities and market intelligence, and we intend to capitalize on this competitive strength.
 
 Competitive Strengths & Advantages
 
We believe our competitive strength lies in our management team’s experience as not only investors and deal makers, but, most importantly, as owners and operators of large enterprises, both private and public. We believe this combination of skillsets will enable us to guide private companies to the public markets while maintaining the integrity of the target’s mission and values. Our key differentiators are as follows:

- | Depth of experience founding, building, and operating companies. Our management team has founded, built, and operated a variety of companies throughout our respective careers. We collectively possess a wealth of go-to-market insights and access to large partnership ecosystems across various industries. We know how difficult it can be to run a company. We have an entrepreneur-friendly attitude and believe our capital, relationships, and strategic guidance will position targets for substantial growth post-merger.

- | Proven ability to efficiently and effectively run publicly traded businesses. Our Executive Chairman, Hassan Ahmed, has founded and led companies valued at over $43 billion in aggregate, including Sonus Networks, which traded publicly on the Nasdaq. In addition to Mr. Ahmed, several of our nominated directors have experience serving or currently serve on the board of directors of public companies, such as Qualcomm and RingCentral. We believe this public company experience is complemented by the experiences of our broader team in founding and leading several highly valued private companies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Our access to extensive commercial and professional networks. We have developed strong relationships across companies thematically exposed to the Digital Transformation. We believe these relationships afford us access to a pipeline of high-quality and actionable transaction targets. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | We have vast experience in successfully creating value through M&A. Many of our management team members have a long track record of executing business combinations at public and private enterprises. Our disciplined and proven approach to sourcing and structuring transactions have resulted in large amounts of shareholder value. This experience enables us to have confidence in our ability to generate substantial value for the target and our investors. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Combination Criteria
 
Our business combination criteria are focused on finding high-quality companies actively engaged in transformational change. We believe companies within the enterprise value range of $1.0 to $2.5 billion represent an attractive range for acquisition targets, although we would carefully consider compelling opportunities falling outside that range. Although have and will consider targets across industries, we believe that our management’s specific operating experience affords us distinct competitive advantages in terms of sourcing technology targets enabling and advancing Digital Transformation. Within this field, we have targeted industry leaders in SaaS applications, optimization solutions, security, edge computing / internet of things, and big data / artificial intelligence. The key characteristics of the types of companies we targeted are as follows:

- | Positioned to expand aggressively with a clear vision to expand services to underserved markets, geographies, and demographics 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Operating in an industry with strong tailwinds and significant growth potential 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Disrupting its industry and driving new customer growth to gain market share 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Strong financial position with a desire to use proceeds to fund growth 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Financial and operational metrics easily understood by investors 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


- | On a path to becoming public-company ready 
--+-----------------------------------------------


- | Management team with a proven track record of driving revenue growth, enhancing margins, and creating shareholder value 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Management that is looking for guidance and mentorship from a team of operators 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Potential to benefit from our operating expertise and leadership experience 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As listed above, we have taken into consideration certain financial and operational metrics within our decision-making framework. These metrics include, but are not limited to, revenue and annual recurring revenue growth, customer and revenue retention rates (both gross and net), and gross profit margin. We believe targets developing transformative solutions and exhibiting low customer churn, high operating leverage, and outsized growth potential present compelling target candidates.

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation related to the merits of an initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these generic guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, and criteria that our management deems relevant.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
So long as our securities are then listed on Nasdaq, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. If our securities are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net assets test.
 
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.

Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination
 
We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.
 
Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, shareholder approval would typically be required for our initial business combination if, for example:
 

● | We issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then-outstanding (other than in a public offering); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Any of our directors, officers or substantial security holder (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 1% or more (or 5% or more if the related party involved is classified as such solely because such person is a substantial security holder); or 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
 

● | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote; 


● | the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other time and budget constraints of the company; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities
 
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
 
6

 

In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of any such transaction could be to (i) vote in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the general meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 
Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases would be reported by such person pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.15 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination) from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.

Limitations on Redemptions
 
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq rules.
 
If we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:
 

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC. 
--+---------------------------------------

 
In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.

If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, our sponsor and each member of our management team have agreed to vote their founder shares and public shares in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial purchaser’s founder shares, we would need 11,859,375, or 37.5% (assuming all issued and outstanding shares are voted), or 1,976,563, or 6.25% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted), of the 31,625,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. In addition, our sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination) from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.
 
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:
 

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.
 
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval
 
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.

However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
 
Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association.
 
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain provisions designed to provide certain rights and protections relating to our initial public offering that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without a special resolution under Cayman Islands law. As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a resolution is deemed to be a special resolution where it has been approved by either (i) the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (or any higher threshold specified in a company’s articles of association) of a company’s shareholders at a general meeting for which notice specifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been given; or (ii) if so authorized by a company’s articles of association, by a unanimous written resolution of all of the company’s shareholders. Other than as described above, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that special resolutions must be approved either by at least two-thirds of our shareholders (i.e., the lowest threshold permissible under Cayman Islands law), or by a unanimous written resolution of all of our shareholders.
 
Our sponsor and its permitted transferees, if any, who will collectively beneficially own 20% of our ordinary shares upon the closing of our initial public offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in our initial public offering), will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide, among other things, that:
 

● | If we have not consummated an initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination) from the closing of our initial public offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes that were paid by us or are payable by us, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Prior to or in connection with our initial business combination, we may not issue additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares (a) on our initial business combination or on any other proposal presented to shareholders prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (x) extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond 15 months (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination) from the closing of our initial public offering or (y) amend the foregoing provisions; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Although we do not intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or our officers, we are not prohibited from doing so. In the event we enter into such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such a business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If a shareholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act;

● | So long as our securities are then listed on Nasdaq, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If our shareholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination) from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their ordinary shares upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We will not effectuate our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that under no circumstances will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Indemnity
 
Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (1) $10.00 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations.

Facilities
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 11572 Lake Potomac Drive, Potomac MD, 20854. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
 
Employees
 
We currently have one executive officer. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Corporate Information
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $250 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter.
