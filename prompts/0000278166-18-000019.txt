ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Cavco Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed on June 30, 2003, as a successor corporation to previous Cavco entities operating since 1965. Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, the Company designs and produces factory-built homes primarily distributed through a network of independent and Company-owned retailers, planned community operators and residential developers. We are one of the largest producers of manufactured homes in the United States, based on reported wholesale shipments, marketed under a variety of brand names, which include Cavco Homes, Fleetwood Homes, Palm Harbor Homes, Fairmont Homes, Friendship Homes, Chariot Eagle and Lexington Homes. The Company is also a leading builder of park model RVs, vacation cabins and systems-built commercial structures, as well as modular homes built primarily under the Nationwide Homes brand. Cavco's mortgage subsidiary, CountryPlace Acceptance Corp. ("CountryPlace"), is an approved Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA" or "Fannie Mae") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC" or "Freddie Mac") seller/servicer, and a Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA" or "Ginnie Mae") mortgage-backed securities issuer that offers conforming mortgages, non-conforming mortgages and home-only loans to purchasers of factory-built homes. Our insurance subsidiary, Standard Casualty Co. ("Standard Casualty"), provides property and casualty insurance primarily to owners of manufactured homes. The terms "Cavco," "us," "we," "our," the "Company," and any other similar terms refer to Cavco Industries, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report").
We construct our homes using an assembly-line process in which each module or floor section is assembled in stages. Our assembly-line process is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate significant customization, as requested by our customers. The Company operates 20 homebuilding facilities located in the Northwest, Southwest, South, Southeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions.
We distribute our homes through 39 Company-owned U.S. retail outlets and a network of independent distribution points in 47 states, Canada and Japan. Thirty-one of our Company-owned retail stores are located in Texas.
CountryPlace originates single-family residential mortgages and home-only loans, and services, for itself and others, conforming land-home mortgages, non-conforming mortgages and manufactured home-only loans. CountryPlace is authorized by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") to directly endorse Federal Housing Administration ("FHA") Title I and Title II mortgage insurance, is an approved lender with the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs ("VA") and the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") under its Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program, is approved by the GNMA to issue GNMA-insured mortgage-backed securities and is authorized to sell mortgages to, and service mortgages for, the FNMA and the FHLMC. A conforming mortgage or loan is one that conforms to the guidelines of a Government-Sponsored Enterprise ("GSE"), such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or a government agency, such as FHA; a non-conforming mortgage or loan does not conform to these guidelines (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Standard Casualty is domiciled in Texas and is primarily a specialty writer of manufactured home physical damage insurance. Standard Casualty holds insurance licenses in multiple states; however, a significant portion of its writings occur in Texas and Arizona. In addition to writing direct policies, Standard Casualty assumes and cedes reinsurance in the ordinary course of business (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information regarding our business segments, factory-built housing and financial services, both of which are discussed below.

Business Strategies
Our marketing strategy is to offer manufactured homes that appeal to a wide range of home buyers. Our principal focus is on the sale of high-value homes to entry-level and move-up buyers and to persons age 55 and older. We also market to special niches such as subdivision developers and vacation home buyers.
Our production strategy is to develop and maintain the resources necessary to build varied and unique customer specifications in an efficient factory production environment. This enables us to attract retailers and consumers who want the flexibility to customize homes to meet their specific needs, but also seek the value created by building a home on a factory production line.
Our competitive strategy is to build homes of superior quality, offer innovative designs and floor plans, demonstrate exceptional value, provide the engineering and technical resources to enable custom home building and be responsive and efficient in servicing the customer after the sale. We strive to maintain a competitive advantage by reacting quickly to changes in the marketplace and to the specific needs of our retailers and consumers.
Cavco has strategically expanded its factory operations and related business initiatives primarily through the acquisition of industry competitor operations. This has enabled the Company to more broadly participate in the overall housing industry recovery.
The purchase of the Fleetwood Homes, Inc. ("Fleetwood") and Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. ("Palm Harbor") assets in August 2009 and April 2011, respectively, increased home production capabilities and distribution and provided entry into financial services businesses specific to the Company's industry, allowing the Company to be vertically integrated. The transactions further expanded the Company's geographic reach at a national level by adding factories and retail locations serving the Northwest, West, South, South Central and Mid-Atlantic regions.
The purchase of Chariot Eagle, LLC ("Chariot Eagle") and Fairmont Homes, LLC ("Fairmont Homes"), in March 2015 and May 2015, respectively, provided for further operating capacity, increased home production capabilities and further strengthened our market position in the Midwest, the western Great Plains states, the Northeast and several provinces in Canada.
The purchase of Lexington Homes, Inc. ("Lexington Homes") in April 2017 provided additional operating capacity and increased home production capabilities, further expanding our distribution into new Southern markets.
Products
A majority of our products are constructed in accordance with the National Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards promulgated by HUD ("HUD code"). We also build park model RVs, constructed to standards approved by the American National Standards Institute, a private, non-profit organization that administers and coordinates a voluntary standardization and conformity program. Park model RVs are less than 400 square feet in size, are primarily used as vacation dwellings and seasonal living, and are placed in planned communities, recreational home parks and resorts. We also produce a wide variety of modular homes, which include single and multi-module ranch, split-level and Cape Cod style homes, as well as two and three story homes and multi-family units. We also build commercial modular structures, including apartment buildings, condominiums, hotels, workforce housing, schools and housing for U.S. military troops (e.g., barracks). Commercial buildings are constructed in the same facilities in which we build our residential homes using similar assembly line processes and techniques. These commercial projects are generally engineered to the purchaser's specifications. The buildings are transported to the customer's site in the same manner as homes and are often set by crane and finished at the site.
We produce our residential homes in a variety of floor plans. Most of these homes are single-story and generally range in size from approximately 500 to 3,300 square feet, but may be larger in the case of multi-level modular homes. In fiscal years 2018 and 2017, we sold 14,537 and 13,820 homes, respectively.

Each home typically contains a living room, dining area, kitchen, one to five bedrooms and one or more bathrooms, and is equipped with central heating and hot water systems, kitchen appliances, floor coverings and window treatments. Feature upgrades include fireplaces, central air conditioning, tile roofs, high ceilings, skylights, hardwood floors, custom cabinetry, granite countertops and eco-friendly elements. We also offer a variety of structural and decorative customizations to meet the home buyer's specifications. With manufacturing centers strategically positioned across the nation, we utilize local market research to design homes to meet the demands of our customers. We have the ability to react and modify floor plans and designs to consumers' specific needs. By offering a full range of homes from entry-level models to large custom homes and with the ability to engineer designs in-house, we can accommodate a wide spectrum of customer requests.
We regularly introduce new floor plans, decors, exteriors, features and accessories to appeal to changing trends in different regions of the country. We have developed engineering systems which, through the use of computer-aided technology, permit customization of homes and assist with product development and enhancement. We work with a variety of partners, meeting an expanding range of housing needs from a home buyer's private land to planned neighborhoods to recreational or resort properties to accommodations for workforces in agriculture and industry.
We employ a concerted effort to identify niche market opportunities where our diverse product lines and custom building capabilities provide us with a competitive advantage. We are focused on building quality, energy efficient homes for the modern home buyer. Our green building initiatives involve the creation of an energy efficient envelope, including higher utilization of renewable materials. These homes provide environmentally-friendly maintenance requirements, typically lower utility costs, specially designed ventilation systems and sustainability. Cavco also builds homes designed to use alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind. From bamboo flooring and tankless water heaters to solar-powered homes, our products are diverse and tailored to a wide range of consumer interests.
Our manufactured homes are constructed and equipped at our factories. The finished home is then generally transported by independent trucking companies either to a retail sales center, planned community, housing development, work site or the customer's site. Retailers or other independent installers are responsible for placing the home on site and, in most instances, arranging for connections to utilities and providing installation and finish-out services. Although manufactured homes are designed to be transportable, cost considerations cause very few to be moved from their original site after installation.
Factory-built Housing
Manufacturing Operations. Our homes are constructed in factories using an assembly-line process and employing from 112 to 341 employees at each facility. Most of our homes are constructed in one or more sections (also known as floors or modules) on a permanently affixed steel or wood support chassis. Each section is assembled in stages beginning with the construction of the chassis, followed by the addition of other constructed and purchased components and ending with a final quality control inspection. The efficiency of the assembly-line process and the benefits of constructing homes in a controlled factory environment enables us to produce quality homes in less time and at a lower cost per square foot than building homes on individual sites.
We operate 20 manufacturing facilities in Millersburg and Woodburn, Oregon; Nampa, Idaho; Riverside, California; Phoenix and Goodyear, Arizona; Austin, Fort Worth, Seguin and Waco, Texas; Montevideo, Minnesota (2); Nappanee, Indiana; Lafayette, Tennessee; Lexington, Mississippi; Martinsville and Rocky Mount, Virginia; Douglas, Georgia; and Ocala and Plant City, Florida. These manufacturing facilities range from approximately 79,000 to 341,000 square feet of floor space. The production schedules for our manufacturing facilities are based on wholesale orders received from independent and Company-owned retailers. In general, however, our facilities are structured to operate on a one shift per day, five days per week basis, and we currently manufacture a typical home in approximately six production days.

Manufactured housing is a regional business and the primary geographic market for a typical manufacturing facility is within a cost effective shipping radius of 350 miles. Each of our manufacturing facilities serves multiple retailers along with a number of one-time purchasers. Because we produce homes to fill existing wholesale orders, our factories generally do not carry finished goods inventories, except for homes awaiting delivery. Materials used in our homebuilding operations are mainly standard items carried by major suppliers and consist of wood, wood products, steel, gypsum wallboard, windows, doors, fiberglass insulation, carpet, vinyl, fasteners, plumbing materials, aluminum, appliances and electrical items. We generally contract for our materials and labor at a fixed price. Increases in the cost of materials and labor may reduce gross margins from home sales to the extent that increased costs cannot be fully or efficiently recovered through higher home sales prices. From time to time and to varying degrees, we may experience shortages in the availability of materials and/or labor in the markets we serve. These shortages may result in extended order backlogs, delays in the delivery of homes, reduced gross margins from home sales, or all of these.
At March 31, 2018, we had a backlog of home orders with wholesale sales values of approximately $179.0 million, compared to a backlog of $88.8 million at April 1, 2017. Retailers may cancel orders prior to production without penalty. After production of a particular home has commenced, the order becomes noncancelable and the retailer is obligated to take delivery of the home. Accordingly, until production of a particular home has commenced, we do not consider our order backlog to be firm orders. In response to accelerating demand, we have raised production levels by increasing our workforce size and capabilities. However, the constrained labor market is a key challenge to further increasing production to keep pace with increased order rates. In addition, we have implemented higher product pricing to offset rising input costs, including labor and material price increases, although large backlogs may cause deferred realization of the full benefits of these surcharges.
Revenue and Distribution. The Company sold 14,537, 13,820 and 12,339 homes in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, through Company-owned and independent distribution channels.
As of March 31, 2018, we had a total of 39 Company-owned retail centers, located in Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma and Florida. Thirty-one of the Company-owned retail stores are located in Texas. Our Company-owned sales centers are generally located on main roads or highways with high visibility. Each of our Company-owned retail sales centers has a sales office, which is generally a factory-built structure, and a variety of model homes of various sizes, floor plans, features and prices. Customers most often custom order a home that will be built at a manufacturing facility, or they may purchase a home from the inventory of homes maintained at the location, including a model home. Model homes may be displayed in a residential setting with sidewalks and landscaping. Each sales center usually employs a manager and one to five salespersons, who are compensated through a combination of salary and commission. We internally finance home inventories at Company-owned retail centers.
As of March 31, 2018, we had a network of independent distribution points, of which 12% were in Arizona, 11% in Texas, 8% in California, 7% in Florida, and 7% in Oregon, based on the quantity of wholesale shipments during fiscal 2018. The remaining 55% were in 42 other states, Canada and Japan. As is common in the industry, our independent distributors typically sell homes produced by other manufacturers in addition to those we produce. Some independent retailers operate multiple sales outlets. No independent retailer accounted for 10% or more of our factory-built housing revenue during any fiscal year within the three-year period ended March 31, 2018.
We continually seek to increase our wholesale shipments by growing sales at our existing independent retailers and by finding new independent retailers to sell our homes. We provide comprehensive sales training to retail sales associates and bring them to our manufacturing facilities for product training and to view new product designs as they are developed. These training seminars facilitate the sale of our homes by increasing the skill and knowledge of the retail sales consultants. In addition, we display our products in trade shows and support our retailers through the distribution of floor plan literature, brochures, decor selection displays, point of sale promotional material and internet-based marketing assistance.

Independent retailers frequently finance a portion of their home purchases through wholesale floor plan financing arrangements. In most cases, we receive a deposit or a commitment from the retailer's lender for each home ordered. We then manufacture the home and it is shipped at the retailer's expense. Payment is due from the lender upon shipment of the product. For a description of wholesale floor plan financing arrangements used by independent retailers and our obligations in connection with these arrangements, see "Financing—Commercial Financing" below.
Warranties. We provide the retail home buyer a one-year limited warranty covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure, plumbing and electrical systems. Nonstructural components of a cosmetic nature are warranted for 120 days, except in specific cases where state laws require longer warranty terms. Our warranty does not extend to installation and setup of the home, which is generally arranged by the retailer. Appliances, floor coverings, roofing and certain other components are warranted by their original manufacturer for various lengths of time.
Financial Services
Finance. We provide a source of home buyer financing to our customers on competitive terms through our subsidiary, CountryPlace. CountryPlace offers conforming mortgages, non-conforming mortgages and home-only loans to purchasers of numerous brands of factory-built homes sold by Company-owned retail sales centers and certain independent retailers, builders, communities and developers. CountryPlace is authorized to directly endorse FHA Title I and Title II mortgage insurance, is an approved lender with the VA and the USDA under its Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program, is approved to issue GNMA-insured mortgage-backed securities and is authorized to sell mortgages to, and service mortgages for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Most loans originated through CountryPlace are sold to investors. CountryPlace also provides various loan servicing functions for non-affiliated entities under contract.
CountryPlace's loan contracts are fixed and step rate and have monthly scheduled payments of principal and interest. The scheduled payments for each contract would, if made on their respective due dates, result in a full amortization of the contract. Loan contracts secured by collateral that is geographically concentrated could experience higher rates of delinquencies, default and foreclosure losses than loan contracts secured by collateral that is more geographically dispersed. CountryPlace has loan contracts secured by factory-built homes located in 29 states, with the largest concentrations in Texas, Florida, New Mexico and Arizona.
We believe that providing financing alternatives improves our responsiveness to the financing needs of prospective home purchasers and provides us with opportunities for additional sources of loan origination and servicing revenues. CountryPlace has modestly expanded its home-only lending programs in recent years, partially with the support of independent third party financiers. Home-only loans originated are either sold outright, grouped and sold as a pool of loans or held for investment.
Insurance. Standard Casualty specializes in homeowner property and casualty insurance products for the manufactured housing industry. Standard Casualty is domiciled in Texas and holds insurance licenses in multiple states, primarily serving the Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and Georgia markets. In addition to writing direct policies, Standard Casualty assumes and cedes reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. In Texas, policies are written through one affiliated managing general agent, which produces all premiums, and through local agents, most of which are manufactured home retailers. All business outside the state of Texas is written on a direct basis through local agents.

Financing
Commercial Financing. Certain of our wholesale factory-built housing sales to independent retailers were purchased through wholesale floor plan financing arrangements. Under a typical floor plan financing arrangement, an independent financial institution specializing in this line of business provides the retailer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral. The financial institution customarily requires us, as the manufacturer of the home, to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution that, upon default by the retailer and under certain other circumstances, obligates the Company to repurchase the financed home at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement (which, in most cases, is 18 to 36 months). The price at which we may be obligated to repurchase a home under these agreements is based upon the amount financed, plus certain administrative and shipping expenses. Our obligation under these repurchase agreements ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer. The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements was approximately $55.6 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $46.3 million as of April 1, 2017. The risk of loss under these agreements is spread over many retailers and is further reduced by the resale value of the homes.
Faced with illiquid capital markets in late calendar year 2008, significant changes were initiated at each of the manufactured housing sector's remaining inventory finance companies (floor plan lenders), which restricted the availability of inventory financing for the industry. As a result of these changes, the Company enters into commercial loan arrangements with distributors of our products under which the Company provides funds for financing purchases (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company's involvement in commercial loans has increased the availability of manufactured home financing to distributors, communities and developers. While the availability of financing for the industry's wholesale distribution chain has improved, we believe that taking part in the wholesale financing of homes is helpful to borrowers and allows our homes continued exposure to potential home buyers. These initiatives support the Company's ongoing efforts to expand our distribution base in all of our markets with existing and new customers. We have also earned interest income on these loans, which is recorded in Other income, net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. However, the initiatives expose the Company to risks associated with the creditworthiness of certain customers and business partners, including independent retailers, developers, communities and inventory financing partners. 
Consumer Financing. Sales of factory-built homes are significantly affected by the availability and cost of consumer financing. There are three basic types of consumer financing in the factory-built housing industry: conforming mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of FHA, VA, USDA or GSE loans; non-conforming mortgages for purchasers of the home and the land on which the home is placed; and personal property loans (often referred to as home-only or chattel loans) for consumers where the home is the sole collateral for the loan (generally HUD code homes).
Restrictive underwriting guidelines, irregular appraisal processes, higher interest rates compared to mortgages for site-built homes, regulatory burdens, a limited number of institutions lending to manufactured home buyers and limited secondary market availability for manufactured home loans have been significant constraints to industry growth. We are working directly with other industry participants to develop manufactured home consumer financing loan portfolios to attract industry financiers interested in furthering or expanding lending opportunities in the industry. Additionally, we continue to invest in community-based lending initiatives that provide home-only financing to new residents of certain manufactured home communities. Our mortgage subsidiary has developed and invests in home-only lending programs to grow sales of homes through traditional distribution points as well. We believe that growing our participation in home-only lending may provide additional sales growth opportunities for our factory-built housing operations.
7

We are also working through industry trade associations to encourage favorable legislative and GSE action to address the mortgage financing needs of potential buyers of affordable homes. Federal law requires the GSEs to issue a regulation to implement the "Duty to Serve" requirements specified in the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. FNMA and FHLMC released their final Underserved Markets Plan that describes, with specificity, the actions they will take over a three-year period to fulfill the "Duty to Serve" obligation. These plans became effective on January 1, 2018. Each of the three-year plans is intended to establish steps to ensure home-only loans can be purchased in bulk prior to proceeding with a pilot program to purchase these loans. Expansion of the secondary market for home-only lending through the GSEs could provide further demand for housing, as lending options would likely become more available to home buyers. Although some limited progress has been made in this area, meaningful positive impact in the form of increased home orders has yet to be realized.
Industry Overview
General. Manufactured housing provides an alternative in urban, suburban and rural areas to other forms of new low-cost housing such as site-built housing and condominiums, and to existing housing such as pre-owned homes and apartments. According to statistics published by the Institute for Building Technology and Safety ("IBTS") and the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, for the 2017 calendar year, manufactured housing wholesale shipments of homes constructed in accordance with the HUD code accounted for an estimated 13.3% of all new single-family homes sold.
According to data reported by the Manufactured Housing Institute ("MHI"), industry home shipments continue to improve, increasing to approximately 93,000 HUD code manufactured homes shipped during calendar year 2017, compared to the 81,000 shipped during calendar 2016 and 71,000 shipments in 2015. Annual shipments have increased each year since calendar year 2009 when only 50,000 HUD code manufactured homes were shipped, the lowest level since the industry began recording statistics in 1959. While shipments of HUD code manufactured homes have improved modestly in recent years, the manufactured housing industry continues to operate at relatively low levels compared to historical shipment statistics.
Protracted Industry Downturn. Beginning in mid-1999, the manufactured housing industry experienced a prolonged and significant downturn. This downturn resulted in part from the fact that, beginning in 1999, consumer lenders in the sector began to tighten underwriting standards and curtail credit availability in response to higher than anticipated rates of loan defaults and significant losses upon the repossession and resale of the manufactured homes securing defaulted loans. From 2004 to 2007, the industry's downturn was exacerbated by the aggressive financing methods available to customers of developers and marketers of standard site-built homes, which had the effect of diverting potential manufactured housing buyers to more expensive site-built homes. Beginning in 2008, the global credit crisis and general deterioration of economic conditions extended the depressed market conditions in which our industry operates. These factors have resulted in low wholesale shipment levels and underutilized manufacturing and retail locations. However, while the industry continues to operate at generally low levels, as discussed above, industry shipment numbers have been increasing over the past eight years.
Home Buyer Demographics. We believe the segment of the housing market in which manufactured housing is most competitive includes consumers with household incomes under $50,000. This segment has a high representation of young single persons and young married couples, as well as persons age 55 and older. The comparatively low cost of fully-equipped manufactured housing is attractive to these consumers. Persons in rural areas and those who presently live in manufactured homes also make up a significant portion of the demand for new manufactured housing. Innovative engineering and design, as well as efficient production techniques, continue to position manufactured homes to meet the demand for affordable housing in rural markets and manufactured housing communities. The markets for affordable factory-built housing are very competitive as well as cyclical and seasonal. The industry is sensitive to employment levels, consumer confidence, availability of financing and general economic conditions.
8

We believe that employment rates and underemployment among potential home buyers who favor affordable housing as well as consumer confidence levels are improving from low levels reported in recent years. "First-time" and "move-up" buyers of affordable homes are historically among the largest segments of new manufactured home purchasers. Included in this group are lower-income households that were particularly affected by a period of persistently low employment rates and underemployment. The process of repairing damaged credit among such consumers and efforts to save for a home loan down-payment often require substantial time; however, improving consumer confidence in the U.S. economy is evident among manufactured home buyers interested in our products for seasonal or retirement living that have been concerned about financial stability, and now appear to be less hesitant to commit to a new home purchase. We believe sales of our products may continue to increase as employment and consumer confidence levels continue to recover.
The two largest manufactured housing consumer demographics, young adults and those who are 55+ years old, are both growing. The U.S. adult population is estimated to expand by approximately 12.1 million between 2017 and 2022. Young adults born from 1976 to 1995, sometimes referred to as Gen Y, represent a large segment of the population. Late-stage Gen Y is approximately 2.2 million people larger than the next age category born from 1966 to 1975, Gen X, and is considered to be in the peak home-buying years. Gen Y represents prime first-time home buyers who may be attracted by the affordability, diversity of style choices and location flexibility of factory-built homes. The age 55 and older category is reported to be the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population. This group is similarly interested in the value proposition; however, they are also motivated by the energy efficiency and low maintenance requirements of systems-built homes, and by the lifestyle offered by planned communities that are specifically designed for homeowners that fall into this age group.
Competition
The manufactured housing industry is highly competitive at both the manufacturing and retail levels, with competition based upon several factors, including price, product features, reputation for service and quality, depth of distribution, promotion, merchandising and the terms of retail customer financing. We compete with approximately 35 other producers of manufactured homes, as well as companies offering for sale homes repossessed from wholesalers or consumers. In addition, manufactured homes compete with new and existing site-built homes, as well as apartments, townhouses and condominiums.
There are a number of other national manufacturers competing for a significant share of the manufactured housing market in the United States, including Clayton Homes, Inc., Champion Home Builders, Inc. and Skyline Corporation. Certain of these competitors possess greater financial, manufacturing, distribution and marketing resources.
Although many lenders to factory-built home buyers have reduced their volume or exited the business, there are significant competitors to CountryPlace in the markets we serve. These competitors include national, regional and local banks, independent finance companies, mortgage brokers and mortgage banks, such as: 21st Mortgage Corporation, an affiliate of Clayton Homes, Inc. and Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.; Triad Financial Services, Inc.; and CU Factory Built Lending, LP. Certain of these competitors are larger than CountryPlace and have access to substantially more capital and cost efficiencies.
The market for homeowners insurance is highly competitive. Standard Casualty competes principally in property and casualty insurance for owners of manufactured homes with companies such as National Lloyds and American Modern Insurance. We compete based on price, the breadth of our product offerings, product features, customer service, claim handling and use of technology.

Government Regulation
Our manufactured homes are subject to a number of federal, state and local laws, codes and regulations. Construction of manufactured housing is governed by the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, as amended, or the Home Construction Act. In 1976, HUD issued regulations under the Home Construction Act establishing comprehensive national construction standards. In 1994, the codes were amended and expanded to, among other things, address specific requirements for homes destined for geographic areas subject to severe weather conditions. The HUD regulations, known collectively as the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, cover all aspects of manufactured home construction, including structural integrity, fire safety, wind loads, thermal protection and ventilation. Such regulations preempt conflicting state and local regulations on such matters, and are subject to periodic change. Our manufacturing facilities, and the plans and specifications of the HUD code manufactured homes they produce, have been approved by a HUD-certified inspection agency. Further, an independent HUD-certified third-party inspector regularly reviews our manufactured homes for compliance with HUD regulations during construction. Failure to comply with applicable HUD regulations could expose us to a wide variety of sanctions, including mandated closings of our manufacturing facilities. We believe our manufactured homes are in substantial compliance with all present HUD requirements. Our park model RVs are not subject to HUD regulations, but we believe that our park model RVs meet all present standards of the American National Standards Institute.
Manufactured and site-built homes are all typically built with wood products that contain formaldehyde resins. HUD regulates the allowable concentrations of formaldehyde in certain products used in manufactured homes and requires manufacturers to warn purchasers about formaldehyde-associated risks. The Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and other governmental agencies have in the past evaluated the effects of formaldehyde. We use materials in our manufactured homes that meet HUD standards for formaldehyde emissions and believe we comply with HUD and other applicable government regulations in this regard.
The transportation of manufactured homes on highways is subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities. Such regulations may prescribe size and road use limitations and impose lower than normal speed limits and various other requirements.
Our manufactured homes are subject to local zoning and housing regulations. In certain cities and counties in areas where our homes are sold, local governmental ordinances and regulations have been enacted which restrict the placement of manufactured homes on privately-owned land or which require the placement of manufactured homes in manufactured home communities. Such ordinances and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell homes for installation in communities where they are in effect. A number of states have adopted procedures governing the installation of manufactured homes. Utility connections are subject to state and local regulations which must be complied with by the retailer or other person installing the home.
Certain warranties we issue may be subject to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act ("Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act"), which regulates the descriptions of warranties on consumer products. In the case of warranties subject to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, the Company is subject to a number of additional regulatory requirements. For example, warranties that are subject to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act must be included in a single easy-to-read document that is generally made available prior to purchase. The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act also prohibits certain attempts to disclaim or modify implied warranties and the use of deceptive or misleading terms. A claim for a violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act can be the subject of an action in federal court in which consumers may be able to recover attorneys' fees. The description and substance of our warranties are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations. A number of states require manufactured home producers and retailers to post bonds to ensure the satisfaction of consumer warranty claims.
10

A variety of laws affect the financing of the homes we manufacture. The Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act ("Truth-in-Lending Act") and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder require written disclosure of information relating to such financing, including the amount of the annual percentage interest rate and the finance charge. The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act also requires certain disclosures to potential customers concerning credit information used as a basis to deny credit. The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated thereunder prohibit discrimination against any credit applicant based on certain specified grounds. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ("RESPA") and Regulation X promulgated thereunder require certain disclosures regarding the nature and costs of real estate settlements. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") has adopted or proposed various Trade Regulation Rules dealing with unfair credit and collection practices and the preservation of consumers' claims and defenses. Direct loans and mortgage loans eligible for inclusion in a Ginnie Mae security are subject to the credit underwriting requirements of the FHA. A variety of state laws also regulate the form of financing documents and the allowable deposits, finance charge and fees chargeable pursuant to financing documents.
In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act") was passed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act was a sweeping piece of legislation designed to reform credit and lending practices after the global credit crisis of 2008. Although many rules have been implemented, the full impact will not be known for years as rule revisions and the enforcement of the rules continue to evolve. On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Reform Act") was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Reform Act revises portions of the Dodd-Frank Act, reduces the regulatory burden on smaller financial institutions, including eliminating provisions of the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 ("SAFE Act"), and protects consumer access to credit. With the elimination of certain provisions of the SAFE Act, manufactured housing retailers can now assist home buyers with securing financing for the purchase of homes; however, they may not assist in negotiating the financing terms. This will enable buyers to more easily find access to financing and make the overall home buying experience smoother.
Certain CFPB mortgage finance rules required under the Dodd-Frank Act, and modified by the Dodd-Frank Reform Act apply to consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling, which include real property mortgages and home-only loans (financed without land) secured by manufactured homes. These rules defined standards for origination of "Qualified Mortgages," established specific requirements for lenders to prove borrowers' ability to repay loans, and outlined the conditions under which Qualified Mortgages are subject to safe harbor limitations on liability to borrowers. The rules also establish interest rates and other cost parameters for determining which Qualified Mortgages fall under safe harbor protection. Among other issues, Qualified Mortgages with interest rates and other costs outside the limits are deemed "rebuttable" by borrowers and expose the lender and its assignees (including investors in loans, pools of loans, and instruments secured by loans or loan pools) to possible litigation and penalties.
While many manufactured homes are currently financed with agency-conforming mortgages in which the ability to repay is verified, and interest rates and other costs are within the safe harbor limits established under the CFPB mortgage finance rules, certain loans to finance the purchase of manufactured homes, especially home-only loans and non-conforming land-home loans, may fall outside the safe harbor limits. The rules have caused some lenders to curtail underwriting such loans, and some investors are reluctant to own or participate in owning such loans because of the uncertainty of potential litigation and other costs. As a result, some prospective buyers of manufactured homes may be unable to secure the financing necessary to complete purchases. In addition, compliance with the law and ongoing rule implementation has caused lenders to incur additional costs to implement new processes, procedures, controls and infrastructure required to comply with the regulations. Compliance may constrain lenders' ability to profitably price certain loans. Failure to comply with these regulations, changes in these or other regulations, or the imposition of additional regulations, could affect our earnings, limit our access to capital and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

The CFPB rules amending the Truth-in-Lending Act ("TILA") and RESPA expanded the types of mortgage loans that are subject to the protections of the Home Ownership and Equity Protections Act of 1994 ("HOEPA"), revised and expanded the tests for coverage under HOEPA, and imposed additional restrictions on mortgages that are covered by HOEPA. As a result, certain manufactured home loans are subject to HOEPA limits on interest rates and fees. Loans with rates or fees in excess of the limits are deemed High Cost Mortgages and provide additional protections for borrowers, including with respect to determining the value of the home. Most loans for the purchase of manufactured homes have been written at rates and fees that would not appear to be considered High Cost Mortgages under the new rule. Although some lenders may continue to offer loans that are now deemed High Cost Mortgages, the rate and fee limits appear to have deterred some lenders from offering loans to certain borrowers and may continue to make them reluctant to enter into loans subject to the provisions of HOEPA. As a result, some prospective buyers of manufactured homes may be unable to secure financing necessary to complete manufactured home purchases.
The Dodd-Frank Act amended provisions of TILA to require rules for appraisals on principal residences securing higher-priced mortgage loans ("HPML"). Certain loans secured by manufactured homes, primarily home-only loans, could be considered HPMLs. Among other things, the rules require creditors to provide copies of appraisal reports to borrowers prior to loan closing. To implement these amendments, the CFPB adopted the HPML Appraisal Rule, effective December 30, 2014, and loans secured by new manufactured homes were exempt from the rule until July 18, 2015. While effects of these requirements are not fully known, some prospective home buyers may be deterred from completing a manufactured home purchase as a result of appraised values.
The Dodd-Frank Act also required integrating disclosures provided by lenders to borrowers under TILA and RESPA. The final rule became effective October 3, 2015. The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure ("TRID") mandated extensive changes to the mortgage loan closing process and necessitated significant changes to mortgage origination systems.
Regulation C of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ("HMDA") enacted in 1975 requires certain financial institutions, including non-depository institutions, to collect, record, report and disclose information about their mortgage lending activity. The data-related requirements in the HMDA and Regulation C are used to identify potential discriminatory lending patterns and enforce anti-discrimination statutes. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred rulemaking authority for HMDA to the CFPB, effective in 2011. It also amended the HMDA to require financial institutions to report additional data points and to collect, record and report additional information. The CFPB issued a final rule amending Regulation C, which became effective on January 1, 2018. Regulation C generally applies to consumer-purpose, closed-end loans and open-end lines of credit that are secured by a dwelling. Non-depository financial institutions are subject to Regulation C if they originate at least 25 covered closed-end mortgage loans or at least 100 covered open-end lines of credit in each of the two preceding calendar years. Violations of Regulation C, including incomplete, inaccurate, or omitted data are subject to administrative sanctions, including civil money penalties and compliance can be enforced by the Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, HUD or the CFPB.
New FHA Title I program guidelines became effective on June 1, 2010 and provide Ginnie Mae the ability to securitize manufactured home FHA Title I loans. These guidelines were intended to allow lenders to obtain new capital, which can then be used to fund new loans for our customers. Home-only loans have languished for several years and these changes were meant to broaden home-only financing availability for prospective homeowners. However, we are aware of only a small number of loans currently being securitized under the Ginnie Mae program.

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 requires the GSEs to facilitate a secondary market for mortgages on housing for very low, low and moderate-income families in under-served markets, including manufactured housing. On January 30, 2017, the Federal Housing Finance Agency issued a final rule specifying the scope of GSE activities that are eligible to receive credit for compliance with the "Duty to Serve" rule after January 2018. On December 18, 2017, Both GSEs published their final Underserved Markets Plans for activities for the years beginning January 1, 2018, and continuing through 2020. Both GSE plans include initiatives to facilitate increased purchases of real property mortgages with manufactured homes under their existing single-family programs beginning in 2018 and small-scale pilot programs for home-only loans secured by manufactured housing beginning in 2019.
Our sale of insurance products is subject to various state insurance laws and regulations which govern allowable charges and other insurance practices. Standard Casualty's insurance operations are regulated by the state insurance boards where it underwrites its policies. Underwriting, premiums, investments and capital reserves (including dividend payments to stockholders) are subject to the rules and regulations of these state agencies.
In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the "Health Reform Law"), was passed into law. As enacted, the Health Reform Law reforms, among other things, certain aspects of health insurance. The Health Reform Law could continue to increase our healthcare costs, adversely impacting the Company's earnings.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affect the Company and include, but are not limited to: (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate, (2) allowing bonus depreciation for full expensing of qualified property and (3) eliminating the manufacturing deduction. The Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% for our fiscal year ending March 30, 2019. As a result of these changes, our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, had a blended corporate tax rate of 31.54%, which is based on the tax rate before and after the Tax Act and the number of days in the fiscal year.
On January 25, 2018, HUD announced a top-to-bottom review of its manufactured housing rules as part of a broader effort to identify regulations that may be ineffective, overly burdensome, or excessively costly given the critical need for affordable housing. If certain changes are made, the Company may be able to more effectively serve buyers of affordable homes.
Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with applicable regulations, and violations may result in the payment of fines, the entry of injunctions or both. Although we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the requirements of all applicable laws and regulations, these requirements have generally become more stringent in recent years. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with all applicable laws and enforcement policies.
Seasonality
The housing industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations based on new home buyer purchasing patterns. Cavco's Company-owned retail stores typically experience decreased home buyer traffic during holidays and popular vacation periods. Still, diversification among Cavco's product lines and operations have served to partially offset the extent of seasonal fluctuations. Demand for our core single-family new home products typically peaks each spring and summer before declining in the winter, consistent with the overall housing industry, although this pattern was partially interrupted during the winter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, when the Company produced a limited number of disaster-relief homes for the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA"). Demand patterns for park model RVs, cabins and homes used primarily for retirement seasonal living partially offset the general housing seasonality.

The Company's mortgage subsidiary experiences minimal seasonal fluctuation in its mortgage origination activities as a result of the time needed for loan application approval processes and subsequent home loan closing activities. The mortgage subsidiary realizes no seasonal impacts from its mortgage servicing operations. Revenue for the home insurance subsidiary is not substantially impacted by seasonality as it recognizes revenue from policy sales ratably over each policy's term year. However, the insurance subsidiary is subject to adverse effects from excessive policy claims that may occur during periods of inclement weather, including seasonal spring storms or fall hurricane activity in Texas where most of its policies are underwritten. Where applicable, losses from catastrophic events are somewhat limited by reinsurance contracts in place as part of the Company's loss mitigation structure.
In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey produced the largest recorded rain volume for a single weather event in U.S. history, resulting in historic flooding and widespread property damage, primarily in southeast Texas. Although our insurance subsidiary does not write policies for manufactured home residents in gulf coast counties or in flood plains, the enormity of this event caused high homeowners' insurance claim volume inland and in non-flood plain areas. The insurance subsidiary's catastrophic reinsurance contracts served to limit financial exposure to a pre-established retention amount of $1.5 million; however, these contracts also carried the requirement for the Company to pay additional premiums in order to reinstate reinsurance coverage for the remainder of calendar year 2017, further adding to costs incurred as a result of the hurricane.
In September 2017, Hurricane Irma caused significant property damage in Florida. The insurance subsidiary conducts no operations in Florida and was not adversely affected by this storm.
It has been widely reported that the overall economic toll in the affected hurricane market areas is substantial. There has been somewhat increased consumer demand for replacement of homes lost as a result of these events, which we expect to continue for several quarters. This may include demand for additional disaster-relief manufactured home orders from federal and state agencies. The Company has initially participated by producing a limited number of disaster-relief homes for FEMA. These homes were built in factories located in unaffected regions of the country, primarily during the winter months, which lessened disruptions to existing order demand from our core customer base.
