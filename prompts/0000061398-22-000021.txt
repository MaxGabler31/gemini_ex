ITEM 1 AND 2. OUR BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES
Overview
Tellurian Inc. (“Tellurian,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is a Houston-based company that intends to create value for shareholders by building a low-cost, global natural gas business, profitably delivering natural gas to customers worldwide (the “Business”). We are developing a portfolio of natural gas, LNG marketing, and infrastructure assets that includes an LNG terminal facility (the “Driftwood terminal”), an associated pipeline (the “Driftwood pipeline”), other related pipelines, and upstream natural gas assets. The Driftwood terminal and the Driftwood pipeline are collectively referred to as the “Driftwood Project”. Our existing natural gas assets consist of 11,060 net acres and interests in 78 producing wells located in the Haynesville Shale trend of northern Louisiana. Our Business may be developed in phases. 
As part of our execution strategy, which includes increasing our asset base, we will consider various commercial arrangements with third parties across the natural gas value chain. We are also pursuing activities such as direct sales of LNG to global counterparties, trading of LNG, the acquisition of additional upstream acreage and drilling of new wells on our existing or newly acquired upstream acreage. As discussed in “Overview of Significant Events – LNG Sale and Purchase Agreements” below, in 2021 we entered into four LNG SPAs with three unrelated purchasers, completing the planned sales for plants one and two of the Driftwood terminal (“Phase 1”). We are currently focused on securing financing for the construction of Phase 1.
We continue to evaluate the scope and other aspects of our Business in light of the evolving economic environment, needs of potential counterparties and other factors. How we execute our Business will be based on a variety of factors, including the results of our continuing analysis, changing business conditions and market feedback.
Overview of Significant Events
LNG Sale and Purchase Agreements
Driftwood LNG LLC (“Driftwood LNG”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into the following SPAs with three purchasers for the purchase of a total of 9.0 Mtpa of LNG:
• An SPA with Gunvor Singapore Pte Ltd (“Gunvor”) in May 2021 for the purchase of 3.0 Mtpa of LNG;
• An SPA with Vitol Inc. (“Vitol”) in June 2021 for the purchase of 3.0 Mtpa of LNG; and
• Two SPAs with Shell NA LNG LLC (“Shell”) in July 2021 for the purchase of 3.0 Mtpa of LNG.
The price for LNG sold under the SPAs with Gunvor and Vitol will be a blended average based on the JKM index price and the TTF futures contract price, in each case minus a transportation netback. The price for LNG sold under each SPA with Shell will be based on the JKM index price or the TTF futures contract price, in each case minus a transportation netback. Each SPA has a ten-year term from the date of first commercial delivery from the Driftwood terminal.
Initiated Owner Construction Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021 we initiated owner construction activities necessary to proceed under our LSTK EPC agreements with Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc. (“Bechtel”).
Driftwood Land Lease Agreement
On July 1, 2021, we entered into a long-term ground lease agreement with the Lake Charles Harbor and Terminal District to secure property essential for the construction of the Driftwood terminal.
Environmental, Social, Governance Practices
During the year ended December 2021, the Company began a partnership with the National Forest Foundation on a five-year plan for reforestation and other forest management projects totaling $25 million across the United States. One of the first identified projects is to re-plant 300,000 trees in the Kisatchie National Forest, located near Alexandria, Louisiana, where nearly 40,000 acres of native trees were lost due to extreme weather events during the past few years. 
Upstream Drilling Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed the drilling of and put in production four new Haynesville operated natural gas wells. We also participated in the drilling of six Haynesville non-operated natural gas wells. Our 2021 drilling activities increased our proved developed reserves by approximately 51 Bcfe as of December 31, 2021.
Repayment of Borrowing Obligations 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repaid all borrowing obligations that were outstanding at the end of December 31, 2020. For further information regarding the repayment of our borrowing obligations, see Note 10 - Borrowings, of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Equity Offering
On August 6, 2021, we sold 35.0 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price of $3.00 per share. Net proceeds from this offering, after deducting fees and expenses, were approximately $100.8 million. The underwriters were granted an option to purchase up to an additional 5.3 million shares of common stock within 30 days. On August 31, 2021, the underwriters exercised this option, which generated net proceeds, after deducting fees, of approximately $15.1 million.
8.25% Senior Notes due 2028
On November 10, 2021, we sold $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.25% Senior Notes due November 30, 2028 (the “Senior Notes”) in a registered public offering. Net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes were approximately $47.5 million after deducting fees. The underwriter was granted an option to purchase up to an additional $7.5 million of the Senior Notes within 30 days. On December 7, 2021, the underwriter exercised the option and purchased an additional $6.5 million of the Senior Notes, which generated net proceeds of approximately $6.2 million after deducting fees.
At-the-Market Debt Offering Program
On December 17, 2021, we entered into an at-the-market debt offering program under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time on the NYSE American, up to an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million of additional Senior Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not sell any additional Senior Notes under the at-the-market debt offering program.
Natural Gas Properties 
Reserves
Our natural gas assets consist of 11,060 net acres and interests in 78 producing wells located in the Haynesville Shale trend of north Louisiana. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our average net production was approximately 39.2 MMcf/d. All of our proved reserves were associated with those properties as of December 31, 2021. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and condensate which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions (i.e., costs as of the date the estimate is made). Proved reserves are categorized as either developed or undeveloped.
Our reserves as of December 31, 2021 were estimated by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), an independent petroleum engineering firm, and are set forth in the following table. Per SEC rules, NSAI based its estimates on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price of natural gas for each month from January through December 2021. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided for under contractual arrangements, but not on escalations or reductions based upon future conditions. The price used for the reserve estimates as of December 31, 2021 was $3.60 per MMBtu of natural gas, adjusted for energy content, transportation fees and market differentials. 
The following table shows our proved reserves as of December 31, 2021:

 | Gas (MMcf)
Proved reserves (as of December 31, 2021): | 
Developed | 73,927 
Undeveloped | 249,409 
Total | 323,336 

As of December 31, 2021, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow from our proved reserves (the “standardized measure”) was approximately $364.2 million. 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not have any material capital expenditures related to the development of our undeveloped reserves and thus did not convert any meaningful quantities from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. As of December 31, 2021, we do not expect to have any proved undeveloped reserves that will remain undeveloped for more than five years from the date that they were initially booked.
Refer to Supplemental Disclosures About Natural Gas Producing Activities, starting on page 63, for additional details. 
Controls Over Reserve Report Preparation, Technical Qualifications and Technologies Used
Our December 31, 2021 reserve report was prepared by NSAI in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC. Reserve definitions comply with the definitions provided by Regulation S‑X of the SEC. NSAI prepared the reserve report based upon a review of property interests being appraised, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, geoscience and engineering data, and other information we provided to them. This information was reviewed by knowledgeable members of our Company for accuracy and completeness prior to submission to NSAI. A letter that identifies the professional qualifications of the individual at NSAI who was responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates as of December 31, 2021, has been filed as an addendum to Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated by reference herein.
Internally, a Senior Vice President is responsible for overseeing our reserves process. Our Senior Vice President has over 20 years of experience in the oil and natural gas industry, with the majority of that time in reservoir engineering and asset management. She is a graduate of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University with dual degrees in Chemical Engineering and French, and a graduate of the University of Houston with a Masters of Business Administration degree. During her career, she has had multiple responsibilities in technical and leadership roles, including reservoir engineering and reserves management, production engineering, planning, and asset management for multiple U.S. onshore and international projects. She is also a licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas.
Production
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we produced 14,302 MMcf, 16,893 MMcf and 13,901 MMcf of natural gas at an average sales price of $3.52, $1.74 and $2.07 per Mcf, respectively. Natural gas and condensate production and operating costs for the periods ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $0.48, $0.28 and $0.25 per Mcfe, respectively.
Drilling Activity
The table below shows the number of net productive and dry development wells drilled during the past three years. The information in the table below should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation among the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found, or economic value. A dry well is an exploratory, development, or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well. A productive well is an exploratory, development, or extension well that is not a dry well. Completion refers to installation of permanent equipment for production of oil or gas, or, in the case of a dry well, to reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned. The number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the fiscal year, regardless of when drilling was initiated. 
 | For the Year Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | 2020 | | 2019
Development wells: | | | | 
Productive | 6.9 | | — | | 3.1
Dry | — | | — | | — 
We had no exploratory wells drilled during any of the periods presented. | | | | 

Wells and Acreage 
As of December 31, 2021, we owned working interests in 65 gross (28 net) productive natural gas wells. We have 4,419 gross (4,100 net) developed leasehold acres that are held by production. Additionally, we hold 7,448 gross (6,960 net) undeveloped leasehold acres. As of December 31, 2021, there were seven gross (3.33 net) in process wells.
Of the total gross and net undeveloped acreage, 1,995 gross and 1,901 net acres are not held by production, of which no acres are set to expire in 2022.
Volume Commitments
We are not currently subject to any material volume commitments.
Gathering, Processing and Transportation 
As part of our acquisitions of natural gas properties, we also acquired certain gathering systems that deliver the natural gas we produce into third-party gathering systems. We believe that these systems and other available midstream facilities and services in the Haynesville Shale trend are adequate for our current operations and near-term growth. 
Government Regulations
Our operations are and will be subject to extensive federal, state and local statutes, rules, regulations, and laws that include, but are not limited to, the NGA, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”), the Oil Pollution Act, the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), the Clean Air Act (the “CAA”), the Clean Water Act (the “CWA”), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (the “PSIA”), and the Coastal Zone Management Act (the “CZMA”). These statutes cover areas related to the authorization, construction and operation of LNG facilities, natural gas pipelines and natural gas producing properties, including discharges and releases to the air, land and water, and the handling, generation, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes due to the development, construction and operation of the facilities. These laws are administered and enforced by governmental agencies including but not limited to FERC, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), DOE/FE, the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources. Additionally, numerous other governmental and regulatory permits and approvals will be required to build and operate our Business, including, with respect to the construction and operation of the Driftwood Project, consultations and approvals by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, USACE, U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security. For example, throughout the life of our liquefaction project, we will be subject to regular reporting requirements to FERC, PHMSA and other federal and state regulatory agencies regarding the operation and maintenance of our facilities.
Failure to comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations could result in substantial administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties and/or failure to secure and retain necessary authorizations.
We have received regulatory permits and approvals in connection with the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline, including the following:

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
The design, construction and operation of liquefaction facilities and pipelines, the export of LNG and the transportation of natural gas are highly regulated activities. In order to site, construct and operate the Driftwood Project, we obtained authorizations from FERC under Section 3 and Section 7 of the NGA as well as several other material governmental and regulatory approvals and permits as detailed in the table above. In order to gain regulatory certainty with respect to certain potential commercial transactions, on November 13, 2020, Driftwood Holdings LP (“Driftwood Holdings”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Driftwood LNG (jointly, “Driftwood”) filed a Petition with FERC requesting, among other things, a prospective limited waiver of FERC’s buy/sell prohibition as well as any other prospective waivers necessary to enable Driftwood to purchase natural gas from potentially affiliated upstream suppliers that may be resold to a different affiliate under a long-term contract for export as LNG in foreign commerce. On January 19, 2021, FERC issued an order granting a prospective limited waiver of the prohibition on buy/sell arrangements for future proposed transactions in which Driftwood enters into: (1) an agreement to purchase natural gas from a potentially affiliated supplier; and (2) an agreement to sell LNG to affiliates in foreign commerce. 
EPAct 2005 amended Section 3 of the NGA to establish or clarify FERC’s exclusive authority to approve or deny an application for the siting, construction, expansion or operation of LNG terminals, although except as specifically provided in 
EPAct 2005, nothing in the statute is intended to affect otherwise applicable law related to any other federal agency’s authorities or responsibilities related to LNG terminals.
In 2002, FERC concluded that it would apply light-handed regulation to the rates, terms and conditions agreed to by parties for LNG terminalling services, such that LNG terminal owners would not be required to provide open-access service at non-discriminatory rates or maintain a tariff or rate schedule on file with FERC, as distinguished from the requirements applied to FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipelines. Although EPAct 2005 codified FERC’s policy, those provisions expired on January 1, 2015. Nonetheless, we see no indication that FERC intends to modify its longstanding policy of light-handed regulation of LNG terminal operations.
A certificate of public convenience and necessity from FERC is required for the construction and operation of facilities used in interstate natural gas transportation, including pipeline facilities, in addition to other required governmental and regulatory approvals. In this regard, in April 2019, we obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct and operate the Driftwood pipeline. On June 17, 2021, Driftwood Pipeline LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, filed an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the NGA in FERC Docket No. CP21-465-000 requesting that FERC grant a certificate of public convenience and necessity and related approvals to construct, own and operate dual 42-inch diameter natural gas pipelines, an approximately 211,200 horsepower compressor station and appurtenant facilities to be located in Beauregard and Calcasieu Parishes, Louisiana, which would provide a maximum seasonal capacity of 5.7 Bcf of natural gas per day. The application is currently pending. 
FERC’s jurisdiction under the NGA generally extends to the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial or any other use and to natural gas companies engaged in such transportation or sale. FERC’s jurisdiction does not extend to the production, gathering, local distribution or export of natural gas.
Specifically, FERC’s authority to regulate interstate natural gas pipelines includes:
•rates and charges for natural gas transportation and related services;
•the certification and construction of new facilities;
•the extension and abandonment of services and facilities;
•the maintenance of accounts and records;
•the acquisition and disposition of facilities;
•the initiation and discontinuation of services; and
•various other matters.
In addition, FERC has the authority to approve, and if necessary set, “just and reasonable rates” for the transportation or sale of natural gas in interstate commerce. Relatedly, under the NGA, our proposed pipelines will not be permitted to unduly discriminate or grant undue preference as to rates or the terms and conditions of service to any shipper, including our own affiliates.
EPAct 2005 amended the NGA to make it unlawful for any entity, including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by FERC. The anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales, gathering or production, but does apply to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” natural gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. EPAct 2005 also gives FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA or Natural Gas Policy Act of up to $1 million per violation.
Transportation of the natural gas we produce, and the prices we pay for such transportation, will be significantly affected by the foregoing laws and regulations.
U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Fossil Energy Export License
Under the NGA, exports of natural gas to FTA countries are “deemed to be consistent with the public interest,” and authorization to export LNG to FTA countries shall be granted by the DOE/FE “without modification or delay.” FTA countries currently capable of importing LNG include but are not limited to Canada, Chile, Colombia, Jordan, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea and the Dominican Republic. Exports of natural gas to Non-FTA countries are authorized unless the DOE/FE “finds that the proposed exportation” “will not be consistent with the public interest.” We have authorization from the DOE/FE to export LNG in a volume up to the equivalent of 1,415.3 Bcf per year of natural gas to FTA countries for a term of 30 years and to Non-FTA countries for a term through December 31, 2050.
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration
The Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (the “NGPSA”) authorizes DOT to regulate pipeline transportation of natural (flammable, toxic, or corrosive) gas and other gases, as well as the transportation and storage of LNG. Amendments to the NGPSA include the Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, which addresses liquids pipelines, and the PSIA, which governs the areas of testing, education, training, and communication.
PHMSA administers pipeline safety regulations for jurisdictional gas gathering, transmission, and distribution systems under minimum federal safety standards. PHMSA also establishes and enforces safety regulations for onshore LNG facilities, which are defined as pipeline facilities used for the transportation or storage of LNG subject to such safety standards. Those regulations address requirements for siting, design, construction, equipment, operations, personnel qualification and training, fire protection, and security of LNG facilities. The Driftwood terminal will be subject to such PHMSA regulations.
The Driftwood pipeline and other related pipelines will also be subject to regulation by PHMSA, including those under the PSIA. The PHMSA Office of Pipeline Safety administers the PSIA, which requires pipeline companies to perform extensive integrity tests on natural gas transportation pipelines that exist in high population density areas designated as “high consequence areas.” Pipeline companies are required to perform the integrity tests on a seven-year cycle. The risk ratings are based on numerous factors, including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline, as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating. Testing consists of hydrostatic testing, internal electronic testing, or direct assessment of the piping. In addition to the pipeline integrity tests, pipeline companies must implement a qualification program to make certain that employees are properly trained. Pipeline operators also must develop integrity management programs for natural gas transportation pipelines, which requires pipeline operators to perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity; identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area; improve data collection, integration and analysis; repair and remediate the pipeline, as necessary; and implement preventive and mitigative actions.
On December 27, 2020, the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act (PIPES Act) of 2020 was signed into law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. The legislation reauthorizes the PHMSA pipeline safety program through fiscal year 2023 and provides for advances to improve pipeline safety. The legislation includes a directive to PHMSA to update its current regulations for large-scale LNG facilities. 
On January 11, 2021, PHMSA published a final rule in the Federal Register amending the Federal Pipeline Safety Regulations to reduce regulatory burdens and offer greater flexibility with respect to the construction, maintenance, and operation of gas transmission, distribution, and gathering pipeline systems, including updates to corrosion control requirements and test requirements for pressure vessels. Mandatory compliance with this rule started October 1, 2021. This rule is subject to review for possible modification pursuant to executive orders signed by President Biden on or shortly after January 20, 2021.
On November 15, 2021, PHMSA published a final rule in the Federal Register revising the Federal Pipeline Safety Regulations to improve the safety of onshore gas gathering pipelines. The rule extends reporting requirements to all gas gathering operators and applies a set of minimum safety requirements to certain gas gathering pipelines with large diameters and high operating pressures. This rule goes into effect on May 16, 2022.
The Driftwood pipeline and other related pipelines will be subject to regulation under PHMSA, which will involve capital and operating costs for compliance-related equipment and operations. We have no reason to believe that these compliance costs will be material to our financial performance, but the significance of such costs will depend on future events and our ability to achieve and maintain compliance throughout the life of the Driftwood Project or related pipelines.
Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968
Louisiana administers federal pipeline safety standards under the NGPSA, which requires certain pipelines to comply with safety standards in constructing and operating the pipelines and subjects the pipelines to regular inspections. Failure to comply with the NGPSA may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal sanctions.
Other Governmental Permits, Approvals and Authorizations
The construction and operation of the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline are subject to federal permits, orders, approvals and consultations required by other federal and state agencies, including DOT, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, USACE, U.S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the EPA and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The necessary permits required for construction have been obtained and will be maintained for the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline. Similarly, additional permits, orders, approvals and consultations will be required for other related pipelines.
Three significant permits that apply to the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline are the USACE Section 404 of the CWA/Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act Permit, the CAA Title V Operating Permit and the Prevention of 
Significant Deterioration Permit, of which the latter two permits are issued by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. Each of the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline has received its permit from USACE, including a review and approval by USACE of the findings and conditions set forth in an Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision issued for the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline pursuant to the requirements of NEPA. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has issued the Prevention of Significant Deterioration permit, which is required to commence construction of the Driftwood terminal as well as the Title V Operating Permit. These material approvals may be required for other related pipelines.
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are and will be subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources, the handling, generation, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes and other matters. These environmental laws and regulations, which can restrict or prohibit impacts to the environment or the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment, will require significant expenditures for compliance, can affect the cost and output of operations, may impose substantial administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance and can result in substantial liabilities. The statutes, regulations and permit requirements imposed under environmental laws are modified frequently, sometimes retroactively. Such changes are difficult to predict or prepare for, and may impose material costs for new permits, capital investment or operational limitations or changes.
The Biden Administration has issued a number of executive orders that direct federal agencies to take actions that may change regulations and guidance applicable to our business. 
Executive Order 14008, “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,” 86 FR 7619 (January 27, 2021), establishes a policy “promoting the flow of capital toward climate-aligned investments and away from high-carbon investments.” It also requires the heads of agencies to identify any fossil fuel subsidies provided by their respective agencies, and to seek to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies from the budget request for fiscal year 2022 and thereafter. 
Executive Order 13990, “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis,” 86 FR 7037 (January 20, 2021) directs agencies to review regulations and policies adopted by the Trump Administration and to “confront the climate crisis.” It specifically directs the EPA to consider suspending, revising or rescinding certain regulations, including restrictions on emissions from the oil and gas sector. In addition, Executive Order 13990 establishes a federal inter-agency working group to recommend methods for agencies to incorporate the “social cost of carbon” into their decision making. Finally, Executive Order 13990 directs the White House Council on Environmental Quality to rescind draft guidance restricting the review of climate change issues in reviews under NEPA and to update regulations to strengthen climate change reviews. On March 8, 2021, 12 states filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri challenging President Biden's authority to establish interim values for the social cost of greenhouse gases under Executive Order 13990; the case is currently pending appeal before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. 
NEPA. NEPA and comparable state laws and regulations require that government agencies review the environmental impacts of proposed projects. On July 16, 2020, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (the “CEQ”) published a final rule to “modernize and clarify” the prior NEPA implementation regulations and to streamline environmental reviews required by NEPA (the “Revised NEPA Regulations”). The Revised NEPA Regulations set a presumptive time limit for completion of NEPA reviews and limit the scope of NEPA reviews to those effects that are reasonably foreseeable and have a reasonably close causal relationship to the proposed action or alternatives. While these changes are not likely to require amendments to the USACE permits and NEPA-related findings that were completed prior to the effective date of the final NEPA rule, the changes in the NEPA regulations may impact new permits, permit modifications and other elements of the Driftwood Project and related pipelines that are under development. The Revised NEPA Regulations are currently subject to legal challenges. On October 7, 2021, the CEQ published a notice of proposed rulemaking to announce a set of proposed changes to generally restore prior regulatory provisions. Therefore, the impact on the Driftwood Project and related pipelines of the previously Revised NEPA Regulations and new NEPA regulations and guidance is not determinable at this time.
Clean Air Act. The CAA and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources and impose various monitoring and reporting requirements, among other requirements. The Driftwood Project and related pipelines include facilities and operations that are subject to the federal CAA and comparable state and local laws, including requirements to obtain pre-construction permits and operating permits. We may be required to incur capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining permits and approvals pursuant to the CAA and comparable state laws and regulations.
In August 2020, the EPA issued two final rules that revised the new source performance standards under the CAA (the “2020 CAA Revisions”) to require reductions in emissions, including methane emissions, from new and modified sources in the oil and natural gas sector. On June 30, 2021, President Biden signed into law a joint Congressional resolution disapproving many of the 2020 CAA Revisions pursuant to the Congressional Review Act making the disapproved portions of the 2020 CAA Revisions no longer effective. In November 2021, the EPA published a proposed rule that would update and expand existing 
requirements for the oil and gas industry, as well as creating significant new requirements and standards for new, modified and existing oil and gas facilities. The proposed new requirements would include, for example, new standards and emission limitations applicable to storage vessels, well liquids unloading, pneumatic controllers, and flaring of natural gas at both new and existing facilities. The proposed rules for new and modified facilities are expected to be finalized by the end of 2022, while any standards finalized for existing facilities will require further state rulemaking actions over the next several years before they become applicable and effective. The comment period for that proposed rule was extended until January 31, 2022. Therefore, the impact of the revised oil and gas new source performance standards on the Driftwood Project and other related pipelines and Tellurian’s compliance obligations are not determinable at this time.
Greenhouse Gases. In December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of GHGs are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings provide the basis for the EPA to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. In June 2010, the EPA began regulating GHG emissions from stationary sources, including LNG terminals. In June 2019, the EPA issued the final Affordable Clean Energy rule, which, among other things, establishes emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The Affordable Clean Energy rule was subject to legal challenges and, in January 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the rule and remanded the rule to the EPA for revision or replacement. 
The Biden Administration has communicated its intention to address climate change and has issued Executive Orders with respect to certain governmental actions related to climate change. In the future, the EPA may promulgate additional regulations for sources of GHG emissions that could affect the oil and gas sector, and Congress or states may enact new GHG legislation, either of which could impose emission limits on the Driftwood Project or related pipelines or require the Driftwood Project or related pipelines to implement additional pollution control technologies, pay fees related to GHG emissions or implement mitigation measures. The scope and effects of any new laws or regulations are difficult to predict, and the impact of such laws or regulations on the Driftwood Project or related pipelines cannot be predicted at this time.
Coastal Zone Management Act. Certain aspects of the Driftwood terminal are subject to the requirements of the CZMA. The CZMA is administered by the states (in Louisiana, by the Department of Natural Resources). This program is implemented to ensure that impacts to coastal areas are consistent with the intent of the CZMA to manage the coastal areas. Certain facilities that are part of the Driftwood Project obtained permits for construction and operation in coastal areas pursuant to the requirements of the CZMA.
Clean Water Act. The Driftwood Project and related pipelines are subject to the CWA and analogous state and local laws. The CWA and analogous state and local laws regulate discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States or waters of the state, including discharges of wastewater and storm water runoff and discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, as well as spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements. Permits must be obtained prior to discharging pollutants into state and federal waters or dredging or filling wetland and coastal areas. The CWA is administered by the EPA, the USACE and by the states. Additionally, the siting and construction of the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline will impact jurisdictional wetlands, which would require appropriate federal, state and/or local permits and approval prior to impacting such wetlands. The authorizing agency may impose significant direct or indirect mitigation costs to compensate for regulated impacts to wetlands. Although the CWA permits required for construction and operation of the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline have been obtained, other CWA permits may be required in connection with our projects that are under development and our future projects. The approval timeframe may also be longer than expected and could potentially affect project schedules.
In April 2020, the EPA and the USACE finalized a rule revising and narrowing the definition of “waters of the United States” and replacing prior rules defining the same issued in 1986 and 2015 (the “2020 Rule”). On August 30, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona vacated and remanded the 2020 Rule and in June 2021, the EPA and the Department of the Army announced their intention to initiate a new rulemaking process to restore the pre-2015 definition of “waters of the United States” informed by decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. The proposed rule was published on December 7, 2021 and the comment period closed on February 7, 2022. In addition, in January 2022, the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari in a case, Sackett v. EPA, that could further impact this rulemaking process and the ultimate rule. Changes in the definition of “waters of the United States” are not likely to affect the permits already obtained for the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline, but further regulatory changes or any judicial decisions could affect other elements of the Driftwood terminal and Driftwood pipeline or other related pipelines in ways that cannot be predicted at this time.
Federal laws including the CWA require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil and produced water to prepare and implement spill prevention, control, countermeasure and response plans addressing the possible discharge of oil into surface waters. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) subjects owners and operators of facilities to strict and joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from oil spills, including the government’s response costs. Spills subject to the OPA may result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities. The 
Driftwood Project incorporates appropriate equipment and operational measures to reduce the potential for spills of oil and establish protocols for responding to spills, but oil spills remain an operational risk that could adversely affect our operations and result in additional costs or fines or penalties.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal RCRA and comparable state requirements govern the generation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and require corrective action for releases into the environment. In the event such wastes are generated or used in connection with our facilities, we will be subject to regulatory requirements affecting the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of such wastes and could be required to perform corrective action measures to clean up releases of such wastes. The EPA and certain environmental groups entered into an agreement pursuant to which the EPA was required to propose, no later than March 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. In April 2019, the EPA determined that revision of the regulations is not necessary. Information comprising the EPA’s review and the decision is contained in a document entitled “Management of Exploration, Development and Production Wastes: Factors Informing a Decision on the Need for Regulatory Action.” The EPA indicated that it would continue to work with states and other organizations to identify areas for continued improvement and to address emerging issues to ensure that exploration, development and production wastes continue to be managed in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment. Environmental groups, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the EPA’s decision and will likely continue to press the issue at the federal and state levels. A loss of the exclusion from RCRA coverage for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes in the future could result in a significant increase in our costs to manage and dispose of waste associated with our production operations.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). CERCLA, often referred to as Superfund, and comparable state statutes, impose liability that is generally joint and several and that is retroactive for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, for the release of a “hazardous substance” (or under state law, other specified substances) into the environment. So-called potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) include the current and certain past owners and operators of a facility where there has been a release or threat of release of a hazardous substance and persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of, or transported hazardous substances found at a site. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the PRPs the cost of such action. Liability can arise from conditions on properties where operations are conducted, even under circumstances where such operations were performed by third parties and/or from conditions at disposal facilities where materials were sent. Our operations involve the use or handling of materials that include or may be classified as hazardous substances under CERCLA or regulated under similar state statutes. We may also be the owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released and may be responsible for the investigation, management and disposal of soils or dredge spoils containing hazardous substances in connection with our operations.
Oil and natural gas exploration and production, and possibly other activities, have been conducted at some of our properties by previous owners and operators. Materials from these operations remain on some of the properties and in certain instances may require remediation. In some instances, we have agreed to indemnify the sellers of producing properties from whom we have acquired reserves against certain liabilities for environmental claims associated with the properties. Accordingly, we could incur material costs for remediation required under CERCLA or similar state statutes in the future.
Hydraulic Fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is commonly used to stimulate the production of crude oil and/or natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations. We plan to use hydraulic fracturing extensively in our natural gas development operations. The process involves the injection of water, sand, and additives under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation. The water and pressure create fractures in the rock formations which are held open by the grains of sand, enabling the natural gas to more easily flow to the wellbore. The process is generally subject to regulation by state oil and natural gas commissions but is also subject to new and changing regulatory programs at the federal, state and local levels.
In February 2014, the EPA issued permitting guidance under the Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”) for the underground injection of liquids from hydraulically fractured wells and other wells where diesel is used. Depending upon how it is implemented, this guidance may create duplicative requirements in certain areas, further slow the permitting process in certain areas, increase the costs of operations, and result in expanded regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities related to the Driftwood Project.
In May 2014, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) pursuant to which it will collect extensive information on the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing fluid, as well as other health-related data, from chemical manufacturers and processors. If the EPA regulates hydraulic fracturing fluid under TSCA in the future, such regulation may increase the cost of our natural gas development operations and the feedstock for the Driftwood terminal.
In June 2016, the EPA finalized pretreatment standards for indirect discharges of wastewater from the oil and natural gas extraction industry. The regulation prohibits sending wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works. Certain activities of our Business are subject to the pretreatment standards, which means that we are required to use disposal methods that may require additional permits or cost more to implement than disposal at publicly-owned treatment works.
In December 2016, the EPA released a report titled “Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States.” The report concluded that activities involved in hydraulic fracturing can have impacts on drinking water under certain circumstances. In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy has investigated practices that the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods. These and similar studies, depending on their degree of development and nature of results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms. If the EPA proposes additional regulations of hydraulic fracturing in the future, they could impose additional emission limits and pollution control technology requirements, which could limit our operations and revenues and potentially increase our costs of gas production or acquisition.
Endangered Species Act (“ESA”). Our operations may be restricted by requirements under the ESA. The ESA prohibits the harassment, harming or killing of certain protected species and destruction of protected habitats. Under the NEPA review process conducted by FERC, we have been and will be required to consult with federal agencies to determine limitations on and mitigation measures applicable to activities that have the potential to result in harm to threatened or endangered species of plants, animals, fish and their designated habitats. Although we have conducted studies and engaged in consultations with agencies in order to avoid harming protected species, inadvertent or incidental harm may occur in connection with the construction or operation of our properties, including of the Driftwood Project or related pipelines, which could result in fines or penalties. In addition, if threatened or endangered species are found on any part of our properties, including the sites of the Driftwood Project, related pipelines, or pipeline rights of way, then we may be required to implement avoidance or mitigation measures that could limit our operations or impose additional costs.
Regulation of Natural Gas Operations
Our natural gas operations are subject to a number of additional laws, rules and regulations that require, among other things, permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. States, parishes and municipalities in which we operate may regulate, among other things:
•the location of new wells;
•the method of drilling, completing and operating wells;
•the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;
•the plugging and abandoning of wells;
•notice to surface owners and other third parties; and
•produced water and waste disposal.
State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states, including Louisiana, allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and require that oil and natural gas be produced in a prorated, equitable system. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, most states generally impose a production, ad valorem or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil and natural gas within their jurisdictions. Many local authorities also impose an ad valorem tax on the minerals in place. States do not generally regulate wellhead prices or engage in other, similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance they will not do so in the future.
Anti-Corruption, Trade Control, and Tax Evasion Laws
We are subject to anti-corruption laws in various jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and other anti-corruption laws. The FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit our employees, directors, officers and agents from authorizing, offering, or providing improper payments or anything else of value to government officials or other covered persons to obtain or retain business or gain an improper business advantage. We face the risk that one of our employees or agents will offer, authorize, or provide something of value that could subject us to liability under the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect 
of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.
We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and various non-U.S. government entities, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements, currency exchange regulations, and transfer pricing regulations (collectively, “Trade Control laws”).
We are also subject to new U.K. corporate criminal offenses for failure to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion pursuant to the Criminal Finances Act 2017, which imposes criminal liability on a company where it has failed to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion by a person associated with the company.
We have instituted policies, procedures and ongoing training of employees designed to ensure that we and our employees and agents comply with the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws, Trade Control laws and the Criminal Finances Act 2017. However, there is no assurance that our efforts have been and will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA or other legal requirements. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws, the Trade Control laws or the Criminal Finances Act 2017, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws the Trade Control laws or the Criminal Finances Act 2017 by the U.S. or foreign authorities could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. U.S. or foreign authorities may also seek to hold us liable for successor liability for anti-corruption violations committed by companies we acquire or in which we invest (for example, by way of acquiring equity interests, participating as a joint venture partner, or acquiring assets).
Competition
We are subject to a high degree of competition in all aspects of our business. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business in General — Competition is intense in the energy industry and some of Tellurian’s competitors have greater financial, technological and other resources.”
Production & Transportation. The natural gas and oil business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of reserves, the acquisition of natural gas and oil leases, equipment and personnel required to develop and produce reserves, and the gathering, transportation and marketing of natural gas and oil. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated natural gas and oil companies, other independent natural gas and oil companies, and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial, and individual consumers, such as operators of pipelines and other midstream facilities. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger staffs and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we currently possess.
Liquefaction. The Driftwood terminal will compete with liquefaction facilities worldwide to supply low-cost liquefaction to the market. There are a number of liquefaction facilities worldwide that we compete with for customers. Many of the companies with which we compete have greater name recognition, larger staffs and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
LNG Marketing. Tellurian competes with a variety of companies in the global LNG market, including (i) integrated energy companies that market LNG from their own liquefaction facilities, (ii) trading houses and aggregators with LNG supply portfolios, and (iii) liquefaction plant operators that market equity volumes. Many of the companies with which we compete have greater name recognition, larger staffs, greater access to the LNG market and substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. 
Title to Properties
With respect to our natural gas producing properties, we believe that we hold good and defensible leasehold title to substantially all of our properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry. A preliminary title examination is conducted at the time the properties are acquired. Our natural gas properties are subject to royalty, overriding royalty, and other outstanding interests. We believe that we hold good title to our other properties, subject to customary burdens, liens, or encumbrances that we do not expect to materially interfere with our use of the properties. 
Major Customers
We do not have any major customers.
Facilities
Certain subsidiaries of Tellurian have entered into operating leases for office space in Houston, Texas, and Washington, D.C. The tenors of the leases are five and eight years for Houston and Washington, D.C., respectively. 
Employees and Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, Tellurian had 107 full-time employees worldwide. None of them are subject to collective bargaining arrangements. The Company’s workforce is primarily located in Houston, Texas, and we have offices in Louisiana, Washington DC, London and Singapore. Many of our employees are originally from, or have extensive experience working in, countries other than the United States. This reflects our overall strategy of building a natural gas business that is global in scope. 
We plan to build, among other things, an LNG liquefaction facility that we believe is one of the largest energy infrastructure projects currently under development in the United States. Given the inherent challenges involved in the construction of a project of this type, in particular by a company that has limited current operations, our human resources strategy focuses on the recruitment and retention of employees who have already established relevant expertise in the industry. The execution of this strategy has resulted in us assembling what we believe to be a premier management team in the global natural gas and LNG industry. A related aspect of our human resources strategy is that the compensation structure for many of our employees is weighted towards incentive compensation that is designed to reward progress toward the development of our business, including in particular the financing and construction of the Driftwood Project.
Jurisdiction and Year of Formation
The Company is a Delaware corporation originally formed in 1967 and formerly known as Magellan Petroleum Corporation.
