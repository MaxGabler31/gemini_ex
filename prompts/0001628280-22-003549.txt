ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview of Our Company 
We are an autonomous technology company that is revolutionizing the estimated $4 trillion global truck freight market. We have developed autonomous technology specifically designed for semi-trucks, which has enabled us to be the first company to autonomously operate semi-trucks without a driver or human operator on open public roads (“Driver Out” operation). Our technology has allowed us to build the first Autonomous Freight Network (“AFN”) in partnership with shippers, carriers, railroads, freight brokers, fleet asset owners, and truck hardware partners. 
Since our founding in 2015, we have developed a fully integrated software and hardware solution enabling Level 4 (“L4”) driver-out autonomous semi-truck technology. Hallmarks of our proprietary semi-truck specific technology include our 1,000 meter perception range, 35 second planning horizon, high definition (“HD”) maps with accuracy within five centimeters, an integrated L4 autonomous semi-truck design comprising of a fully redundant sensor suite, an Autonomous Domain Controller (“ADC”) on-board computing solution, and other components. Long-range perception, advanced planning and decision-making, and highly accurate mapping are critical capabilities for the autonomous operation of semi-trucks, which are heavy, articulated vehicles that need to be able to operate at highway speeds. We believe that our technology and our AFN will make long haul trucking significantly safer as well as more reliable, efficient and environmentally friendly, creating significant benefits for all who rely on the freight ecosystem to deliver essential goods. 
We are focused specifically on the truck freight market, which is a large and essential industry that moves approximately 80% of the freight in the United States by revenue. E-commerce trends such as same day shipping are expected to further accelerate demand for truck freight and strain traditional freight providers’ ability to supply sufficient capacity dynamically and cost effectively. Currently, trucking is facing substantial challenges in several areas including safety, efficiency, and carbon footprint, which we believe cannot be fully addressed without significant technological innovation.
Driver Out Operations. In December 2021, we commenced Driver Out runs on an 80+ mile freight route in Arizona, covering surface streets, on-ramps, off-ramps and highways. We plan to continue our runs on this route, systematically expanding the operational design domain (“ODD”) in which our Driver Out semi-trucks operate and expanding Driver Out runs to new routes in the southern U.S. including hauling Driver Out customer freight. We believe that commencing Driver Out runs is a significant proof point in our technology development and a necessary step to building a scalable autonomous trucking solution.
Ecosystem of Global Partnerships That Will Help Us Scale. We have created an ecosystem of partners consisting of Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs"), Tier 1 components suppliers, shippers, carriers, railroads, freight brokers, fleet asset owners, and third party service providers that we believe will de-risk commercialization of the AFN, enable rapid adoption of our autonomous freight solution, and allow us to build an attractive, network-based business model. 
We have partnered with a leading commercial vehicle OEM, TRATON Group ("TRATON®") and specifically with its Navistar and Scania semi-truck brands, to build a purpose-built L4 autonomous semi-truck to be operated on our network. We also have partnered with a diverse group of leading global hardware components suppliers and are developing in partnership with NVIDIA® the first vertically integrated ADC computing solution for an L4 semi-truck. We believe that this collaborative approach to create semi-trucks designed and built with integrated auto-grade components and sensors will increase our AFN’s reliability at scale. Vertically integrating through partnerships with OEMs and Tier 1 component suppliers also allows us to maintain strong supply chain and hardware design control while remaining capital light and primarily focusing on developing proprietary autonomous technology. 
In parallel, we have developed an ecosystem of shippers, carriers, railroads, freight brokers, fleet asset owners, and third party service providers, including UPS®, McLane®, U.S. Xpress®, Werner®, Schneider®, Ryder®, DHL®, Union Pacific®, and CN®, that provide critical validation and enhance the network effect benefits of our approach. We believe that our partnership network creates a significant and sustainable competitive advantage, especially as we work with shippers, carriers, and railroads to strategically locate our AFN terminals near their distribution centers. The continued growth of our AFN infrastructure and partnerships will continue to improve our user experience and drive more users to our platform which will allow us to further densify our strategic terminal network and reinforce rapid network growth.

Transformative Benefits for Industry Stakeholders. Our AFN leverages our proprietary L4 autonomous semi-trucks, HD digital route mapping capabilities, and TuSimple Connect cloud-based autonomous operations oversight system to provide substantial benefits to the key truck freight industry stakeholders. The “plug and play” nature of our solution will allow any truck freight market participant to access and benefit from our autonomous freight capacity. Shippers, carriers, and railroads gain access to reliable and safe freight capacity at a substantially lower annual total cost of ownership when direct labor is removed from the per mile cost structure. Additionally, our solution can deliver over 10% better fuel efficiency than traditional trucking through optimized truck control and driving operations which can deliver a measurable reduction in carbon emissions, based on a study conducted with the University of California San Diego and empirical data from our users. Removing the driver from long haul operations allows shippers, carriers, and railroads to reallocate scarce driver resources to customer facing first and last mile routes. In addition, our L4 semi-trucks are not currently limited by industry hours-of-service rules that apply for human drivers, which will allow our trucks to operate for more than 20 hours per day, which is a differentiating capability versus a single driver human-operated truck. Freight brokers will be able to benefit from the reliability of autonomy, which allows them to match demand more efficiently with the lowest cost long haul freight capacity. We believe that the wide ranging benefits of our solution to industry participants will accelerate the adoption of our network.
Our Go-to-Market Strategies 
In the United States, we plan two primary business models for our AFN:
Carrier-Owned Capacity. Many of our users prefer to own all or a substantial portion of their semi-truck fleet. Our Carrier-owned Capacity model is expected to allow users to seamlessly integrate autonomous freight operations into their existing supply chain. Users will pay TuSimple a per mile subscription fee to operate their purpose-built L4 autonomous semi-truck and receive the full benefit of our AFN, including autonomy-enabled routes mapped directly to users’ existing facilities and TuSimple Connect platform. 
TuSimple Capacity. Access to our full service autonomous freight capacity as a service is available to our users through our TuSimple Capacity model. We utilize a capital light business model, financing our L4 autonomous semi-trucks through third party fleet asset owners and financing sources. This model provides us with control of operational logistics and user experience as we offer a seamless terminal to terminal freight service to our users. Our users pay for access to our L4 autonomous semi-trucks operating across our AFN on a per mile basis. 
Additionally, we plan to build purpose-built autonomous trucking solutions specifically for the Europe and China markets with our OEM partner TRATON. We believe that our expansion in both regions will augment and complement our AFN commercialization in the United States. 
Our Core Technologies 
Proprietary Perception and Sensor System. Our proprietary perception and sensor system is critical to our L4 autonomous semi-trucks’ perception range and accuracy. Our perception system is powered by proprietary artificial intelligence technology and, when coupled with our proprietary camera module, enables the semi-truck’s 1,000 meter perception range, even in low light conditions. This range across lighting environments is designed to provide our semi-trucks with sufficient reaction time to safely operate at highway speeds, ultimately allowing for a planning horizon up to 35 seconds. Our camera-centric system is powered by both primary and backup cameras, providing a fully redundant camera system for increased safety. Augmenting the camera perception is an array of LiDAR, radar systems, GPS, and ultrasonic sensors. Our combined use of cameras and sensors provides our semi-trucks with superior perception range, while also being highly accurate in different road scenarios. With the exception of our specially designed long range high definition camera, we have sourced the balance of our sensor suite from existing third party products in order to reduce the cost of the overall system. 
Motion Planning. Our innovative motion planning software complements our proprietary perception and sensor system by predicting the future paths of surrounding vehicles. Due to our long range perception technology that allows us to accurately capture the road environment up to 1,000 meters ahead, we have over 35 seconds of planning horizon. By utilizing prediction models which assess vehicle speeds and driver intent, we can plan better and safer driving trajectories for our semi-trucks. We believe that our systems’ ability to accurately forecast the behavior of compliant and non-compliant drivers is highly differentiated and will significantly increase the safety of our purpose-built L4 autonomous semi-trucks relative to human drivers. 
Control. Our control algorithms receive input from the motion planning module to put into action a safe and efficient driving trajectory. These algorithms must be designed specifically for the semi-truck use case, as semi-trucks are significantly less nimble than passenger cars, with characteristics including longer gear shift timeframes and the need for higher actuation accuracy. 
Machine Learning Infrastructure. The accuracy of our perception and motion planning capabilities is augmented by our proprietary machine learning algorithms. Over the course of over 6 million road miles, we have accumulated a vast set of semi-truck specific driving data with which to train our perception and motion planning capabilities. We focus our data collection and storage efforts on both quality and quantity. This enables our database to be informative and relatively easily analyzed by our machine learning software which currently has the capacity to process 100,000 instances per day. This data analysis trains our software to more accurately predict how the surrounding environment of a semi-truck will change in real time. 
HD Mapping. We believe that integrated mapping software with rapid updating is crucial for the operation of an L4 autonomous semi-truck. Our AFN is comprised of HD digital maps of the major freight corridors over which our semi-trucks operate. Our proprietary mapping technology provides us significant control to map the routes on which we operate, with the level of detail we require and update the maps rapidly. Our proprietary maps are developed by driving camera, LiDAR and GPS equipped commercial vehicles along the target freight route several times. This data collection is followed by fully automated processing which fine tunes and generates full 3D high definition maps at an accuracy of five centimeters or less. 
Autonomous Domain Controller. We have partnered with NVIDIA, a leading graphical computing technology company, to develop a proprietary ADC computing solution. The ADC is a central on-board computer that is being designed to execute hundreds of trillions of operations per second for our autonomous driving system, including our perception, planning and control systems. The ADC will incorporate NVIDIA’s Orin System-on-Chip hardware and our autonomous driving software and algorithms. We and NVIDIA plan to develop the ADC for use in our production semi-trucks. We believe the ADC will be a powerful, scalable computing solution specifically engineered to the requirements of our autonomous driving system. 
Proprietary HD Mapping Capability. Our in-house mapping technology can quickly map new routes and provide users with more location options for shipping on our AFN. Our proprietary mapping technology and process is accurate to within five centimeters. Precise localization accuracy is crucial to safely operate semi-trucks autonomously given the 8.5 foot average tractor width, particularly when travelling on local streets which average just 10 feet wide. We also have the ability to update our maps quickly, allowing new roadway conditions experienced by one of our semi-trucks to be uploaded on our HD maps and shared with the rest of the fleet rapidly. This nimble, flexible approach is expected to provide operational efficiency and enhanced safety, while meeting our users’ evolving freight demands and efficiently expanding our network.
Cloud-Based Operational and Monitoring System. Our seamless user experience will be enhanced by our proprietary TuSimple Connect system. This cloud-based autonomous operations oversight system is designed to ensure safe operations, reliability, and efficient capacity for our users. The system will directly connect to our users’ Transportation Management Systems, integrating TuSimple Connect into their supply chain and creating a close user relationship. Our users will be able to book and track their freight seamlessly with real-time two way communication that allows our AFN to dynamically match freight supply with demand. 
Our TRATON Partnership
We have a global partnership with TRATON, a publicly listed subsidiary of Volkswagen. TRATON is one of the world’s largest commercial truck OEMs with truck brands including Scania, Navistar (which produces the “International” brand of trucks), MAN Truck & Bus and Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus. We initially established independent partnerships with Navistar and TRATON in 2020. In July 2021, TRATON merged with Navistar and it became a wholly owned subsidiary of TRATON.
We are working with TRATON and its brands to develop a line of purpose-built L4 autonomous semi-trucks. In North America, we are continuing to partner with Navistar under a Joint Development Agreement to collaboratively develop a purpose-built L4 autonomous semi-truck. As part of this partnership, we have also negotiated with Navistar terms for a production license agreement to commercially market and provide services for autonomous trucks thereafter. The product development process will follow a stage gate development model for the production of purpose-built L4 autonomous semi-trucks. We are providing the software, system design, and requirements for the autonomous truck while Navistar serves as the system integrator for the truck hardware and is responsible for validation and testing.
In Europe and China, we work with TRATON’s Scania brand on autonomous technology development including a L4 autonomous trucking pilot program on a hub-to-hub truck freight route in Sweden.
We believe our partnership with TRATON allows us to primarily focus on our technology development on our proprietary core autonomous driving system technologies, while gaining the benefits of capital light vertical integration. 
Our Operations Today
We currently operate approximately 100 L4 autonomous semi-trucks with approximately 75 operating in the U.S. and 25 in China. We have commenced Driver Out runs in Arizona on a more than 80 mile freight route, covering surface streets, on-ramps, off-ramps and highways. The runs are conducted on an actual freight route between a railyard in Tucson, AZ, and a high-volume distribution center in the Phoenix metro area. Our vehicles interact with traffic, change lanes at highway speeds, navigate intersections and traffic signals, and handle complex road situations such as emergency lane vehicles.
In addition, we operate L4 autonomous semi-trucks with a safety driver and safety engineer in the cabin (“Driver In”), both in testing operations and in commercial operations where we haul paid freight for customers. Operating with a safety driver and safety engineer allows us to continually improve our L4 technology. We aim to scale Driver Out operations to be an increasing percentage of our overall operations. 
We also haul paid freight for customers in manual mode with a human driver operating the vehicle. We believe this is beneficial to build our long-term customer relationships for our AFN. We aim to continue increasing the penetration of autonomous operations on our AFN over time. 
Government Regulation 
We believe that the current regulatory environment exhibits a clear path for L4 autonomous semi-trucks to deploy nationwide and that working collaboratively with regulators and ecosystem partners will create a safer freight industry. The U.S. Department of Transportation has stated that “the United States Government is committed to fostering surface transportation innovations to ensure the United States leads the world in automated vehicle (AV) technology development and integration while prioritizing safety, security and privacy and safeguarding the freedoms enjoyed by Americans.” Today, 44 states allow autonomous semi-truck testing, of which 26 states allow autonomous semi-truck commercial deployment. We believe that the current regulatory environment exhibits a clear path toward autonomous trucking solutions nationwide and that regulators will be our partners in creating a new, drastically safer freight industry. 
At the federal level in the United States, the safety of commercial motor vehicles is regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation through two federal Agencies – the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the “NHTSA”) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (the “FMCSA”). NHTSA establishes the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (the “FMVSS”) for motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment and oversees the actions that manufacturers of motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment are required to take regarding the reporting of information related to defects or injuries related to their products and the recall and repair of vehicles and equipment that contain safety defects or fail to comply with the FMVSS. FMCSA regulates the safety of commercial motor carriers operating in interstate commerce, the qualifications and safety of commercial motor vehicle drivers, and the safe operation of commercial trucks. 
While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations expressly pertaining to the safety of autonomous driving systems for trucks, the U.S. Department of Transportation has established recommended voluntary guidelines, and NHTSA and FMCSA have authority to take enforcement action should an automated driving system pose an unreasonable risk to safety or inhibit the safe operation of a commercial motor vehicle. Certain U.S. states have legal restrictions on autonomous driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This patchwork increases the legal complexity for our purpose-built autonomous trucks. In Europe, certain vehicle safety regulations apply to self-driving braking and steering systems, and certain treaties also restrict the legality of certain higher levels of autonomous driving vehicles. Autonomous driving laws and regulations are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and foreign countries and may create restrictions on autonomous driving features that we develop. 
As the trucks that carry our technology go into production, we are subject to existing stringent requirements overseen by NHTSA under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the “Vehicle Safety Act”), including a duty to report, subject to strict timing requirements, safety defects with our products. The Vehicle Safety Act imposes potentially significant civil penalties for violations including the failure to comply with such reporting actions. We are also subject to the existing U.S. Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act (the “TREAD Act”), which requires motor vehicle equipment manufacturers, such as us, to comply with “Early Warning” requirements by reporting certain information to NHTSA, such as information related to defects or reports of injury related to our products. The TREAD Act imposes criminal liability for violating such requirements if a defect subsequently causes death or bodily injury. 
In addition, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act authorizes NHTSA to require a manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles that contain safety defects or fail to comply with U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standards. Sales into foreign countries may be subject to similar regulations. As the development of federal and state regulation of autonomous machines and vehicles continues to evolve, we may be subject to additional regulatory schemes. 
In addition, our operations are subject to various international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing pollution and protection of the environment, the use, generation, storage, management, discharge, transportation, disposal, and release of, and human exposure to, hazardous and toxic materials, and the occupational health and safety of our employees. Our truck drivers and trucking operations are subject to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (the “FMCSRs”) established by FMCSA, and we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), and comparable international, state, and local laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety. 
In order for us to operate in international markets outside the U.S., we must comply with relevant legal regulations regarding autonomous vehicles as well as technology export control, data security, cybersecurity and other related regulations that apply to global technology companies. We have developed robust compliance processes and procedures related to these regulatory requirements and believe that we are in compliance with such requirements. We do not believe there are any regulatory restrictions that would materially restrict our ability to operate in our key markets of the U.S., China or Europe. We are in regular dialogue with the relevant regulatory policy bodies globally and will continue to comply with these regulations or any updates thereof. 
Research and Development 
We have invested a significant amount of time and effort into research and development of proprietary artificial intelligence, algorithms, and software to solidify our technology leadership in the market. Our ability to maintain this leadership position depends in part on our ongoing research and development activities. Our research and development team is responsible for the design, development, and testing of our technology.
Our research and development is largely conducted at our headquarters in San Diego, California. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,100 full time employees engaged in our research and development activities. We expect research and development expense to increase over future years as we continue to develop our L4 autonomous semi-truck technology.
Intellectual Property 
Our ability to be at the forefront of innovation in the autonomous trucking and freight transport market largely depends on our ability to obtain, maintain, and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights relating to our key technology, and our ability to successfully enforce these rights against third parties. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets (including know-how), in addition to employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, intellectual property licenses, and other contractual rights. Our success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, and in part, on our ability to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating our intellectual property and proprietary rights. A comprehensive discussion on risks relating to intellectual property is provided under the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property, Information Technology, and Data Privacy.” 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 387 issued patents and 763 pending patent applications globally, including 130 issued patents in the United States and various counterpart patents in China. Our patents in the United States expire between February 2035 and September 2039, and our patents in China expire between November 2026 and February 2039. Our issued patents and patent applications cover a broad range of system level and component level aspects of autonomous technology, and we intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology. 
Competition
We view ourselves as a partner to the key stakeholders in the traditional truck freight industry rather than a competitor. We believe that our AFN solution will address the key supply and demand pain points faced by the industry today and that our technology will make truck freight shipper and carrier operations significantly safer and more efficient. We believe that our partnerships with well-established industry participants validates this collaborative approach.
Despite our partnership approach, we face significant competition from traditional freight carriers and shippers. The truck freight industry is fragmented and highly competitive, historically leading to pricing pressure and low operating margins. We will compete with traditional carriers on reliability, price, and safety. We believe that our technology provides us with a significant advantage across each of these key competitive areas.
While we face technological competition from other autonomous vehicle companies, we believe that our exclusive focus on the semi-truck use case differentiates us from other autonomous vehicle companies. L4 autonomous semi-trucks present distinct challenges relative to autonomous passenger vehicles, and we believe that overlap in technological capabilities is limited. We also believe that our lead in solved semi-truck autonomy edge cases, extensive patent portfolio, and well-established industry partnerships further strengthen our leadership position.
Our People and Culture
We pride ourselves on the talent, passion, and dedication of our employees, who are united in our goal to revolutionize the global freight market. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,400 full-time employees. The majority of our employees are based in San Diego, California, with others located in other states and internationally.
We have built a values-based culture that emphasizes values such as striving for excellence, transparency, and support for each other. Our employees have access to development stipends, a wide range of training, different career paths, and, most importantly, challenging and purposeful work. Our culture is also built on diversity, inclusion, camaraderie, and celebration. We organize regular cultural events, teambuilding activities and public recognition forums to celebrate our diversity and invest in strong relationships.
Apart from culture and career development, we offer a robust benefits package. This package includes vacation days, paid parental leave, 401(k), performance bonuses, and a premier health plan for employees and their dependents. We also regularly survey and host roundtables with our employees to better understand their needs and perspectives, and, as a result of these discussions, we have added benefits including conference funds, fitness stipends, teambuilding budgets, and pet insurance.
