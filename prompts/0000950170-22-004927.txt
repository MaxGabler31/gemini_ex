 Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of novel and proprietary small molecule drugs that employ the body’s natural mechanisms to selectively degrade therapeutically-relevant proteins, so called molecular glue degraders or “MGDs”. We have developed a proprietary protein degradation platform, called QuEEN (an abbreviation for “Quantitative and Engineered Elimination of Neosubstrates”), to enable our target-centric approach to our MGD discovery and development. Our QuEEN platform enables us to rapidly identify protein targets and associated MGD product candidates that are designed to specifically eliminate therapeutically-relevant proteins. We believe our MGDs provide significant advantages over existing therapeutic modalities, including other protein degradation approaches, by allowing us to broadly target proteins otherwise considered undruggable or inadequately drugged. To date, our QuEEN platform has identified thousands of proteins for potential targeting using our MGDs. Many of these are highly credentialed targets, and at least 75% of those targets would be otherwise considered undruggable. Identified targets are recorded in our Degron encyclopedia, described below, for analysis using our artificial intelligence (“AI”) platforms and for potential MGD design and development. Incorporating insights and expertise we gain from QuEEN, we are building our proprietary MGD library. Our library is composed of a diverse set of rationally designed small molecules currently representing more than 400 unique low molecular weight scaffolds. We focus our product development on therapeutic targets backed by strong biological and genetic rationale with the goal of discovering and developing novel medicines. These opportunities include oncology and non-oncology indications, including immunology, inflammation, neurological and genetic diseases. Our most advanced product candidate, MRT-2359, is an orally bioavailable degrader of the translation termination factor protein GSPT1 currently in development for use in Myc-driven tumors. Our novel strategy for MRT-2359 is based on our previously unreported observation of a functional association between GSPT1 and the Myc family of transcription factors. We have shown that through this association, GSPT1 serves as a key regulator and vulnerability of Myc-induced protein translation in certain Myc-driven tumors. We plan to submit an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for MRT-2359 in mid-2022. Beyond GSPT1, our NEK7 and CDK2 programs are now in lead optimization and we continue to advance those programs towards development candidate selection. Our pipeline further includes multiple additional discovery phase programs that we continue to advance through development.
Our proprietary QuEEN platform uniquely enables us to rationally design and develop our diverse library of small molecule MGDs against an identified pool of target proteins, many of which are considered inadequately drugged or otherwise undruggable. Our MGDs are drug-like small molecules that currently bring together a therapeutically-relevant target protein and an E3 ligase, known as cereblon, leading to degradation of the target protein via the intracellular protein degradation system, called the proteasome. Our MGDs are non-heterobifunctional, in contrast to proteolysis targeting chimeras, or PROTACs. Central to our QuEEN platform is a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions promoted by our small molecule MGDs between E3 ligases and structural features, called degrons, on the surface of therapeutically-relevant proteins. Key components of our QuEEN platform are:
•Proprietary MGD library: A wholly-owned, proprietary diverse and continuously growing chemical library of currently around 20,000 drug-like MGDs that we have rationally designed based on our growing expertise in molecular glue anatomy. Library compounds currently represent more than 400 unique low molecular weight scaffolds with favorable binding affinities for the E3 ubiquitin ligase cereblon, and representing ever increasing chemical diversity.
 •Degron encyclopedia: A growing proprietary database of degrons and associated target proteins identified through our experimental platform as well as our proprietary artificial intelligence approaches that enables us to determine structural features on protein surfaces that can serve as degrons or other points of interaction between an E3 ligase and a therapeutically-relevant protein. Our Degron encyclopedia encompasses multiple degron classes spanning diverse protein domains and families and representing a broad disease landscape.
 •Glueomics toolbox: A specialized and tailored suite of biochemical, structural biology, cellular, proteomics and in silico tools that enable and accelerate the discovery and optimization of MGD product candidates that efficiently recruit neosubstrates to E3 ligases utilizing degrons discovered through our experimental platform and AI approach. 

   Our lead candidate, MRT-2359, is an orally bioavailable degrader of the translation termination factor protein GSPT1 in development initially for use in the treatment of cancers overexpressing one of the Myc family genes (c-Myc, N-Myc and L-Myc). The Myc transcription factors are some of the most frequently mutated, translocated and overexpressed oncogenes in human cancers. For example, we estimate 15% of non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and over 50% of small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, overexpress L- or N-Myc. Myc-driven cancer cells are highly addicted to protein translation. Because of the key role of GSPT1 in protein synthesis, we have shown that selective GSPT1 degradation by MRT-2359 in these cells leads to cell death. In multiple Myc-driven preclinical models, we have shown that MRT-2359 is selective in potently degrading GSPT1 and inducing tumor regression after oral administration. We expect to submit an IND to the FDA in mid-2022.
 In addition to our GSPT1 program, our QuEEN platform has identified multiple additional pipeline and discovery stage programs drawn to multiple therapeutically-relevant, degron-containing target proteins otherwise considered undruggable or inadequately drugged. We have been able to identify selective MGD molecules for CDK2, an oncology target and key driver of cancers such as ovarian, uterine, and breast cancer. Our CDK2 program is currently in lead optimization. We have also identified potential targets outside of oncology as exemplified by our NEK7 program. NEK7 is a key component of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a central regulator of cellular inflammatory responses to pathogens, damage and stress. Aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases, including Crohn’s disease, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and liver diseases. Our NEK7 program is currently in lead optimization. We continue to progress our discovery stage programs, including VAV1, a target protein in autoimmune disease, BCL11A, a therapeutically-relevant protein in hemoglobinopathies, and multiple other currently undisclosed targets.
We have identified a large number of therapeutically-relevant targets that are amenable to degradation by the MGDs discovered and developed through our QuEEN platform. Applying our unique structural biology and computational tools encompassed by QuEEN, we have built and continue to grow an encyclopedia of thousands degron-containing proteins, many of which have links to human diseases. The majority of these proteins have been considered undruggable because they lack suitable small molecule binding pockets, which our MGDs do not require. We are systematically validating and rapidly advancing the most compelling of these targets while prioritizing those with a strong established therapeutic rationale for inclusion in our pipeline.
We are led by an experienced team of drug discovery and development experts with decades of experience in targeted protein degradation, molecular glues, chemistry, structural biology, data science, disease biology, translational medicine, and clinical development.

 Our product pipeline
We have leveraged our QuEEN platform to generate our pipeline of products with the potential to treat a diverse range of disease through targeted protein degradation. Our current programs are focused on delivering therapies to targets that have been considered undruggable or inadequately drugged in well-characterized biological pathways across clinical indications in oncology, inflammation, immunology and genetic diseases with high unmet needs. We currently retain worldwide rights to the programs shown in the Figure 1 below.
   Figure 1: Monte Rosa Pipeline; Rapidly Advancing Wholly-Owned MGD Programs Targeting Undruggable Proteins
 
Our strategy
Our mission is to reshape disease treatment paradigms by discovering and developing a portfolio of novel small molecule MGDs that selectively eliminate therapeutically-relevant proteins in a broad range of indications with significant unmet medical need.
We believe the product candidates identified through our proprietary QuEEN platform can provide distinct advantages over other modalities to address targets that have been considered undruggable or inadequately drugged. In order to achieve our mission, key elements of our strategy include:
•Continue to advance our GSPT1-directed MGD program into and through clinical development and seek regulatory approval. We employ a core set of drug discovery and development principles to guide our target protein selection across various protein classes and therapeutic areas. We are specifically focused on delivering therapies to targets that have been considered undruggable or inadequately drugged in preclinically and clinically well-characterized biological pathways. We have generated data in preclinical models that demonstrate the potential of our GSPT1-directed MGDs to confer antitumor activity across multiple tumor types that are driven by the Myc family of transcription factors. We expect to submit an IND for MRT-2359 in mid-2022 and to thereafter initiate our phase 1/2 clinical trial;
 •Develop a pipeline of rationally designed MGDs to transform the treatment of diseases in multiple therapeutic areas. Through our QuEEN platform, we have identified thousands of degron-containing proteins. Many of these proteins have been recognized as highly credentialed as potential therapeutic targets through preclinical and genetic studies. Further, at least 75% of the degron containing proteins identified in our encyclopedia are considered inaccessible or undruggable by existing drug modalities. We will continue to focus on therapeutic targets backed by strong biological and genetic rationale with the goal of producing novel precision medicines. These opportunities include oncology and non-oncology indications, including immunology and inflammation, neurological and genetic diseases. CDK2 and NEK7 are two examples of our success, and we are advancing those programs to candidate selection while continuing to advance our other programs into lead optimization; 
 •Further expand the capabilities of our QuEEN platform to unlock the full therapeutic potential of our MGDs. Our QuEEN platform enables us to vastly expand the degradable proteome beyond conventionally druggable targets. Our approach is based on the computational identification of structural features on the surface of a protein that render a target protein amenable to complex formation with an E3 ligase. We refer to such structures as degrons. We combine our QuEEN platform, including our AI-powered degron and target discovery engine, with our proprietary library of rationally designed MGDs to selectively connect degron-containing targets to E3 ligase proteins, including cereblon. QuEEN has the potential to help us better understand the optimal pairing of 

   degron-containing proteins with ligases to even further expand our target space. We will continue to invest in building our QuEEN platform, including expanding our proprietary MGD library as well as our proteomics, in silico screening, pharmacogenomics and translational medicine capabilities;
•Expand and protect our proprietary know-how and intellectual property. We continue to expand intellectual property around our innovations in the field of targeted protein degradation and in particular MGDs. Our intellectual property, which includes proprietary know-how, patent applications and expected patents, as well as trade secrets, applies to all of our various innovations not only to our product candidates but also, for example, to our drug discovery processes including our QuEEN platform, to our AI discovery engine algorithms, our Degron Encyclopedia, to our drug development tools, to our growing library of MGDs, and to the innovative methods and approaches we have developed to rationally design MGDs and to expand our library of MGDs, as well as to certain biomarkers and therapeutic applications for our potential product candidates; and
 •Consider strategic collaborations in select therapeutic areas to fully realize the potential of our QuEEN platform. Our goal is to become a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company that delivers pioneering therapies for patients. We currently retain all rights to our programs and platform. To support our goal, we will selectively explore strategic partnerships where we can leverage complementary capabilities in discovery, development and commercialization in disease areas within and outside our core areas of therapeutic focus to bring transformative therapies to patients with high unmet medical needs 
 Background on targeted protein degradation and molecular glues
Proteins are large, complex molecules that are involved in essentially all of the biochemical reactions that take place in the body. Many human diseases are associated with abnormal intracellular protein behavior driven by modified functional activation or inactivation of the protein itself. Given their critical role, proteins are attractive therapeutic targets, including those that act inside the cell and on its surface. While significant progress has been made in the development of therapeutics that address malfunctioning proteins, at least 75 % of human proteins are considered undruggable by traditional small molecules.
Challenges with druggable vs. undruggable proteins
The most common methods of targeting proteins, including intracellular proteins, involve traditional small molecule inhibitors that bind to a pocket in the protein and, there, act to inhibit or modify the function of the protein. Having such a pocket is what has traditionally led to a protein being considered druggable yet most proteins lack suitably sized and shaped binding pockets. In particular, proteins such as transcription factors, those that act as scaffolding for other proteins and modulators of enzyme activity, all of which can play a critical role in disease, often don’t have binding pockets suited for efficient ligand binding. The absence of a binding pocket presents a challenge to the development of traditional small molecule inhibitors. Furthermore, the features of therapeutic antibodies, oligo-based nucleotides and other genetic therapies limit their ability to address aberrant protein behavior.
Some of the aforementioned therapeutic modalities have meaningfully advanced the treatment of disease and improved the quality of life for millions of patients. However, these modalities face specific challenges related to their mode of delivery, scalability and their therapeutic application. A summary of these characteristics can be found in Figure 2.
   Figure 2: The Next Generation of Precision Medicine-Based Small Molecule Drugs; Selectively Editing the Human Proteome with Rationally Designed MGDs
 
Molecular glues: a new approach to protein degradation
A new and promising approach to modulating protein function using small molecules in cells was recently elucidated: protein degradation. Illustrated in Figure 3, protein degradation is one of the body’s natural processes by which proteins are eliminated from human cells through the attachment of a molecular tag, called ubiquitin, to a protein by any of the approximately 600 human E3 ligases, marking the protein for degradation by the proteasome in the cell. Protein degradation can be induced by small molecule-based degraders, including both PROTACs and MGDs. It was found that lenalidomide, now an approved best-selling drug in multiple indications with 2021 global sales of $12.8 billion, functioned as a small molecule-based degrader, or as an MGD, more specifically. In one of these indications, multiple myeloma, lenalidomide acts by causing two disease-driving transcription factors, IKZF1 and IKZF3, that lack druggable pockets, to bind to cereblon, an E3 ligase protein, resulting in their degradation. In this context, lenalidomide leads to the formation of a complex of IKZF1 and IKZF3 with cereblon by inducing surface complementarity between the components of the complex rather than by binding of the MGD into a succinct binding pocket on the protein target.
Figure 3: Overview of Protein Degradation

   We believe the targeted protein degradation approach offers many features that make it an attractive therapeutic modality:
•Removal of a target protein: partial or complete removal of a target protein can lead to more complete inhibition of signaling and metabolic pathways, thus resulting in more profound pharmacodynamic effects than traditional reversible or irreversible inhibition 
 •Intracellular protein targetability: small molecule-based protein degraders, in particular MGDs, readily cross cell membranes or can be optimized to do so 
 •Ease of delivery: small molecule-based protein degraders, in particular MGDs, can be delivered through various routes of administration, including oral
 •Systemic and tissue distribution: since most small molecule-based degraders, in particular MGDs, are low molecular weight compared to other therapeutic modalities, tissue distribution, such as into the CNS or tumor tissues, poses less of an issue 
 •Catalytic mode of action: after inducing degradation of a target protein molecule, the small molecule protein degrader-E3 ligase complex is able to induce the degradation of another target protein molecule. Thus, the small molecule protein degrader acts catalytically, unlike protein inhibition, causing the removal of many target protein molecules, thereby editing the cellular proteome 
 •Event driven pharmacology: unlike with inhibitors where prolonged engagement of the drug with the protein is required for efficacy, small molecule protein degraders only require engagement with the E3 ligase and the target protein long enough to induce tagging for degradation
As mentioned above, there are multiple advantages of the protein degradation approach, but one of the most beneficial is the potential to achieve greater therapeutic efficacy resulting from the removal of a target protein from the cellular proteome.
Current approaches to protein degradation
While lenalidomide is an MGD, the majority of recent drug discovery efforts in the design of protein degraders has been focused on PROTACs. These heterobifunctional degraders are composed of two separate small molecules connected by a chemical linker. One molecule binds to a necessary binding pocket on the target protein and the other to a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Binding of the PROTAC to both the protein of interest and the E3 ligase brings the target protein into proximity of the E3 ligase, resulting in tagging of the protein of interest for degradation. While this represents a novel way to eliminate therapeutically-relevant proteins from cells, we believe an MGD approach offers the following advantages over PROTACs:
•Ability to target undruggable proteins: MGDs utilize the richness of molecular surface features across the proteome allowing access to a broader and differentiated target space. In contrast, PROTACs require identification of a small molecule that binds to a defined binding pocket of a target of interest, which today largely constrains the approach to the universe of proteins that can already be addressed with small molecule inhibitors 
 •Favorable pharmaceutical properties: The relative simplicity and size of an MGD generally allows for more rapid optimization for oral bioavailability. PROTACs often have a larger size and larger molecular weight due to their complex heterobifunctional structure, which may lead to challenges to develop the molecules into drugs suitable for oral dosing 
 •Broader tissue distribution: The physicochemical properties of PROTACs may also limit the drug distribution within the body, thereby reducing the potential in certain therapeutics areas such as central nervous systems disorders. MGDs are more traditional small molecules and hence do not have these issues 
 •No observable hook effect: MGDs show a more typical concentration response where increasing concentrations elicit increasing efficacy caused by the catalytic interaction. In contrast, PROTACs require a precise concentration range to elicit efficacy due to the loss of degradation potential at higher concentrations caused by their heterobifunctional structure (also known as “hook effect”) 

   Figure 4: Molecule Glue Degraders; Expanding Target Space, Fostering a New Generation of Drugs
 
In summary, and as shown in Figure 4, MGDs are non-heterobifunctional and do not require an active site or binding pocket on target proteins. We believe these properties potentially expand the universe of amenable targets while also maintaining the favorable drug-like properties of small molecule therapeutics.
 Our approach
 Our approach to protein degradation involves rationally designing and developing small molecule-based MGDs to precisely edit the human proteome. Molecular glues are small molecules that induce protein-protein interactions, but not all known and characterized molecular glues lead to degradation of target proteins. Lenalidomide and pomalidomide are two approved drugs that were subsequently found to function as MGDs by causing the degradation of therapeutically-relevant proteins through the induced interaction with a component of the E3 ligase cereblon. They provide clinical validation of the MGD approach.
While the mechanism of action for these two drugs was discovered years after their introduction into the clinic, we are leveraging our platform to rationally and efficiently design our library of MGDs. Our MGDs are drug-like, non-heterobifunctional small molecules that bring together a therapeutically-relevant target protein and an E3 ligase, leading to degradation of the target protein. We believe our platform will continue to deliver MGD product candidates that have the potential to address target proteins that have been considered undruggable or inadequately drugged, while possessing attractive pharmaceutical properties. While our initial programs are utilizing cereblon as the E3 ligase system to tag target proteins the platform is built to universally leverage other E3 ligases in the future.
Our QuEEN platform was purpose-built to support our target-centric approach to the discovery and development of MGD drugs that degrade a wide landscape of therapeutically-relevant proteins by (i) systematically identifying degrons and other surface features on therapeutically-relevant target proteins that may enable degradation through our approach; and (ii) rationally designing molecules that can be optimized towards high potency and selectivity, with favorable pharmaceutical properties. Our proprietary library of rationally designed MGDs currently includes around 20,000 unique small molecules built around 400 binding scaffolds. Through our platform, we have built expertise that allows us to induce a high degree of surface complementarity between the E3 ligase and a neosubstrate, leading to high potency and selectivity for the therapeutically-relevant targets we select. Figure 5 provides an overview of our QuEEN platform.
   Figure 5: Monte Rosa’s QuEEN Discovery Platform; A Target-Centric Approach to MGD Discovery and Development
 
Our proprietary, Quantitative and Engineered Elimination of Neosubstrates platform, or QuEEN platform, encapsulates our team’s deep and growing expert knowledge and discovery capabilities across biology, chemistry and computational sciences, from which we are generating our library and pipeline of MGD product candidates. Central to our QuEEN platform is a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions promoted by our small molecule MGDs between E3 ligases and therapeutically-relevant proteins, which have been considered undruggable or inadequately drugged. We believe this depth of knowledge allows us to leverage our platform to rationally design MGDs with favorable pharmaceutical properties that have the potential to translate into clinical success across multiple therapeutic areas. Our capabilities have been developed through the three key features of our QuEEN platform, which include the following:
•Proprietary MGD library: A diverse and continuously growing chemical library of drug-like MGDs rationally designed based on our expertise in basic glue anatomy 
 •Degron Encyclopedia: A growing catalogue of degrons and associated target proteins identified through our QuEEN platform including our proprietary AI approaches that enable us to identify structural features on protein surfaces that can serve as degrons for therapeutically-relevant, but otherwise undruggable or inadequately drugged, proteins 
 •Glueomics toolbox: A tailored suite of biochemical, structural biology, cellular, proteomics and in silico screening tools that enable the discovery and optimization of MGD product candidates that efficiently recruit neosubstrates to E3 ligases
 Proprietary MGD library
We continue to rationally build our highly diverse library of MGDs by applying our computational chemistry tools and our knowledge of the cereblon-binding site and variations in degron structures. Our proprietary MGD library currently consists of over 400 unique drug scaffolds, each designed to probe different three-dimensional spaces. We use Tanimoto similarity scores, a standard way to assess compound diversity, as a design characteristic to enable the continued expansion of our diverse chemical library. Our highly diverse proprietary library currently consists of approximately 20,000 unique MGDs, as represented in Figure 6.
   Figure 6: Overview of Monte Rosa’s Proprietary Library of MGDs
 
We specifically designed our MGD library to focus on molecules with properties that resemble those of approved drugs including molecular weight; solubility, as predicted by a metric known as the partition coefficient or clogP; and polar surface area. These molecular properties impact factors such as oral bioavailability, drug exposure and metabolism, making their understanding important for drug development. Because our proprietary compounds were rationally designed to have properties that are consistent with those that result in oral compounds, they uniquely offer highly optimized starting points for drug discovery programs thereby enabling potentially rapid progress in lead optimization. Using this library, we have found multiple starting points for proteins previously not reported to be degradable by a molecular glue-based approach.
 We have shown in preclinical studies that increasing MGD diversity, while maintaining desirable pharmaceutical properties of each molecule, enabled binding to different degrons. This allows us to address more target proteins and address different protein families within the proteome.
As shown in Figure 7, our MGDs, utilizing cereblon as an E3 ligase, sit between the ligase and a neosubstrate, and function by reshaping the receptor surface, thereby attracting neosubstrates to different parts of its substrate binding site.
Figure 7: Using MGDs to Reprogram the Cereblon Surface
 
Degron encyclopedia
 For proteins to be targeted by MGDs, they need to expose a structural feature on their surface that mediates their recruitment and degradation by an E3 ligase complex. These features are called degrons and the proteins
   exposing these degrons are called neosubstrates. Neosubstrates are proteins degraded only in the presence of an MGD and are not physiological substrates of the E3 ligase. As shown in Figure 8, one such example is a protruding protein surface loop that contains a glycine amino acid, or G-loop, that mediates the interaction with a known MGD, Lenalidomide, and an E3 ligase protein called cereblon.
 Figure 8: Our Rational Approach to Unleashing the Full Potential of MGDs 

We have developed sophisticated and proprietary AI-powered algorithms to mine databases of protein structures, including structures determined from x-ray crystallography and structures from predicted protein folding, as well as to mine databases of protein sequences. We have identified topological, structural and sequence features associated with published, or canonical, as well as newly discovered, or non-canonical, degrons and encoded these features in OneVision, our suite of AI-powered algorithms that include modules leveraging deep neural networks, or DNNs, and geometric deep learning. Using both protein amino acid sequences and three-dimensional protein structures as inputs, we have deployed OneVision to identify degrons with an initial focus on identification of degrons predicting putative neosubstrates of cereblon. Using OneVision to computationally predict the presence of structural features with a high potential to function as a degron along with the presence of a surface complementary to cereblon, we have identified thousands of proteins with the potential to be neosubstrates and hence targetable by our MGDs.
A key feature of the OneVision process is the ability to integrate new discoveries from our Glueomics platform: as we characterize the activity of our expanding MGD library, OneVision learns more degron features and, projecting these features into the entire proteome, identifies more potential neosubstrates targetable by our MGDs. We have
   also started to apply OneVision to other E3 ligases. Below Figure 9 summarizes our insights into proteins that contain a canonical degron, or g-loop degron.
Figure 9: Our G-Loop Degron Encyclopedia
 
Our Degron Encyclopedia represents a rich, differentiated target space across protein domains and diseases. These potential neosubstrates represent multiple protein classes including receptors, enzymes, scaffolding proteins and other regulatory proteins, transcription factors and transcriptional repressors. Of the thousands of potential neosubstrates we have identified, over 75 % have a unique degron sequence. Because recruitment and degradation by an E3 ligase complex is mediated by both degron structure and sequence, the uniqueness of degron sequences suggests the possibility to degrade each neosubstrate with high selectivity. Over three quarters of target candidates we identified are generally considered to be undruggable due to the lack of suitable drug binding pockets. Further, these degron-containing proteins are associated with a wide landscape of diseases, suggesting that MGDs may provide benefit to patients suffering many illnesses across therapeutic areas. The ability to use an MGD to selectively degrade these target proteins could lead to the redefinition of what constitutes a druggable target and a substantial expansion of the universe of intracellular targets that are amenable to small molecule pharmaceutical intervention to treat oncology and non-oncology diseases. We prioritize target proteins based on their credentialed association with disease biology and advance the most promising targets into our drug discovery process.
Glueomics toolbox
We continue to build our experienced team of data scientists, structural biologists, biochemists, biologists and chemists. With our team’s deep expertise, we have innovated proprietary tools designed to broadly match our MGDs against degron-containing target proteins and validate these proteins as neosubstrates. Our MGD design capabilities are driven by both in silico and laboratory-based assays that predict and assess the ability of our MGDs to induce the binding of targets to E3 ligase components, such as cereblon, and directly measure target degradation. More specifically, our toolbox comprises:
•Quantitative biochemical and cellular assays: A suite of assays that have been tailored to measure specific steps of the MGD induced protein degradation cascade, including ternary complex formation and target degradation 
 •Quantitative chemo-proteomics profiling assays: A portfolio of assays that have been developed to measure protein changes within the proteome, including spatial proximity to E3 ligases and degradation of neosubstrates. These assays allow us to identify new neosubstrates, to verify cellular degradation of known and predicted novel neosubstrates, and to assess the selectivity of MGDs 
 •In silico ternary complex modeling and screening: An engine of proprietary AI-driven algorithms, called Rhapsody, to rapidly identify and prioritize MGDs that in silico are predicted to induce ternary complexes in a neosubstrate specific manner. This engine is used for new library expansion, hit discovery and expansion, and for lead identification and optimization. 

   Our proprietary in silico and laboratory-based toolbox allows us to rationally design MGDs, and to rapidly optimize their selectivity as well as chemical and biological properties, with the goal of constructing a robust pipeline of product candidates.
 Many of these tools have been built around cereblon as an E3 ligase but can be universally applied to other E3 ligases. Figure 10 is an illustrative overview of our Glueomics toolbox.
 Figure 10: Glueomics Toolbox to Accelerate MGD Discovery
 
Quantitative biochemical and cellular assays
We have developed a suite of assays that have been tailored to measure specific steps of the MGD-induced protein degradation cascade. With our first set of assays, we can measure ternary complex formation and screen for MGDs which have the most efficient binding characteristics. We have developed a Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence, or HTRF, assay to measure ternary complex formation, whereby the close proximity of cereblon and the target protein are detected by fluorescent energy transfer between antibodies binding to the two proteins. We have used these types of assays to screen multiple targets using our proprietary MGD library. Our studies have validated the ability of MGDs to drive ternary complex formation in a concentration dependent manner. By measuring the dependency of ternary complex formation on MGD concentration, we generate concentration dependent curves, enabling us to calculate objective measures of potency such as the EC50, or the concentration at which the effect is half of the maximum.
We have also developed multiple assays to measure degradation of targets in cells. The HiBiT cellular assay is one example of a high-throughput assay that we have used to screen our proprietary MGD chemical library and identify MGDs that promote cellular target degradation in a selective manner. The assay measures the decrease in luminescence signal by using an endogenous HiBiT tag fused to the target of interest. Preclinical studies using our MGDs have shown these compounds can drive target degradation in a concentration dependent manner. By measuring the dependency of target protein levels on MGD concentration, we generate concentration dependent curves, enabling us to calculate objective measures of potency such as the DC50, or the concentration at which the degradation is half of the maximum, and the Dmax, the maximum amount of target protein that is degraded.
We are using our tailored suite of biochemical and cellular assays to screen, identify and rapidly optimize our MGDs. We have demonstrated that multiple targets from our Degron Encyclopedia can be engaged and/or degraded using MGDs from our proprietary MGD library. Several examples are highlighted below in Figure 11, where we have identified MGDs that promote the association between a target protein and cereblon, including both undruggable targets and targets that have historically been inadequately drugged.
   Figure 11: Examples of MGDs that Promote Associations Between a Target Protein and Cereblon
 
Quantitative chemo-proteomics profiling assays
Utilizing our expertise in mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, we have developed a suite of high throughput quantitative profiling assays to assess multiple parameters, including cellular target degradation, selectivity of degradation and ternary complex formation in cells, the latter allowing us to identify potential neosubstrates not yet predicted by our in silico approach. We utilize this information in multiple ways, including:
•To assess target degradation and determine the selectivity of our MGDs: Proteome wide changes in expression levels of proteins after treatment with MGD are measured. Downregulation of protein levels is suggestive of degradation. 
 •To validate complex formation of our MGDs in cells: Proteins that are induced by the MGD to be proximal to the E3 ligase are tagged and enriched using a Turbo-ID proximity assay. This induced spatial proximity is suggestive of cellular ternary complex formation 
 •To identify novel neosubstrates: Screening of our MGD library with the proximity-based assay provides additional unbiased data to identify novel degrons and train our computational degron prediction algorithms to further expand the target space 
 •Additionally, we have created BaseCamp, our suite of custom software tools for data processing, archival, analysis, and visualization. Through a web interface, these software tools enable every Monte Rosa employee easy access to Glueomics screening results, Rhapsody in silico screening predictions, and the Degron Encyclopedia. Using these powerful tools, every employee is empowered as an investigator to discover connections between degraders, degrons, and diseases 
 In silico Ternary Complex Modeling and Screening (Rhapsody)
Built on our expertise in AI and data sciences, computational chemistry, structural biology and software engineering, we have developed a proprietary AI-driven engine of algorithms to rapidly identify, progress and prioritize MGDs that in silico induce ternary complexes in a neosubstrate specific manner. The engine includes modules for in silico docking, molecular fingerprinting, and SAR cliff discovery, enumeration, expansion, and generation, synthesis filtering, and structure- and ligand based virtual screening. We have named this computational tool Rhapsody.
For in silico screening, we run Rhapsody on our custom-designed cloud computing infrastructure to rapidly screen MGDs, including both those MGDs already found in our physical MGD library as well as virtual MGD libraries. Rhapsody results are used to create and identify novel MGDs that are predicted to induce neosubstrate-specific ternary complex formation, are available for rapid synthesis, and can be prioritized for follow-up experiments.
For hit expansion and MGD optimization, Rhapsody is used to generate an in silico model of the MGD-specific, MGD-induced ternary complex. Evaluation of the model allows us to rapidly predict which parts of the MGD anatomy are involved in target recruitment and which parts may be modified. This enables us to maintain or
   enhance the target-specific potency of the MGD, while optimizing its selectivity, and its other chemical and biological properties.

QuEEN expansion opportunities
Our QuEEN platform to date has been focused on identifying and developing MGDs that induce the binding of degron-containing neosubstrates to cereblon as a means of targeting them for degradation and including these MGDs in our proprietary library. We are expanding the scope of QuEEN to increase the cereblon target space and to leverage additional E3 ligases for targeted protein degradation.
•Expand the cereblon neosubstrate universe: As we rationally designed our MGD compound library to increase diversity, we found in preclinical studies that there are degrons with a diversity of amino acid sequences and 3-dimensional structures that can be targeted and we have shown we can induce efficient protein degradation through these previously undisclosed degrons. We have used our proprietary AI-driven algorithms to predict the existence of degrons from the primary sequences and the topology of proteins and are using our rational design approach to expand chemical diversity of our MGD library so to be able to target this diverse set of cereblon-accessible degrons. 
 •Utilize additional E3 ligases: We believe that we will be able to reprogram other E3 ligases through the discovery of ligase specific MGDs as well as specific ligase-accessible degrons, thus enabling us to generate ternary complexes with a further subset of the approximately 600 E3 ligases 
 Expanding the universe of neosubstrates and recruitment of neosubstrates to additional E3 ligases through the continued identification of degrons has the potential to bring more therapeutically-relevant proteins into the universe of degradable targets, which we anticipate will allow us to address additional therapeutic targets that are undruggable or insufficiently drugged.
Our precision medicine approach
MRT-2359- A Highly-Selective and Orally Bioavailable GSPT1 degrader for Myc-driven diseases
MRT-2359 is an oral MGD molecule that selectively targets GSPT1, a G-loop degron-containing neosubstrate that has been identified as a drug target in oncology. GSPT1 is a translational termination factor. We have shown that MRT-2359 reduces viability of tumor cell lines addicted to high levels of protein translation, such as those driven by the Myc oncogenes. We have shown that once daily oral dosing of MRT-2359 induced regression of Myc-driven tumors in human xenograft and patient-derived xenograft mouse models including models of NSCLC and SCLC. We anticipate filing our IND for MRT-2359 in mid-2022.
Myc regulates transcription and translation of cancer-related genes
   The Myc family of transcription factors has long been recognized as a driver of multiple human cancers and they are among the most frequently mutated, translocated and overexpressed oncogenes in human cancers. We believe that targeting the Myc pathways via downstream vulnerabilities is a viable approach to addressing Myc-driven tumors.
In humans, the Myc family of transcription factors comprises three proteins, c-Myc, L-Myc, and N-Myc, encoded by three different genes. Mutation, translocation or overexpression of any of these three proteins can lead to tumor development and progression. Extensive published studies on the role of Myc in cancer have provided insight on the mechanism by which mutations, translocations or overexpression of Myc result in uncontrolled cell growth. c-Myc is a transcription factor that is normally activated by growth factors to drive the expression of a number of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation. The aberrant activation of the gene encoding c-Myc can lead to constitutive, or always on, activation of the transcription of cell proliferation genes resulting in uncontrolled cell growth. As a consequence, there is an increasing realization that Myc-driven tumors critically rely on high translational output and the ramp up of the protein translational machinery to drive growth and proliferation.
Inhibition of Myc activity using genetic constructs has been observed to lead to strong antitumor responses in animal models of cancer. However, over forty years after the discovery of the Myc oncogene, there are no approved therapies that target the Myc family of transcription factors itself or its downstream pathways. We believe that the administration of our GSPT1-directed MGD product candidate will address a critical downstream vulnerability of oncogenic Myc activation.
Development opportunity of GSPT1 degraders to target downstream vulnerabilities of Myc activation
Aberrant activation of Myc signaling in cancer cells leads to increased transcription and, as a consequence, dependence on high rates of protein translation. This addiction creates a vulnerability to changes to the protein translation machinery in Myc-driven tumors. Using our QuEEN platform, we confirmed GSPT1, a key player of protein synthesis, as a degron-containing protein and possible neosubstrate and generated several chemical series of GSPT1 targeted MGD molecules. Leveraging our GSPT1-directed MGD molecules, we observed changes in several downstream markers for the Myc pathway in vitro, which we believe demonstrates that GSPT1 degradation is a key vulnerability for Myc-driven cancers. We observed that GSPT1 degradation was associated with downregulation of Myc proteins itself and reduced Myc signaling, including the expression of multiple Myc induced genes.
Figure 13: The Role of GSPT1 in Myc-driven, Translationally Addicted Cancer Cells and Consequences of GSPT1 Degradation
 
Potential indications
 Recent studies across 33 tumor types showed that 28% of solid cancers have an amplification of one of the Myc family genes. Amplification of c-Myc occurs most frequently in ovarian cancer (64%), esophageal cancer (45.3%), squamous lung cancer (37.2%) and breast cancer (30%). In hematological malignancies c-Myc was found to be translocated in 36% of patients with multiple myeloma, and different translocations were found at a rate between 70% and 100% in Burkitt lymphoma and to a lesser extent in other lymphomas.
N-Myc amplifications or overexpression have been reported in approximately seven to ten percent of lung adenocarcinomas, or LUAD, the main subtype of NSCLC, in addition to tumors with neuroendocrine features such
   as neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, medulloblastoma, or lung cancer and prostate cancer (neuroendocrine type, Lu-NET and NEPC, respectively). Similarly, L-Myc amplifications or overexpression have been observed in approximately 50% of SCLC. High N-Myc expression has also been reported in highly proliferative acute myeloid leukemia, or AML.
 In addition, shown in Figure 14, we analyzed the expression of both L-Myc and N-Myc in samples from patients with both NSCLC and SCLC using real world genomic data and determined the frequency to be 15% and 72% respectively. (Figures adapted from real world molecular and genomic data analysis on 3241 lung cancers (in collaboration with Tempus Labs, Inc.).)
Figure 14: Real-world Data Analysis of L-Myc and N-Myc mRNA Expression and Amplification in Lung Cancer
 
Non-small cell lung cancer
There are an estimated 228,000 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed in the United States each year. Also, lung cancer causes 143,000 deaths annually in the United States. NSCLC accounts for 80% to 85% of lung cancer cases. While targeted therapies have been developed for patients with tumors containing alterations in epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, ROS proto-oncogene 1, or ROS1, rearranged during transfection gene, or RET, anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene, or ALK, less than thirty percent of patients are eligible for these therapies. Patients who are ineligible or resistant to these therapies can be treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors that lead to significant improvements in progression free survival and overall survival compared to standard chemotherapy. However, despite the availability of these therapies, very few patients are cured of their disease and the prognosis in NSCLC remains poor, with an overall five-year survival rate for all patients diagnosed with NSCLC of 19 percent.
Our and others’ analyses of molecular data from NSCLC tumors found that around 15% of these tumors have elevated L- or N-Myc expression which our preclinical data suggests will sensitize them to GSPT1-directed MGD molecules. Furthermore, we found that there is little overlap between tumors that have high levels of L- and N-Myc and those that have genetic changes that are targeted by approved drugs. Most L- and N-Myc overexpressing lung tumors, for example, do not have alterations in genes encoding EGFR, ALK, ROS1 or RET.
Small cell lung cancer
SCLC represents approximately 15% of all lung cancers, accounting for 30,000 new cases a year in the United States. SCLC is a rapidly progressive disease with short overall survival after initial therapeutic responses. SCLC is derived from neuroendocrine cells and is distinguished clinically from NSCLC by its rapid doubling time and the early development of metastases. Most patients have metastatic disease at the time of their initial diagnoses. Unlike NSCLC, there are no targeted therapies approved for SCLC. First line therapy for these patients typically involves combination chemotherapy or radiation therapy. While patients initially respond to this chemotherapy, approximately 90% progress within one year and die within two years. The average five-year survival for newly diagnosed SCLC is 7%. Immuno-oncology agents have received approval in SCLC, but their efficacy is limited compared to that in other tumors, and some agents, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have been recently withdrawn from the market for this indication. Our analyses of molecular data from SCLC tumors found that over half of these tumors have elevated levels of L- and N-Myc expression which our preclinical data suggests will sensitize them to GSPT1-directed MGD molecules.
We believe MRT-2359 will be useful for the treatment of Myc-driven tumors.

   Preclinical studies and data
Targeting GSPT1 with our MGD molecules
We rationally designed highly selective GSPT1-directed MGD molecules to generate our product candidate MRT-2359 for the treatment of Myc-driven cancers.
Figure 15: MRT-2359 is a Potent and Selective GSPT1-Directed MGD
 
As shown in Figure 15, MRT-2359 is a potent cereblon binder, and potently induces the degradation of GSPT1 in vitro. MRT-2359 is selective against other known neosubstrates of cereblon, including the transcription factors IKZF1 & 3, SALL4, ZPF91 and the kinase CK1a. Broader selectivity profiling was undertaken using the Turbo-ID assay described previously, and this data confirmed high selectivity. The data indicates that GSPT1 and its related family member GSPT2 are the two most statistically significant proteins recruited to cereblon after treatment of cells with MRT-2359.
 Figure 16: Myc-Driven NSCLC Lines are Highly Sensitive to MRT-2359
 
   As shown in Figure 16, in a broad panel of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, MRT-2359 was demonstrated to induce preferential activity of those cell lines that had the highest expression of N-Myc or N-Myc pathway biomarkers such as p-4EBP1. The ability of MRT-2359 to preferentially reduce viability in Myc-driven cancer lines was further explored in two high N-Myc expressing cell lines (NCI-H1155 & ABC-1) and two low N-Myc expressing cell lines (NCI-H2023 and NCI-H441). The level of GSPT1 degradation in all four cell lines was comparable, however there is a clear difference in viability between the high N-Myc expressing and low N-Myc expressing cell lines, with MRT-2359 selectively targeting the Myc-driven cancer cell lines.
 Figure 17: MRT-2359 Affects N-Myc Pathway Only in Myc-Driven Cells
    As shown in Figure 17, MRT-2359 has been demonstrated to induce a down-regulation of the oncogenic driver of these cancers, N-Myc, itself. Treatment of the high N-Myc cell line NCI-H1155 with MRT2359 induced complete degradation of GSPT1 and concomitantly induced a reduction in the N-Myc protein. These cell lines were then profiled using RNAseq and a downregulation of Myc target genes was observed at 6 hours and, most notably, at 24 hours.
Conversely, in the non-Myc-driven cell line H2023, there was minimal impact on the Myc target gene set at either time point.

   Figure 18: MRT-2359 Induces Tumor Regressions in N-Myc-Driven Xenograft Models
 
As shown in Figure 18, oral administration of MRT-2359 in a mouse xenograft model of the high N-Myc NSCLC line NCI-H1155 demonstrated antitumor activity when dosed at 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg, and tumor growth regression was observed at the 10 mg/kg dose. In addition, MRT-2359 induced dose- and plasma concentration-dependent degradation of GSPT1 at 1 and 10 mg/kg, and a concomitant reduction in N-Myc protein levels in tumors was observed.
 Figure 19: MRT-2359 exhibits Anti-Tumor Activity in L-Myc and N-Myc Positive NSCLC PDX Models
 
MRT-2359 was profiled in more than 30 patient-derived xenograft mouse models. As shown in Figure 19, when dosed orally once daily at 10mg/kg, MRT-2359 induced significant regressions and lead to an overall reduction of time to progression beyond a size of >800mm in tumors with high L- or L-Myc expression. No statistically significant effect on time to progression was seen in tumors with low L- and N-Myc expression.
Clinical development plans for GSPT1-directed MGD MRT-2359
   We intend to submit our IND for MRT-2359 in mid-2022 and initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial shortly thereafter. Our early phase clinical development is designed as a dose escalation trial to identify the recommended dose for expansion. The primary endpoint of this trial will be to determine the safety and tolerability of MRT-2359 when dosed orally and the secondary endpoints will be to characterize the PK/PD and anti-tumor activity in the biomarker positive patients.

CDK2-directed MGD molecules for the treatment of ovarian and breast cancer
Cyclin dependent kinases, or CDKs, are a family of closely related kinases that regulate progression through the cell cycle. CDK activity is further modulated by levels of specific cyclins. For example, cyclin E1 activates cyclin-dependent kinase 2, or CDK2. CDK2 is activated in tumors by (i) amplification or overexpression of Cyclin E1 or E2, (ii) loss-of-function alterations of the AMBRA1 gene, or (iii) loss-of-function alterations of the retinoblastoma (RB1) gene. Cyclin E1 dysregulation has been found in a number of cancers, including ovarian and triple negative breast cancer. In addition, cyclin E1 dysregulation and CDK2 activation has also been found to be one of the mechanisms of resistance in estrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients treated with CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors, such as palbociclib. Therefore, we believe selective elimination of CDK2 may provide benefit to these patients. Previously reported small molecule inhibitors and PROTACs of CDK2 have been limited in their selectivity due to the high degree of similarity among the active sites of CDKs. We have identified multiple MGD molecules that selectively promoted the association of CDK2 and cereblon in vitro, while avoiding other CDKs, and are in the process of optimizing the chemical leads.
   Figure 21: CDK2 is One of the Key Regulators of the Cell Cycle
 
Identification of CDK2 degron and MGD molecules
Our Degron Encyclopedia indicates that CDK2 contains a degron which has unique amino acid sequence compared to other members of the CDK family and within the protein kinase family in general. This contrasts with the higher sequence similarity of the active site (ATP-binding pocket) shared between, for example, CDK protein family members CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 which has historically been used to develop small molecule kinase inhibitors.
We screened a CDK2/cyclin E1 complex in a biochemical HTRF assay with our proprietary MGD library and identified several MGDs that promoted the association of the CDK2/cyclin E1 complex with cereblon. We then confirmed that these MGD molecules showed concentration-dependent ternary complex formation. We also assessed the biochemical selectivity of the hits over CDK1, CDK4 and CDK9 using similar HTRF assays. No ternary complex formation with these closely related kinases was observed (data not shown). Based on these initial hits, we have initiated lead optimization chemistry and have successfully delivered several lead compounds from different chemical series.
Preclinical studies and data
In support of future preclinical development activities, we have observed high selectivity potential in in vitro studies for our CDK2-directed MGD molecules.
In vitro data
Our lead optimization process has provided several MGDs that promote ternary complex formation in cells as demonstrated using our proximity-based Turbo-ID proteomics assay. In the experiment shown in the left panel of Figure 22, HEK293 cells were treated for 6 hours with one of our MGD lead molecules. As shown in the volcano plot, proximity of CDK2 protein to cereblon was significantly increased after treatment of cells with the CDK2-directed MGD, indicating formation of ternary complexes. Proteomic analysis of HEK293 cells treated for 24 hours with the same MGD indicated preferential degradation of CDK2, shown in the right panel in Figure 22. Neither induced cereblon proximity nor degradation were observed for other CDK family members, further highlighting the selectivity of our MGD.
   Figure 22: Rationally Designed CDK2-Directed MGDs are Selective
    
NEK7 degraders for inflammatory disease
The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that serves as a central node to integrate cellular signals generated by pathogens, damage and stress, and subsequently triggers the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been implicated in a number of autoinflammatory disorders including Crohn’s disease, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and liver disease. Additionally, multiple activating NLRP3 mutations have been shown to be associated with Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes. NIMA-Related Kinase 7, or NEK7, a serine/threonine-protein kinase, activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in a kinase independent manner, suggesting that degradation of NEK7 with an MGD molecule is an attractive therapeutic approach. We found that NEK7 contains a well-defined degron and have identified MGD molecules that are highly selective for NEK7 in in vitro models. We are currently optimizing chemical leads that are derived from multiple series of MGD molecules in this program.
NEK7 binding to NLRP3 is an essential step in promoting the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The assembly of NLRP3/NEK7 with ASC and pro-caspase 1 in a multi-protein complex induces cleavage of pro-caspase 1, which then activates multiple inflammatory responses including secretion of the cytokines interleukin-1ß and interleukin-18 and induction of pyroptosis. Knockout of NEK7 in animal models has been shown to decrease inflammatory signaling, which leads to decreased disease severity in models of inflammatory diseases. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is driven through a kinase-independent function of NEK7, suggesting that inhibition of the catalytic activity of NEK7 would be ineffective in blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
   Figure 23: NEK7 is an Essential Regulator of the Inflammasome
 
 Figure 24: Overactivation of the NLRP3 Inflammasome in Diseases
 
Identification of NEK7 degron and MGD molecules
NEK7 contains a well-defined degron, as identified using our proprietary QuEEN platform (shown in Figure 25). The amino acid sequence of the NEK7 degron is unique among the NEK family members, indicating the potential to identify MGD molecules that are highly selective for NEK7. Given the kinase independent role of NEK7 in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome, we believe that degradation of NEK7 with our MGDs will be preferable over conventional catalytic inhibition strategies. We screened NEK7 in a biochemical HTRF proximity assay with our proprietary MGD molecule library and identified multiple MGD molecules that promoted association of NEK7 and cereblon (not shown). These MGD molecules showed concentration dependent ternary complex formation as exemplified in Figure 25 (left panel). Based on these initial hits, we have initiated lead optimization chemistry and have successfully delivered several lead compounds from different chemical series.
   Figure 25: Rationally Designed NEK7-Directed MGDs are Selective
 
Preclinical studies and data
In support of future preclinical development activities, we have observed high selectivity potential in in vitro [MW1] studies for our NEK7 MGD molecules using both our multiple HTRF and NanoBiT assays as well as our chemoproteomic approaches such as Turbo-ID.
 In vitro data
Our lead optimization process has provided several MGDs that promote ternary complex formation in cells as demonstrated using our proximity-based Turbo-ID proteomics assay. In the experiment, U937 human leukemia cells were treated for six hours with one of our MGD lead molecules. As shown in the volcano plot (Figure 25, middle panel), proximity of NEK7 protein to cereblon was significantly increased after treatment of cells with the NEK7-directed MGD, indicating formation of ternary complexes in cells. Proteomic analysis of U937 cells treated for 24 hours with the same MGD indicated preferential degradation of NEK7 (Figure 25, right panel).
 Our MGD molecules show high potency for modulation of NLRP3 pathway in human Monocyte Derived Macrophages
We treated human Monocyte Derived Macrophages, or hMDMs, from multiple donors with increasing concentrations of one of our MGD molecules. As shown in the left panel of Figure 26, treatment with this MGD molecule led to a dose-dependent degradation of NEK7 in hMDMs, with a DC50of 3.2 nM. We also measured IL-1β secretion from hMDMs following 20 hour treatment with our MGD molecule and subsequent exposure to inflammasome stimulators LPS+Nigericin. As shown in the middle panel of Figure 26, our NEK7-directed MGD molecule led to a dose-dependent decrease in IL-1β secretion. We also compared the efficacy of our MGD molecule to the clinical stage NLRP3 inhibitor Inzomelid and as shown in the right panel of Figure 26, our MGD molecule shows superior modulation of NLRP3 pathway-induced IL-1β and IL-18 secretion.

   Figure 26: NEK7-Directed MGDs Modulate NLRP3 Pathway in Human Macrophages
 
VAV1-directed MGD molecules for hematological cancers and autoimmune disease
VAV1, a Rho-family guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is expressed in immune cells including T and B cells and functions to mediate T and B cell receptor signaling (shown in Figure 27). Because of VAV1’s function in both T and B cells, degradation could provide therapeutic benefits in multiple autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, and in settings of transplantation and graft-versus-host disease. VAV1 has also been implicated in hematological malignancies, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or T-ALL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL. While considered an undruggable protein, we identified VAV1 as a degron-containing protein and have discovered MGD molecules that promoted association of VAV1 and cereblon and lead to degradation of VAV1 protein. We plan to optimize chemical leads that are derived from multiple series of MGD molecules.
Figure 27: VAV1 Functions to Mediate T and B Cell Receptor Signaling
 
Identification of VAV1 degron and MGD molecules
Our Degron Encyclopedia indicates that VAV1 contains a degron that is unique compared to other members of the VAV family, suggesting we can target VAV1 selectively with our MGD molecules.
   As shown in Figure 28, we screened VAV1 in a biochemical HTRF assay with our proprietary MGD molecule library and identified multiple MGD molecules that promoted the association of VAV1 and cereblon. We then observed that these MGD molecules showed concentration-dependent ternary complex formation, shown in Figure 28, left-hand panel. These MGD molecules were also highly selective over several known and novel neosubstrates, including GSPT1.
Figure 28: Rationally Designed MGDs Selectively Degrade VAV1
 
VAV1-directed MGDs lead to selective VAV1 degradation
 To assess the potency of cellular degradation in cells, we tested a MGD in an engineered VAV1-NanoBiT system. As shown above in the middle panel, this MGD molecule led to a dose-dependent degradation of VAV1 in Jurkat cells, with a DC50of 24.9 nM. To further test degradation and selectivity, we also performed spectrometry-based proteomics in wildtype Jurkat cells, treated with 10 μM MGD for 24 hours. Shown in the volcano plot in Figure 28, right panel, VAV1 was selectively and significantly down-modulated, relative to DMSO control.
BCL11A-directed MGD molecules for the treatment of sickle cell disease and ß-Thalassemia
Sickle cell disease, or SCD, is caused by a mutation in a form of hemoglobin, leading to severe disease manifestations, including anemia and vaso-occlusive crises. However, in SCD patients, increasing levels of fetal hemoglobin, or HbF, are associated with fewer co-morbidities and a better prognosis. In adults, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A, or BCL11A, represses transcription of the HBG gene, thereby silencing HbF expression. We believe that downregulation of BCL11A to reactivate HbF expression is a promising therapeutic strategy, and it is being clinically tested by third parties to treat SCD using adoptive cell therapy. BCL11A has to date been considered undruggable using small molecule therapies. We believe reactivation of HbF through MGD-mediated BCL11A degradation could be used as a therapeutic strategy for both SCD as well as other hemoglobinopathies, such as ß-Thalassemia. We identified BCL11A as a degron-containing protein and, in preclinical studies, we observed that our MGD molecules induced the association of BCL11A with cereblon. We plan to optimize chemical leads that are derived from multiple series of MGD molecules.
   Figure 29: BCL11A is the Zinc Finger Transcription Repressor of the Fetal Globin Genes
 
Current status and next steps of our discovery programs
We are currently optimizing chemical leads that are derived from multiple series of MGD molecules in the CDK2, NEK7, VAV1 and BCL11A programs. The CDK2 and NEK7 programs are in lead optimization with the next anticipated milestone being selection of a development candidate and the initiation of IND-enabling studies.
 Other programs
We are specifically focused on developing product candidates for targets that have been deemed undruggable or inadequately drugged. Our QuEEN platform was purpose-built to support the discovery and development of drugs that degrade a wide landscape of therapeutically-relevant proteins by (i) systematically identifying therapeutically-relevant target proteins that may be amenable to molecular glue-based degradation; and (ii) rationally designing molecules that can be optimized towards high potency and selectivity, with properties that we believe to be favorable. Our early pipeline includes programs in genetically defined oncology indications, as well as inflammatory, immunologic and genetic disease indications. We are further engaged in the discovery of additional targets in other indications, including, but not limited to, neurodegenerative and other neurological diseases. We are planning to develop our MGD molecules in succinct patient populations through biomarker-driven clinical trials.

The biotechnology industry is extremely competitive in the race to develop new products and the industry is characterized by a high level of innovation and strong emphasis on proprietary products and intellectual property rights. While we believe we have significant competitive advantages due to our management team’s years of expertise in protein degradation, molecular glues and clinical and preclinical development of precision medicines in general, coupled with our unique scientific expertise and our growing portfolio of intellectual property rights, we currently face and will continue to face competition for our development programs from other companies that develop heterobifunctional degraders, similar molecular glue degraders or have protein degradation development platforms and their own associated intellectual property. Our competition will also include companies focused on existing and novel therapeutic modalities such as small molecule inhibitors antibodies and gene therapies. The competition is likely to come from multiple sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and academic institutions that are in the business of research, development,
   manufacturing and commercialization. Moreover, the existence of large numbers of patents and frequent allegations of patent infringement is typical in our industry.
Competitors in our efforts to develop MGD therapeutics for patients, include, but are not limited to, BioTheryX Therapeutics, Inc., C4 Therapeutics, Inc., Nurix Therapeutics, Inc., Kymera Therapeutics, Inc., Seed Therapeutics, Inc., Plexium Inc, Bristol-Myers Squib, and Novartis, all of whom have reported having MGD product candidates in preclinical or clinical development. In addition, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, which are both marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, are believed to function as MGDs. Further, several large pharmaceutical companies have disclosed investments in this field.
 In addition to the competitors we face in developing small molecule protein degraders, we will also face competition in the indications we expect to pursue with our MGD programs. Many of these indications already have approved standards of care which may include existing therapeutic modalities. In order to compete effectively with these existing therapies, we will need to demonstrate that our MGDs perform favorably when compared to existing therapeutics.
 Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates and we currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We currently contract with third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture of our product candidates and we intend to continue to do so in the future. We rely on and expect to continue to engage on third-party manufacturers for the production of both drug substance and finished drug product. We currently obtain our supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. Should any of these manufacturers become unavailable to us or their services to us become delayed for any reason, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements, although we may incur some delay in identifying and qualifying such replacements.
Intellectual property
We are an innovation-driven company and we seek to aggressively protect the innovations, intellectual property, and proprietary technology that we generate that we consider important to our business, including by pursuing patent applications that cover our product candidates and methods of using the same, innovations around our QuEEN platform and our proprietary library of MGDs, as well as any other relevant innovations, inventions, and improvements that are considered potentially commercially relevant to the development of our business and to maintain our perceived competitive advantages. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. For our product candidates, we generally intend to pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, including combination therapies, methods of administration including dosing methods, methods for monitoring potential clinical events, compositions and methods for personalizing, monitoring, and potentially refining clinical use, including biomarkers, processes of manufacture and process intermediates, where relevant. For our QuEEN platform, we generally intend to pursue patent protection covering our approaches, methods, and research and development tools relevant to our degron encyclopedia, our Rhapsody, tools, and our library of MGDs. We continually assess and iteratively refine our intellectual property strategies as we develop new innovations and product candidates. We currently plan to continue to invest in filing additional patent applications based on our intellectual property strategies to continue to build value in our business and/or to improve our business and potential partnering opportunities, where appropriate.
 Our commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business, and to defend any patents we may own or in-license in the future, prevent others from infringing any patents we may own or in-license in the future, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending provisional and Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents and the validity and/or enforceability of any of our issued patents may be challenged by third parties. Further, as with other companies, the patents may obtain
   do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Regarding obtaining issued patents, here in the United States as well as in other jurisdictions of interest to our business, the patent positions for biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. Further, the laws governing the protection of intellectual property may change over time due to the issuance of new judicial decisions or the passage of new laws, rules or regulations. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued and its scope can be reinterpreted and challenged even after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our product candidates will be protected or remain protectable by valid, enforceable patents. We also cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
The exclusivity terms of our patents depend upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In the countries in which we currently intend to file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. The term of a U.S. patent may be extended to compensate for the time required to obtain regulatory approval to sell a drug (referred to as a patent term extension) or by delays encountered during patent prosecution that are caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (referred to as patent term adjustment). For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved new chemical entity drugs of up to five years beyond the ordinary expiration date of one patent that covers the approved drug or its use. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review and diligence during the review process. Patent term extensions in the United States cannot extend the term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent covering an approved drug or its method of use may be extended. A similar kind of patent extension, referred to as a Supplementary Protection Certificate, is available in Europe. Legal frameworks may also be available in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent. We currently intend to seek patent term extensions for our products on any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where we have a qualifying patent and the extension is available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable regulatory authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether extensions of this nature should be granted and, even if granted, the length of these extensions. Further, even if any of our patents are extended or adjusted, those patents, including the extended or adjusted portion of those patents, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of final jurisdiction in the United States or a foreign country.
 Patents and Patent Applications
 As of December 31, 2021, we solely owned one pending patent application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and multiple pending foreign patent applications and United States provisional patent applications, as further described below. Patent prosecution related to our pending patent applications is currently in the early stages and, as such, no patent examiner has yet fully scrutinized the merits of any of our pending patent applications.
Wholly Owned Product Candidates
 With respect to our GSPT1 program, as of December 31, 2021, we owned six pending Swiss priority patent applications, four pending United States provisional applications, and one pending PCT patent application (WO2021069705) that has not entered national stage that cover various GSPT1 degraders and uses thereof. These patent applications are drawn compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of using our GSPT1 degraders. The earliest scheduled expiration of any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from the PCT patent application drawn to GSPT1 degraders, if such patent is issued, would be 2040, excluding any additional term for available patent term adjustment or patent term extension, and assuming national phase entries are timely made based upon the pending PCT application and timely payment of all applicable maintenance or annuity fees. We also owned six Swiss priority patent applications that cover biomarkers related to use of our GSPT1 degraders. We also owned four U.S. provisional patent applications relating to our CDK1 program, and one U.S. provisional patent application relating to our NEK7 program. The earliest scheduled expiration of any U.S. or foreign patents issuing from these U.S. provisional patent applications, if such patents are issued, would be 2042, excluding any additional term for available patent term adjustment or patent term extension.
QuEEN platform
 With respect to our QuEEN platform, as of December 31, 2021, we owned four U.S. provisional patent applications drawn to our QuEEN platform and the use thereof in developing and applying therapeutics. QuEEN platform. The earliest scheduled expiration of any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from these U.S. provisional patent
   applications, if such patents are issued, would be 2042, excluding any available additional term for patent term adjustment or patent term extension.
Trademarks
 As of December 31, 2021, we owned various registered and unregistered trademarks in the United States, including Monte Rosa Therapeutics, our housemark logo, the name of our QuEEN platform, and the name of our Glueomics resource.
Trade Secrets and Know How
 As an innovation driven biotechnology company, we rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain the competitive advantage relevant to our business. Under the agreements we enter into with our employees and consultants, full rights in any intellectual property are assigned to us. We also rely on confidentiality or other agreements with our employees, consultants, other advisors and business partners to protect our proprietary information. Our policy is to require third parties that receive material confidential information to enter into confidentiality or other agreements with us that contain appropriate protections for our confidential and trade secret information.
 Government regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local level, as well as in foreign countries and local jurisdictions, extensively regulate among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, sampling, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs. We, along with our vendors, contract research organizations and contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, as amended, its implementing regulations and other laws. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing, approval or any other legal requirements relating to product manufacture, processing, handling, storage, quality control, safety, marketing, advertising, promotion, packaging, labeling, export, import, distribution, or sale, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, withdrawal of approvals, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an IRB or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCP requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
 •submission to the FDA of a NDA; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA, to accept the filing for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; 

   •payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S. 
 Preclinical studies and clinical trials for drugs
Before testing any drug in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety/toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research patients will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable related to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. Information about applicable clinical trials, including clinical trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, excretion the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 

   •Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. 
 •Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. marketing approval for drugs
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy in order to be approved. The marketing application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the U.S.
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including
   a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS program could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk-minimization tools.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects 200,000 or more individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent but for a different indication than that for
   which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Expedited development and review programs for drugs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs to get them to patients earlier than under standard FDA development and review procedures.
A new drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, as well as Priority Review, discussed below.
In addition, a new drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process including Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under priority review, the FDA targets reviewing an application in six months after filing compared to ten months after filing for a standard review.
Additionally, products are eligible for Accelerated Approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Accelerated Approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under Accelerated Approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for Accelerated Approval, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period, and that after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process.
Pediatric information and pediatric exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, certain NDAs and certain supplements to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant
   pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FD&C Act requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 trial. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
A drug can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial or of multiple pediatric trials in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such trials.
U.S. post-approval requirements for drugs
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers and individuals working on behalf of manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; 
 •fines, warning letters or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and 

   •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information. 
 Marketing exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions under the FD&C Act can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FD&C Act provides a five-year period of non-patent exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
The FD&C Act alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Other regulatory matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the U.S. in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
Current and future healthcare reform legislation
In the United States and in some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes intended to broaden access to healthcare, improve the quality of healthcare, and contain or lower the cost of healthcare. For example, in the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or ACA, among other things, subjected products to potential competition by lower-cost products, expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and created a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or BBA, effective as of January 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
There have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA Act as well as efforts to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work
   requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
Other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted. By way of example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year. This reduction went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Then, a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022. CMS has indicated that it is delaying the processing of claims in April to allow Congress to pass legislation that would extend the suspension. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Furthermore, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the previous administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. On July 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing the FDA to, among other things, continue to clarify and improve the approval framework for generic drugs and identify and address any efforts to impede generic drug competition.
 Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. It is difficult to predict the future legislative landscape in healthcare and the effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. However, we expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Third-party payor coverage and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory marketing approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid), managed care providers, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and other organizations. These third-party payors decide which medications they will pay for and will establish reimbursement levels. The availability of coverage and extent of reimbursement by governmental and other third-party payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford treatments such as targeted protein degradation therapies.
In the United States, no uniform policy exists for coverage and reimbursement for products among third-party payors. Therefore, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan; 
 •safe, effective and medically necessary; 
 •appropriate for the specific patient; 
 •cost-effective; and 
 •neither experimental nor investigational. 

   One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service . Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which may not include all FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded product on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. Our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors.
Moreover, the process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate a payor will pay for the product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, we may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Despite our best efforts, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover an approved product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition.
Finally, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing product pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, in the European Union, or EU, pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products are regulated at a national level under the individual EU Member States’ social security systems. Some foreign countries provide options to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and can control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. A country may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Even if approved for reimbursement, historically, product candidates launched in some foreign countries, such as some countries in the EU, do not follow price structures of the U.S. and prices generally tend to be significantly lower.
Other healthcare laws and regulations
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws, as well as other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and distribution strategies. In the U.S., these laws include, among others:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts and credits), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, or arranging for, an item, good, facility or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The AKS has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations can result in significant civil monetary and criminal penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the amount of remuneration, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. 

   •Additionally, the civil False Claims Act, or FCA, prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in very significant monetary penalties, for each false claim and treble the amount of the government’s damages. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. Further, a violation of the AKS can also form the basis for FCA liability. 
 •The U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes additional criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private); and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes, among other things, certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, transmit, or obtain, protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 •Federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which requires manufacturers of certain drugs, devices, medical supplies, and biologics, among others, to track and disclose payments under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. This information is subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website. 
 •Federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs.
 •Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
 •Analogous state law equivalents of each of the above U.S. federal laws and similar healthcare laws and regulations in the European Union and other jurisdictions, such, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers or patients; state and local marketing and/or transparency laws applicable to manufacturers that may be broader in scope than the federal requirements; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; state and local laws that require the licensure and/or registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information and/or other health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

   The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal, state and foreign enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties, and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
Failure to comply with privacy and data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity, and could negatively affect our operating results and business.
 We may be subject to Swiss, European, US federal, state, and foreign data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the European Union, we may be subject to additional privacy restrictions. The collection and use of personal data including health information in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR as well as national data protection laws.. The GDPR imposes a broad range of strict requirements on companies subject to the GDPR, such as including requirements relating to having legal bases for processing personal data relating to identifiable individuals and transferring such information outside the European Economic Area, or EEA, including to the U.S. (see below), providing details to those individuals regarding the processing of their personal data, implementing safeguards to keep personal data secure, having data processing agreements with third parties who process personal data, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, responding to individuals’ requests to exercise their rights in respect of their personal data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, reporting security and privacy breaches involving personal data to the competent national data protection authority and affected individuals, appointing data protection officers, conducting data protection impact assessments, and record-keeping. The GDPR substantially increases the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance, including fines of up to €20,000,000 or 4% of total annual global revenue, whichever is greater. The GDPR increases the responsibility and liability of pharmaceutical companies in relation to processing personal data, and companies may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules. The GDPR introduced new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
In addition, the United Kingdom (UK) incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law (referred to as the 'UK GDPR'), following its exit from the EU in 2020. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR, the European Commission (“EC”) has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing.
 In Switzerland, we are also subject to comprehensive data protection requirements including the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (DPA) which imposes stringent rules on the processing of personal data including health related information.

   In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including federal health information privacy laws, state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our collaborators. In California, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) was enacted in June 2018, became effective on January 1, 2020, and became subject to enforcement by the California Attorney General's office on July 1, 2020. The CCPA broadly defines personal information, and creates new individual privacy rights and protections for California consumers. places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households, and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. While there is an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, the CCPA may impact our business activities if we become a "Business" regulated by the scope of the CCPA.
 Further, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was passed by California voters on November 3, 2020. The CPRA will create additional obligations relating to personal information that are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023 (with certain provisions having retroactive effect to January 1, 2022). While the legislation and proposed regulations include the CCPA and CPRA contain an exception for activities that are subject to HIPAA, we cannot yet determine the impact the CCPA, CPRA or other such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. A number of other states have proposed new privacy laws, some of which are similar to the above discussed recently passed laws. Such proposed legislation, if enacted, may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies. The existence of comprehensive privacy laws in different states in the country would make our compliance obligations more complex and costly and may increase the likelihood that we may be subject to enforcement actions or otherwise incur liability for noncompliance
 The uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the CCPA, recent and emerging state privacy and other similar laws, regulations and standards that may be adopted in other jurisdictions exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. Compliance with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil, criminal and administrative penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, clinical trial subjects, employees and other individuals about whom we or our potential collaborators obtain personal information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may limit our ability to collect, use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.
 Many jurisdictions outside of Europe where we do business directly or through master resellers today and may seek to expand our business in the future, are also considering and/or have enacted comprehensive data protection legislation. We also continue to see jurisdictions imposing data localization laws. These and similar regulations may interfere with our intended business activities, inhibit our ability to expand into those markets, require modifications to our products or services or prohibit us from continuing to offer services in those markets without significant additional costs.
 Compliance with other federal and state laws or requirements; changing legal requirements
If any products that we may develop are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, among other requirements to we may be subject.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
   The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, relabeling or repackaging, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any claim or action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on marketing, sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling or packaging; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Other U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
Government regulation of drugs outside of the United States
To market any product outside of the U.S., we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization or identification of an alternate regulatory pathway, manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Non-clinical studies and clinical trials
Similarly to the U.S., the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union, or EU, are subject to significant regulatory controls.
Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the safety and non-toxicity of new chemical (or biological) substances. Non-clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice, or GLP, as set forth in the Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the EU for example,
   a clinical trial authorization, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved by the national health authority and the ethics committee has granted a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the trial in the relevant member state(s), in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical study development may proceed.
Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU member states govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under this system, and prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a CTA from the competent national authority of each EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific trial site after the relevant independent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The CTA must be accompanied by, among other documents, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation and other supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the CTA must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with GMP. Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the Clinical Trials Regulation, was adopted. It is expected that the Clinical Trials Regulation will apply following confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS, the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the regulation, through an independent audit. The regulation becomes applicable six months after the European Commission publishes notice of this confirmation. The Clinical Trials Regulation is currently expected to become applicable by early 2022. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all EU member states, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the EU will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable, the Clinical Trials Regulation will apply to the clinical trial from the expiry of such three year period. The Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU, for example by providing for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and simplifying reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors.
Marketing authorizations
In the EU, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug in the EU, a marketing authorization application, or MAA must be submitted. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. Medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either the centralized authorization procedure or a national authorization procedures.
•Centralized procedure—If pursuing a MA for a product candidate for a therapeutic indication under the centralized procedure, following the opinion of the European Medicines Agency’s, or EMA, Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or, CHMP, the European Commission issues a single MA valid across the EU as well as in the European Economic Area, or EEA, countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, or advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized MA to the 

   EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who makes the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of a MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for certain expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment, however this is not guaranteed. The benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a CHMP rapporteur before submission of a MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process.
•National authorization procedures—There are also two other possible routes to authorize products for therapeutic indications in several EU member states, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 
 •Decentralized procedure—Under the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU member state for medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU member states. 
 •Mutual recognition procedure—Under the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU member state, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, the applicant may seek additional MAs from other EU member states in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national MA. 
 MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance.
Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized MAs (under the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized MAs will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new MA in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. A separate application will, however, still be required.
Data and marketing exclusivity
In the EU, upon receiving a MA, innovative medicinal products, sometimes referred to as new chemical entities (i.e., reference products) generally qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, the data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the non-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic/biosimilar MAA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed in the EU until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU or member state regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
   Orphan medicinal products
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the U.S. In the EU a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (i) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (ii) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (iii) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for MA. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a MA, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, no MAA shall be accepted by the EMA for the same indication in respect of a similar medicinal product for the same indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, MA may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
Pediatric development
In the EU, MAAs for new medicinal products must include the results of trials conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO, unless a waiver or deferral applies. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which a MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data are not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the MA is obtained in all EU member states and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for a six-months supplementary protection certificate extension (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan pharmaceutical products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity is granted.
Post-approval requirements
Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the member states. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs. All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another.
   Failure to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, authorization of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Should we utilize third-party distributors, compliance with such foreign governmental regulations would generally be the responsibility of such distributors, who may be independent contractors over whom we have limited control.
Brexit and the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom
In June 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit”. Thereafter, in March 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The United Kingdom formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which European Union pharmaceutical law remains applicable to the United Kingdom. This transition period is due to end on December 31, 2020. This means that since January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom operates under a distinct regulatory regime. EU pharmaceutical laws now only apply to the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland (as laid out in the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including but not limited to MAAs). Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, MA, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom.
Employees and human capital resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 93 full-time employees, of which 47 have M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Within our workforce, 72 employees are engaged in research and development and 21 are engaged in business development, finance, legal, and general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of equity-based compensation awards in order to increase shareholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters is located in Boston, Massachusetts, where we currently lease and occupy approximately 16,748 square feet of office space at 645 Summer Street, Boston, MA 02210. The current term of our Boston lease expires in March 2026. In December 2021, we executed a lease with B9 LS Harrison & Washington LLC, or the Landlord, for approximately 63,327 square feet of office and laboratory space at 321 Harrison Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts, or the Premises, which is expected to serve as our new headquarters beginning in April 1, 2022, and our obligation to pay rent will begin upon the earlier of (a) eight (8) months following April 1, 2022 and (b) the date which is two (2) months following the date which we complete our tenant improvements. The initial term of the lease is one hundred twenty-eight (128) months following April 1, 2022. The annual base rent under the lease is $95.00 per square foot for the first year, which is subject to scheduled annual increases of 3%, plus certain costs, operating expenses and property management fees. We have the option to
   extend the lease once for (5) five-years upon notice to the Landlord at least one (1) year prior to the end of the then-current term. We also have the option to sublet the Premises on the terms and conditions set forth in the lease. We have an additional location used for office and lab space that occupies approximately 21,422 square feet located at Klybeckstrasse 191, WKL-136.3, 4057 Basel, Basel-City, Switzerland.
We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and for the foreseeable future. To meet the future needs of our business, we may lease additional or alternate space. We believe that suitable additional or substitute space at commercially reasonable terms will be available as needed to accommodate any future expansion of our operations.
Legal proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any litigation or legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are probable to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
