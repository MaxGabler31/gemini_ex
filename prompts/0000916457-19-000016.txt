BUSINESS AND STRATEGY
Business
We are a premier competitive power company with 79 power plants primarily in the U.S. We sell power and related services to our wholesale customers who include commercial and industrial end-users, state and regional wholesale market operators, and our retail customers. We measure our success by delivering long-term value. We accomplish this through our focus on operational excellence at our power plants and in our customer and commercial activity, as well as through our disciplined approach to capital allocation. 
On August 17, 2017, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Volt Parent, LP (“Volt Parent”) and Volt Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Volt Parent, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Calpine, with Calpine surviving the Merger as a subsidiary of Volt Parent. On March 8, 2018, we completed the Merger contemplated in the Merger Agreement.
At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Calpine common stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (excluding certain shares as described in the Merger Agreement) ceased to be outstanding and was converted into the right to receive $15.25 per share in cash or approximately $5.6 billion in total. 
We are one of the largest power generators in the U.S. measured by power produced. We own and operate primarily natural gas-fired and geothermal power plants in North America and have a significant presence in major competitive wholesale and retail power markets in California, Texas and the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. Since our inception in 1984, we have been a leader in environmental stewardship. We have invested in clean power generation to become a recognized leader in developing, constructing, owning and operating an environmentally responsible portfolio of flexible and reliable power plants. Our portfolio is primarily comprised of two types of power generation technologies: efficient combined-cycle power plants, which use natural gas-fired combustion turbines, and renewable geothermal conventional steam turbines. We are among the world’s largest owners and operators of industrial gas turbines as well as cogeneration power plants. Our Geysers Assets located in northern California represent the largest geothermal power generation portfolio in the U.S. as well as the largest single producing power generation asset of all renewable energy in the state of California. 
We sell power, steam, capacity, renewable energy credits and ancillary services to our customers, which include utilities, independent electric system operators, industrial and agricultural companies, retail power providers, municipalities and other governmental entities, power marketers as well as retail commercial, industrial, governmental and residential customers. We continue to focus on providing products and services that are beneficial to our wholesale and retail customers. We purchase primarily natural gas and some fuel oil as fuel for our power plants and engage in related natural gas transportation and storage transactions. We also purchase power for sale to our customers and purchase electric transmission rights to deliver power to our customers. Additionally, consistent with our Risk Management Policy, we enter into natural gas, power, environmental product, fuel oil and other physical and financial commodity contracts to hedge certain business risks and optimize our portfolio of power plants. Seasonality and weather can have a significant effect on our results of operations and are also considered in our hedging and optimization activities.
We assess our wholesale business on a regional basis due to the effect on our financial performance of the differing characteristics of these regions, particularly with respect to competition, regulation and other factors affecting supply and demand. During the first quarter of 2018, we altered the composition of our segments to report the results associated with our retail business as a separate segment. This change reflects the manner in which our segment information is presented internally to our chief operating decision maker associated with the strategic utilization of our retail business subsequent to the consummation of the Merger. Thus, beginning in the first quarter of 2018, our geographic reportable segments for our wholesale business are West (including geothermal), Texas and East (including Canada) and we have a separate reportable segment for our retail business. 
Our wholesale power plant portfolio, including partnership interests, consists of 79 power plants with an aggregate current generation capacity of 26,678 MW. Inclusive of our power generation portfolio and our retail sales platforms, we serve customers in 24 states in the U.S. and in Canada and Mexico. Our fleet consists of 64 natural gas-fired combustion turbine-based plants, one natural gas and fuel oil-fired steam-based plant, 13 geothermal steam turbine-based plants and one photovoltaic solar plant.

Our goal is to be recognized as the premier competitive power company in the U.S. as viewed by our employees, owners, customers and policy-makers as well as the communities in which our facilities are located. We seek to deliver long-term value through operational excellence at our power plants and in our customer and commercial activity, as well as through our disciplined approach to capital allocation. 
THE MARKET FOR POWER
Our Power Markets and Market Fundamentals
The power industry represents one of the largest industries in the U.S. and affects nearly every aspect of our economy, with an estimated end-user market of approximately $402 billion in power sales in 2018 according to the EIA. Although different regions of the country have very different models and rules for competition, the markets in which we operate have some form of wholesale or retail market competition. California (included in our West segment), Texas (included in our Texas segment) and the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions (included in our East segment), which are the markets in which we have our largest presence, have emerged as among the most competitive wholesale and retail power markets in the U.S. We also operate, to a lesser extent, in competitive wholesale power markets in the Southeast and the Midwest. In addition to our sales of electrical power to wholesale and retail customers, our power plants produce several other products. A description of the products we provide to our customers is below:

• | First, we are a provider of power to utilities, independent electric system operators, industrial and agricultural companies, retail power providers, municipalities and other governmental entities, power marketers as well as retail commercial, industrial, governmental and residential customers. Our power sales occur in several different product categories including baseload (around the clock generation), intermediate (generation typically more expensive than baseload and utilized during higher demand periods to meet shifting demand needs), and peaking energy (most expensive variable cost and utilized during the highest demand periods), for which the latter is provided by some of our stand-alone peaking power plants/units and from our combined-cycle power plants by using technologies such as steam injection or duct firing additional burners in the heat recovery steam generators.


• | Second, we provide capacity for sale to utilities, independent electric system operators and retail power providers. In various markets, retail power providers (or independent electric system operators on their behalf) are required to demonstrate adequate resources to meet their power sales commitments. To meet this obligation, they procure a market product known as capacity from power plant owners or resellers. Capacity auctions are held in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and certain Midwest regional markets. California has a bilateral capacity program. Texas does not presently have a capacity market or a requirement for retailers to ensure adequate resources.


• | Third, we sell RECs from our Geysers Assets in northern California. California has an RPS that requires load serving entities to have RECs for a certain percentage of their demand for the purpose of guaranteeing a certain level of renewable generation in the state or in neighboring areas. Because geothermal is a renewable source of energy, we receive a REC for each MWh we produce and are able to sell our RECs to load serving entities. We also purchase RECs from other sources for resale to our customers.


• | Fourth, our cogeneration power plants produce steam, in addition to electricity, for sale to industrial customers for use in their manufacturing processes or heating, ventilation and air conditioning operations.


• | Fifth, we provide ancillary service products to wholesale power markets. These products include the right for the purchaser to call on our generation to provide flexibility to the market and support operation of the electric grid.

In addition to the five products above, we are buyers and sellers of emission allowances and credits, including those under California’s AB 32 GHG reduction program, Massachusetts’ CO2 reduction program, RGGI, the federal Acid Rain and CSAPR programs and emission reduction credits under the federal Nonattainment New Source Review program.
Although all of the products mentioned above contribute to our financial performance and are the primary components of our Commodity Margin, the most important are our sales of wholesale power and capacity. We utilize long-term customer contracts for our power and steam sales where possible. For power and capacity that are not sold under customer contracts or longer-dated capacity auctions, we use our hedging program and retail channels and sell power into shorter term markets throughout the regions in which we participate.

The Price and Supply of Natural Gas
Approximately 96%, or 25,558 MW, of our generating capability’s fuel requirements are met with natural gas. We have approximately 725 MW of baseload capacity from our Geysers Assets and our expectation is that the steam reservoir at our Geysers Assets will be able to supply economic quantities of steam for the foreseeable future as our steam flow decline rates have become very small over the past several years. We also have approximately 391 MW of capacity from power plants where we purchase fuel oil to meet generation requirements, but generally do not expect fuel oil requirements to be material to our portfolio of power plants. In our East segment, where the supply of natural gas can be constrained under some weather circumstances, we have approximately 6,900 MW of dual-fueled capable power plants. Additionally, we have 4 MW of capacity from solar power generation technology with no fuel requirement.
We procure natural gas from multiple suppliers and transportation and storage sources. Although availability is generally not an issue, localized shortages (especially in extreme weather conditions in and around population centers), transportation availability and supplier financial stability issues can and do occur. When natural gas supply is tight, some of our power plants benefit from the ability to operate on fuel oil instead of natural gas.
The price of natural gas, economic growth and environmental regulations affect our Commodity Margin and liquidity. The effect of changes in natural gas prices differs according to the time horizon and regional market conditions and depends on our hedge levels and other factors discussed below.
Much of our generating capacity is located in California (included in our West segment), Texas (included in our Texas segment) and the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic (included in our East segment) where natural gas-fired units set power prices during many hours. When natural gas is the price-setting fuel (i.e., natural gas prices are above coal prices in our Texas or East segments), increases in natural gas prices may increase our unhedged Commodity Margin because our combined-cycle power plants in those markets are more fuel-efficient than conventional natural gas-fired technologies and peaking power plants. Conversely, decreases in natural gas prices may decrease our unhedged Commodity Margin. In these instances, our cost of production advantage relative to less efficient natural gas-fired generation is diminished on an absolute basis until the point we are cheaper than coal on marginal economics. Additionally, in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, we have generating units capable of burning either natural gas or fuel oil. For these units, on the rare occasions when the cost of consuming natural gas is excessively high relative to fuel oil, our unhedged Commodity Margin may increase as a result of our ability to use the lower cost fuel.
Where we operate under long-term contracts, changes in natural gas prices can have a neutral effect on us in the short-term. This tends to be the case where we have entered into tolling agreements under which the customer provides the natural gas and we convert it to power for a fee, or where we enter into indexed-based agreements with a contractual Heat Rate at or near our actual Heat Rate for a monthly payment.
Changes in natural gas prices or power prices may also affect our liquidity. During periods of high or volatile natural gas or power prices, we could be required to post additional cash collateral or letters of credit.
Weather Patterns and Natural Events
Weather generally has a significant short-term effect on supply and demand for power and natural gas. Historically, demand for and the price of power is higher in the summer and winter seasons when temperatures are more extreme, and therefore, our unhedged revenues and Commodity Margin could be negatively affected by relatively cool summers or mild winters. However, our geographically diverse portfolio mitigates the effect on our Commodity Margin of weather in specific regions of the U.S. Additionally, a disproportionate amount of our total revenue is usually realized during the summer months of our third fiscal quarter. We expect this trend to continue in the future as U.S. demand for power generally peaks during this time.
Operating Heat Rate and Availability
Our fleet is modern and more efficient than the average generation fleet; accordingly, we run more and earn incremental margin in markets where less efficient natural gas units frequently set the power price. In such cases, our unhedged Commodity Margin is positively correlated with how much more efficient our fleet is than our competitors’ fleets and with higher natural gas prices. Efficient operation of our fleet creates the opportunity to capture Commodity Margin in a cost effective manner. However, unplanned outages during periods when Commodity Margin is positive could result in a loss of that opportunity. We generally measure our fleet performance based on our availability factors, operating Heat Rate and operating and maintenance expense. The higher our availability factor, the better positioned we are to capture Commodity Margin. The lower our operating Heat Rate compared to the Market Heat Rate, the more favorable the effect on our Commodity Margin.

Regulatory and Environmental Trends
For a discussion of federal, state and regional legislative and regulatory initiatives and how they might affect us, see “— Governmental and Regulatory Matters.” It is very difficult to predict the continued evolution of our markets due to the uncertainty of various risk factors which could affect our business. A description of these risk factors is included under Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Competition
Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive, commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants. We compete against other independent power producers, power marketers and trading companies, including those owned by financial institutions, retail load aggregators, municipalities, retail power providers, cooperatives and regulated utilities to supply power and power-related products to our customers in major markets in the U.S. and Canada. In addition, in some markets, we compete against some of our customers.
In markets with centralized ISOs, such as California, Texas, the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, our natural gas-fired power plants compete directly with all other sources of power. The EIA estimates that in 2018, 35% of the power generated in the U.S. was fueled by natural gas, 28% by coal, 19% by nuclear facilities and the remaining 18% of power generated by hydroelectric, fuel oil, geothermal and other energy sources. We are subject to complex and stringent energy, environmental and other governmental laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels in connection with the development, ownership and operation of our power plants. For a further discussion of the environmental and other governmental regulations that affect us, see “— Governmental and Regulatory Matters.”
Competition from renewable generation is likely to increase in the future. Federal and state financial incentives and RPS requirements continue to foster renewables development.
Retail electricity and natural gas is similarly a commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants. We compete against other integrated power companies, regulated utilities, other retail power providers, brokers, trading companies including those owned by financial institutions, retail load aggregators, municipalities and cooperatives to supply power and power-related products to our customers in major markets in the U.S. and Canada. 
MARKETING, HEDGING AND OPTIMIZATION ACTIVITIES
Our commercial hedging and optimization strategies are designed to maximize our risk-adjusted Commodity Margin by leveraging our knowledge, experience and fundamental views on natural gas and power. Additionally, we seek strong bilateral relationships with load serving entities that can benefit us and our customers. Our retail portfolio has been established to provide an additional source of liquidity for our generation fleet as we hedge retail load from our wholesale generation assets as appropriate. 
The majority of our risk exposures arise from our ownership and operation of power plants. Our primary risk exposures are Spark Spread, power prices, natural gas prices, capacity prices, locational price differences in power and in natural gas, natural gas transportation, electric transmission, REC prices, carbon allowance prices in California and the Northeast and other emissions credit prices. In addition to the direct risk exposure to commodity prices, we also have general market risks such as risk related to performance of our counterparties and customers and plant operating performance risk. 
Our operations are commodity intensive. We produced approximately 98 billion KWh of electricity in 2018 across North America and consumed approximately 756 Bcf of natural gas, making us one of the largest producers of electricity and consumers of natural gas in North America. Additionally, our retail affiliates provided approximately 62 billion KWh to customers in 2018. We actively manage our commodity risk exposures with a variety of physical and financial instruments with varying time horizons. These instruments include PPAs, tolling arrangements, Heat Rate swaps and options, retail power sales including through our retail subsidiaries, steam sales, buying and selling standard physical power and natural gas products, buying and selling exchange traded instruments, buying and selling environmental and capacity products, natural gas transportation and storage arrangements, electric transmission service and other contracts for the sale and purchase of power products. We utilize these instruments to maximize the risk-adjusted returns for our Commodity Margin. 
At any point in time, the relative quantity of our products hedged or sold under longer-term contracts is determined by the availability of forward product sales opportunities and our view of the attractiveness of the pricing available for forward sales. We have economically hedged a portion of our expected generation and natural gas portfolio as well as retail load supply obligations, where appropriate, mostly through power and natural gas forward physical and financial transactions including retail power sales; however, we currently remain susceptible to significant price movements for 2019 and beyond. When we elect to enter into these transactions, we are able to economically hedge a portion of our Spark Spread at pre-determined generation and price levels. 
We conduct our hedging and optimization activities within a structured risk management framework based on controls, policies and procedures. We monitor these activities through active and ongoing management and oversight, defined roles and 
 6

responsibilities, and daily risk estimates and reporting. Additionally, we seek to manage the associated risks through diversification, by controlling position sizes, by using portfolio position limits, and by actively managing hedge positions to lock in margin. We are exposed to commodity price movements (both profits and losses) in connection with these transactions. These positions are included in and subject to our consolidated risk management portfolio position limits and controls structure. Our future hedged status and marketing and optimization activities are subject to change as determined by our commercial operations group, Chief Risk Officer, senior management and Board of Directors. For control purposes, we have VAR limits that govern the overall risk of our portfolio of power plants, energy contracts, financial hedging transactions and other contracts. Our VAR limits, transaction approval limits and other risk related controls are dictated by our Risk Management Policy which is approved by our Board of Directors and by a committee comprised of members of our senior management and administered by our Chief Risk Officer’s organization. The Chief Risk Officer’s organization is segregated from the commercial operations and retail units and reports directly to our Audit Committee and Chief Financial Officer. Our Risk Management Policy is primarily designed to provide us with a degree of protection from significant downside commodity price risk exposure to our cash flows.
We have historically used interest rate hedging instruments to adjust the mix between our fixed and variable rate debt. To the extent eligible, our interest rate hedging instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges, and changes in fair value are recorded in OCI to the extent they are effective with gains and losses reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.

Power Plants in Operation
We own 79 power plants with an aggregate generation capacity of 26,678 MW. 
Natural Gas-Fired Fleet
Our natural gas-fired power plants primarily utilize two types of designs: 2,143 MW of simple-cycle combustion turbines and 23,081 MW of combined-cycle combustion turbines and a small portion from conventional natural gas/oil-fired boilers with steam turbines. Simple-cycle combustion turbines burn natural gas or fuel oil to spin an electric generator to produce power. A combined-cycle unit combusts fuel like a simple-cycle combustion turbine and the exhaust heat is captured by a heat recovery boiler to create steam which can then spin a steam turbine. Simple-cycle turbines are easier to maintain, but combined-cycle turbines operate with much higher efficiency. Each of our power plants currently in operation is capable of producing power for sale to a utility, another third-party end user, our retail customers or an intermediary such as a marketing company. At 15 of our power plants, we also produce thermal energy (primarily steam and chilled water), which can be sold to industrial and governmental users. These plants are called combined heat and power facilities.
Our Steam Adjusted Heat Rate for 2018 for the power plants we operate was 7,353 Btu/KWh which results in a power conversion efficiency of approximately 46%. The power conversion efficiency is a measure of how efficiently a fossil fuel power plant converts thermal energy to electrical energy. Our Steam Adjusted Heat Rate includes all fuel required to dispatch our power plants including “start-up” and “shut-down” fuel, as well as all non-steady state operations. Once our power plants achieve steady state operations, our combined-cycle power plants achieve an average power conversion efficiency of approximately 50%. Additionally, we also sell steam from our combined heat and power plants, which improves our power conversion efficiency in steady state operations from these power plants to an average of approximately 53%. Due to our modern combustion turbine fleet, our power conversion efficiency is significantly better than that of older technology natural gas-fired power plants and coal-fired power plants, which typically have power conversion efficiencies that range from 28% to 36%.
Our natural gas fleet is relatively young with a weighted average age, based upon MW capacities in operation, of approximately 18 years.
Geothermal Fleet
Our Geysers Assets are a 725 MW fleet of 13 operating power plants in northern California. Geothermal power is considered renewable energy because the steam harnessed to power our turbines is produced inside the Earth and does not require burning fuel. The steam is produced below the Earth’s surface from reservoirs of hot water, both naturally occurring and injected. The steam is piped directly from the underground production wells to the power plants and used to spin turbines to generate power. For the past 18 years, our Geysers Assets have reliably generated, on average, approximately six million MWh of renewable power per year. Unlike other renewable resources such as wind or sunlight, which depend on intermittent sources to generate power, geothermal power provides a consistent source of energy as evidenced by our Geysers Assets’ availability of approximately 94% in 2018. The sale of RECs to customers is an important separate income stream for our Geysers Assets.
We inject water back into the steam reservoir, which extends the useful life of the resource and helps to maintain the output of our Geysers Assets. The water we inject comes from the condensate associated with the steam extracted to generate power, wells and creeks, as well as water purchase agreements for reclaimed water. We receive and inject an average of approximately 15 million gallons of reclaimed water per day into the geothermal steam reservoir at The Geysers where the water is naturally heated by the Earth, creating additional steam to fuel our Geysers Assets. Approximately 11 million gallons per day are received from the Santa Rosa Geysers Recharge Project, which we developed jointly with the City of Santa Rosa, and we receive, on average, approximately four million gallons a day from The Lake County Recharge Project from Lake County. As a result of these recharge projects, MWh production has been relatively constant. We expect that, as a result of the water injection program, the reservoir at our Geysers Assets will be able to supply economic quantities of steam for the foreseeable future.
We periodically review our geothermal studies to help us assess the economic life of our geothermal reserves. Our most recent geothermal reserve study was conducted in 2018. Our evaluation of our geothermal reserves, including our review of any applicable independent studies conducted, indicated that our Geysers Assets should continue to supply sufficient steam to generate positive cash flows at least through 2078. In reaching this conclusion, our evaluation, consistent with the due diligence study of 2018, assumes that defined “proved reserves” are those quantities of geothermal energy which, by analysis of geological and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable, from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under current economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations.
We lease the geothermal steam fields from which we extract steam for our Geysers Assets. We have leasehold mineral interests in 105 leases comprising approximately 28,000 acres of federal, state and private geothermal resource lands in The Geysers region of northern California. Our leases cover one contiguous area of property that comprises approximately 45 square 
 9

miles in the northwest corner of Sonoma County and southeast corner of Lake County. The approximate breakout by volume of steam removed under the above leases for the year ended 2018 is:

• | 27% related to leases with the federal government via the Office of Natural Resources Revenue,


• | 30% related to leases with the California State Lands Commission and


• | 43% related to leases with private landowners/leaseholders.

In general, our geothermal leases grant us the exclusive right to drill for, produce and sell geothermal resources from these properties and the right to use the surface for all related purposes. Each lease requires the payment of annual rent until commercial quantities of geothermal resources are established. After such time, the leases require the payment of minimum advance royalties or other payments until production commences, at which time production royalties are payable on a monthly basis from 10 to 31 days (depending upon the lease terms) following the close of the production month. Such royalties and other payments are payable to landowners, state and federal agencies and others, and vary widely as to the particular lease. In general, royalties payable are calculated based upon a percentage of total gross revenue received by us associated with our geothermal leases. Each lease’s royalty calculation is based upon its percentage of revenue as calculated by its steam generated relative to the total steam generated by our Geysers Assets as a whole.
Our geothermal leases are generally for initial terms varying from five to 20 years and for so long thereafter as geothermal resources are produced and sold. Most of our geothermal leases were signed in excess of 30 years ago. Our federal leases are, in general, for an initial 10-year period with renewal clauses for an additional 40 years for a maximum of 50 years. The 50-year term expires in 2024 for four of our federal leases. However, our federal leases allow for a preferential right to renewal for a second 40-year term on such terms and conditions as the lessor deems appropriate if, at the end of the initial 40-year term, geothermal steam is being produced or utilized in commercial quantities. The majority of our other leases run through the economic life of our Geysers Assets and provide for renewals so long as geothermal resources are being produced or utilized, or are capable of being produced or utilized, in commercial quantities from the leased land or from land unitized with the leased land. Although we believe that we will be able to renew our leases through the economic life of our Geysers Assets on terms that are acceptable to us, it is possible that certain of our leases may not be renewed, or may be renewable only on less favorable terms.
In addition, we hold 40 geothermal leases comprising approximately 43,840 acres of federal geothermal resource lands in the Glass Mountain area in northern California, which is separate from The Geysers region. Four test production wells were drilled prior to our acquisition of these leases and we have drilled one test well since their acquisition, which produced commercial quantities of steam during flow tests. However, the properties subject to these leases have not been developed and there can be no assurance that these leases will ultimately be developed.
Other Power Generation Technologies
We also have 725 MW of older, less efficient technology at our Edge Moor Energy Center which has conventional steam turbine technology. We also have 4 MW of capacity from solar power generation technology at our Vineland Solar Energy Center in New Jersey.
Retail Operations
Our retail segment provides energy and related services to commercial, industrial, governmental and residential customers through our retail subsidiaries which consist of Calpine Solutions and Champion Energy (including North American Power). Our retail operations have an overlapping presence with our wholesale business in California, Texas and the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S and provided approximately 62 billion KWh to customers in 2018 consisting of approximately 6.2 million annualized residential customer equivalents. Thus, our retail segment geographically and strategically complements our wholesale generation fleet providing access to forward market liquidity through both direct and mass market retail sales channels.

Substantially all of the power plants in which we have an interest are located on sites which we either own or lease on a long-term basis.
GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS
We are subject to complex and stringent energy, environmental and other laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels as well as within the RTO and ISO markets in which we participate in connection with the development, ownership and operation of our power plants. Federal and state legislative and regulatory actions, including those by ISO/RTOs, continue to have an effect on our business. Some of the more significant governmental and regulatory matters that affect our business are discussed below.
 13

Power and Natural Gas Matters
Federal Regulation of Power
FERC Jurisdiction
The Federal Power Act (“FPA”) grants the federal government broad authority over electric utilities and independent power producers, and vests its authority in the FERC. Unless otherwise exempt, any person that owns or operates facilities used for the wholesale sale or transmission of power in interstate commerce is a public utility subject to FERC’s jurisdiction. The FERC governs, among other things, the disposition of certain utility property, the issuance of securities by public utilities, the rates, the terms and conditions for the transmission or wholesale sale of power in interstate commerce, the interlocking directorates, and the uniform system of accounts and reporting requirements for public utilities.
Our power plants, outside of ERCOT, are subject to FERC’s jurisdiction as either exempt wholesale generators (“EWGs”) under the FPA or QFs under PURPA. Most of our affiliates have been granted authority to sell power at market-based rates and have been granted certain waivers of FERC reporting and accounting regulations. However, we cannot assure that such authorities or waivers will not be revoked in the future for these affiliates.
The FERC has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of Part II of the FPA, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. The FERC is authorized to assess a maximum civil penalty of approximately $1.27 million per violation for each day that the violation continues. The FPA also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under Part II of the FPA. This penalty authority was enhanced in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”).
Pursuant to EPAct 2005, NERC has been certified by the FERC as the Electric Reliability Organization to develop and enforce reliability standards and critical infrastructure protection standards, which protect the bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches. The NERC standards are applicable throughout the U.S. and are subject to FERC review and approval. FERC-approved reliability standards may be enforced by the FERC independently, or, alternatively, by the NERC and the regional reliability organizations with frontline responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to the FERC’s oversight. The critical infrastructure protection standards focus on controlling access to critical physical and cybersecurity assets, including supervisory control and data acquisition systems for the electric grid. Compliance with these standards is mandatory. Monetary penalties of approximately $1.27 million per day per violation may be assessed for violations of the reliability and critical infrastructure protection standards. 
U.S. Department of Energy
The U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) has initiated a formal inter-agency review process to consider possible action under Section 202(c) of the FPA and the Defense Production Act to ensure the continued operation of certain fuel-secure electric generation capacity, consisting of nuclear and coal-fired power plants across the U.S. facing retirement. The review process is being conducted on the basis that these uneconomic power resources are needed to provide reliability and resiliency to the U.S. power system because their on-site fuel better equips them to withstand extreme weather events and cyber attacks. We and others are advocating against any such action and believe if such actions are permitted to be implemented, prices could be negatively affected. We cannot predict what action, if any, the DOE may take in response to this request, nor can we predict what effect such action would have on our business.
State Regulation of Power
State Public Utility Commissions, or PUC(s), have historically had broad authority to regulate both the rates charged by, and the financial activities of, electric utilities operating in their states and to promulgate regulation for implementation of PURPA. Since all of our affiliates are either QFs or EWGs, none of our affiliates are currently subject to direct rate regulation by a state PUC. However, states may assert jurisdiction over the siting and construction of power generating facilities including QFs and EWGs and, with the exception of QFs, over the issuance of securities and the sale or other transfer of assets by these facilities. State PUCs also maintain extensive control over the procurement of wholesale power by the utilities that they regulate. Many of these utilities are our customers, and agreements between us and these counterparties often require approval by state PUCs.
 14

Power Regions
The following is a brief overview of our core power regions – CAISO, ERCOT, PJM, ISO-NE and NYISO. The CAISO market is in our West segment. The ERCOT market is in our Texas segment. The PJM, ISO-NE and NYISO markets are in our East segment. These markets are constantly evolving in response to external factors that may disrupt the competitive balance within the wholesale markets.
Recently, several initiatives at the state and regional levels to provide out-of-market financial subsidies to certain generation resources in states and power regions with competitive wholesale markets threaten to undermine the operation of these power markets. Some of these initiatives have been enacted while others are currently being developed for future implementation. If these anticompetitive actions are ultimately upheld and implemented, they could adversely affect capacity and energy prices in the deregulated electricity markets which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and financial results.
CAISO
The majority of our power plants in our West segment are located in California, in the CAISO region. We also own one power plant in Arizona and one in Oregon. CAISO is responsible for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of the transmission grid within the bulk of California and providing open, nondiscriminatory transmission services. CAISO maintains various markets for wholesale sales of power, differentiated by time and type of electrical service, into which our subsidiaries may sell power from time to time. These markets are subject to various controls, such as price caps and mitigation of bids when transmission constraints arise. The controls and the markets themselves are subject to regulatory change at any time. 
ERCOT
ERCOT is the ISO that manages approximately 90% of Texas’ load and an electric grid covering about 75% of the state, overseeing transactions associated with Texas’ competitive wholesale and retail power markets. FERC does not regulate wholesale sales of power in ERCOT. The PUCT exercises regulatory jurisdiction over the rates and services of any electric utility conducting business within Texas. Our subsidiaries that own power plants in Texas have power generation company status at the PUCT, and are either EWGs or QFs and are exempt from PUCT rate regulation. ERCOT ensures resource adequacy through an energy-only model. In ERCOT, there is a market offer price cap for energy and capacity services purchased by ERCOT. Under certain market conditions, the offer cap could be lower. Our subsidiaries are subject to the offer cap rules, but only for sales of power and capacity services to ERCOT.
The PUCT recently approved changes to energy price formation and scarcity pricing. These changes affect the shape of the Operating Reserve Demand Curve (“ORDC”), which produces a price “adder” to the clearing price of energy that increases as reserve capacity declines. The effect of these changes to the ORDC is to produce a slightly more robust price signal than previously existed as reserve capacity declines. 
PJM
PJM operates wholesale power markets, a locationally based energy market, a forward capacity market and ancillary service markets. PJM also performs transmission planning and operation for the region. The rules and regulations affecting PJM power markets and transmission are subject to change at any time.
On June 29, 2018, the FERC issued a decision finding PJM’s current tariff to be unjust and unreasonable due to the price-suppressive effects of out-of-market compensation provided to certain generation resources by states within the PJM market. The FERC rejected both replacement proposals submitted by PJM to address the issue and instead opted for an expedited paper hearing to identify a reasonable replacement mechanism. In its decision, the FERC outlined a Fixed Resource Requirement Alternative (“FRR Alternative”) in which power resources receiving out-of-market subsidies could choose to be removed from the PJM market along with a commensurate amount of load. PJM made a Compliance Filing on October 2, 2018 to implement the FERC’s proposed FRR Alternative, which we do not support. In the same Compliance Filing, however, PJM also included additional market rule changes we do support that would partially mitigate the impact of out-of-market subsidies on wholesale capacity market prices. As this issue is unresolved, we cannot predict the ultimate effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
ISO-NE
 We have three power plants in our East segment located in Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire, all of which participate in the regional wholesale market in which ISO-NE is the RTO. ISO-NE has broad authority over the day-to-day operation of the transmission system and, among other responsibilities, operates a day-ahead and real-time wholesale energy market, a forward capacity market and an ancillary services market.
 15

In response to reliability concerns related to fuel security in the New England region, ISO-NE filed a proposal with the FERC in mid-2018 that would allow it to retain certain generators under cost-of-service RMR Contracts that it believes are necessary to ensure fuel security on the system. The only units ISO-NE has contracted with to date are Mystic Units 8 and 9 (the “Mystic Units”). Included in ISO-NE’s proposal is a requirement that the cost-of-service units participate in ISO-NE’s forward capacity auction (“FCA”) as price takers. The Mystic Units were price takers in the recently concluded FCA 13. Calpine and many other generators opposed ISO-NE’s proposal, arguing that having these generators act as price takers will suppress capacity market clearing prices. The FERC rejected the price suppression concerns and accepted ISO-NE’s filing on December 3, 2018. Several companies have sought rehearing of the FERC’s decision.  
ISO-NE concedes that treating the cost-of-service units (i.e., the Mystic Units) as price takers in the FCA suppresses clearing prices, and is conducting stakeholder meetings to develop an interim, administrative mechanism to provide additional compensation to all generators that provide fuel security to the system. Additionally, ISO-NE has committed to the FERC to develop a long-term market-based solution to incent and retain fuel secure resources and is conducting stakeholder meetings to develop a solution. ISO-NE intends to submit this long-term solution to the FERC by November 15, 2019. Stakeholder meetings are continuing.
NYISO
We have five power plants in our East segment located in New York where NYISO is the RTO which manages the transmission system in New York and operates the state’s wholesale power markets. NYISO manages both day-ahead and real-time energy markets using a locationally based marginal pricing mechanism that pays each generator the zonal marginally accepted bid price for the energy it produces. NYISO also manages a forward capacity market where capacity prices are determined through auctions.
Regulation of Transportation and Sale of Natural Gas
Since the majority of our power generating capacity is derived from natural gas-fired power plants, we are broadly affected by federal regulation of natural gas transportation and sales. We own two pipelines in Texas that are subject to the Texas Railroad Commission regulation as Texas gas utilities. 
We also operate a proprietary pipeline system in California, which is regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration with regard to safety matters. Additionally, some of our power plants own and operate short pipeline laterals that connect the natural gas-fired power plants to the North American natural gas grid. Some of these laterals are subject to state and/or federal safety regulations.
The FERC has civil penalty authority for violations of the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”) and Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”), as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. The FERC’s regulations specifically prohibit the manipulation of the natural gas markets by making it unlawful for any entity in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas, or the purchase or sale of transportation service under the FERC’s jurisdiction, to engage in fraudulent or deceptive practices. Similar to its penalty authority under the FPA described above, the FERC is authorized to assess a maximum civil penalty of approximately $1.27 million per violation for each day that the violation continues. The NGA and NGPA also provide for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment time for violations.
Federal Regulation of Futures and Other Derivatives
CFTC Regulation of Futures Transactions
The CFTC has regulatory oversight of the futures markets, including trading on NYMEX for energy, and licensed futures professionals such as brokers, clearing members and large traders. In connection with its oversight of the futures markets and NYMEX, the CFTC regularly investigates market irregularities and potential manipulation of those markets. Recent laws also give the CFTC certain powers with respect to broker-type markets referred to as “exempt commercial markets” or ECMs, including the Intercontinental Exchange. The CFTC monitors activities in the OTC, ECM and physical markets that may be undertaken for the purpose of influencing futures prices. With respect to ECMs, the CFTC exercises only light-handed regulation primarily related to trade reporting, price dissemination and record retention (including retention of fraudulent claims and allegations).

Environmental Matters
Federal Air Emissions Regulations
CAA
The CAA provides for the regulation of air quality and air emissions, largely through state implementation of federal requirements. We believe that all of our operating power plants comply with existing federal and state performance standards mandated under the CAA. In addition to regulation of air emissions at the federal level, a number of states in which we do business have implemented regulations that go beyond current federal environmental requirements. We continue to monitor and actively participate in federal and state initiatives which further our environmental and business objectives and where we anticipate an effect on our business.
The CAA requires the EPA to regulate emissions of pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. The EPA has set NAAQS for six “criteria” pollutants: carbon monoxide, lead, NO2, particulate matter, ozone and SO2. In addition, the CAA regulates a large number of air pollutants that are known to cause or may reasonably be anticipated to cause adverse effects to human health or adverse environmental effects, known as hazardous air pollutants (“HAPs”). The EPA is required to issue technology-based national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants (“NESHAPs”) to limit the release of specified HAPs from specific industrial sectors. The EPA also regulates emissions of certain pollutants that affect visibility in national parks and wilderness areas (“Regional Haze”). Finally, the EPA has begun regulating GHG emissions from various industries, including the power sector. 
CAA regulations primarily affect higher-emitting units in the national power generating fleet. Our commitment to environmental stewardship is reflected in our history of investing in low-emitting power plant technologies. As a result, these regulations generally do not have a meaningful, direct adverse effect on our generating fleet, although they may impose significant costs on the power industry overall. 
NAAQS — Ozone 
As part of its ongoing CAA obligation to periodically review NAAQS to ensure that air quality is protective of human health and the environment, on October 1, 2015, the EPA set a new standard for ground-level of ozone of 70 parts per billion, down from the standard set in 2008 of 75 parts per billion. This is significant to the power sector because ground-level ozone is a product of complex chemical reactions contributed to by NOx, which are one of the primary emissions of concern from power plants. 
Air quality in the Houston area, where six of our power plants are located, has improved over the last two decades. As a result, the Houston area was determined by the EPA to be attaining the 1-hour ozone standard, effective November 19, 2015, and the 1997 8-hour ozone standard, effective January 29, 2016. The Houston area remains in nonattainment relative to the 2008 ozone standard, and in fact, was downgraded in overall status relative to that standard on December 14, 2016. The area’s status has not yet been determined for the 2015 ozone standard, but is likely to be in nonattainment as well, which could lead to further, more stringent regulation of NOx emissions from mobile sources and a number of industry sources, particularly the power industry.
Pursuant to authority granted under the CAA, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality adopted regulations to attain the earlier NAAQS for ozone including the establishment of a Cap-and-Trade program for NOx emitted by power plants in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria ozone nonattainment area. We own and operate six power plants that participate in this program, all of which received free NOx allowances based on historical operating profiles. At this time, our Houston-area power plants have sufficient NOx allowances to meet forecasted obligations under the program. Due to the more stringent ozone standard promulgated in 2015, allowable NOx emissions under this program could be reduced at some point in the future, which could cause us to incur additional compliance costs. However, we cannot estimate such costs until such program changes are proposed and finalized.
Regional Haze
The EPA first issued the Regional Haze rule in 1999, with a focus on emissions of SO2, NOx, and particulate matter, particularly PM2.5. The Regional Haze program includes two major components: demonstration of Reasonable Further Progress, and installation of Best Achievable Retrofit Technology (“BART”). States submit State Implementation Plans (“SIP”) to the EPA for approval. These SIPs delineate all of the relevant emission controls programs in the state, and demonstrate that the state is making reasonable progress toward the Regional Haze program visibility goals. In addition, states must require the installation of a minimum level of controls that are considered cost-effective on coal- and oil-fired power plants within the state. In the eastern U.S., regional NOx and SO2 programs are relied upon in Regional Haze SIPs to achieve much of the required emission reductions, 
 17

and are also allowed by EPA policy to substitute for the installation of BART. If the EPA does not approve a SIP, it may instead issue a Federal Implementation Plan, which will specify the control requirements for sources in a state. 
GHG Emissions
Over the past several years, the EPA has proposed and issued rules related to GHG emissions within the power sector. The current presidential administration, however, has not indicated support for some of these rules, including, most notably, the Clean Power Plan. 
The EPA’s regulation of GHG in response to the 2007 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. EPA has been controversial and heavily litigated at every step of the regulatory process. Within the power industry, the EPA first proposed to regulate GHG emissions through the PSD and Title V programs, the two major permitting programs of the CAA. 
These permitting rules were the subject of more than 60 petitions for review by industry and the states. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately heard the case, and on June 23, 2014, rejected the PSD and Title V permitting rules in part but upheld the EPA’s authority to impose GHG limits on large new or modified sources if such sources were required to obtain permits for other pollutants. Our clean portfolio and additions thereto generally meet the technology that would be required if they triggered PSD permitting requirements. Therefore, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from this regulatory development. 
On October 23, 2015, the EPA finalized the New Source Performance Standard (“NSPS”) for GHG emissions from new, modified and reconstructed power plants and the Clean Power Plan. The Clean Power Plan requires a reduction in GHG emissions from existing power plants of 32% from 2005 levels by 2030. We believe that we are positioned to comply with the guidelines of the Clean Power Plan. Litigation challenging the Clean Power Plan is ongoing. The current Presidential administration is taking action to replace the Clean Power Plan upon the basis that it exceeds the EPA’s authority. If the EPA successfully replaces the Clean Power Plan with other emissions guidelines, it is unclear what effect, if any, such emissions guidelines would have on our business.
State Air Emissions Regulations
In addition to federal GHG rules, several states and regional organizations have developed state-specific or regional initiatives to reduce GHG emissions through mandatory programs. The most advanced programs include California’s suite of GHG policies promulgated pursuant to AB 32, including its Cap-and-Trade program, Massachusetts’ CO2 reduction program and RGGI in the Northeast. The evolution of these programs could have a material effect on our business.
In these programs, a cap is established defining the maximum allowable emissions of GHGs emitted by sources subject to the program. Affected sources are required to hold one allowance for each ton of CO2 emitted (and, in the case of California’s program, other GHGs) during the applicable compliance period. Both programs also contain provisions for the use of qualified offsets in lieu of allowances. Allowances are distributed through auctions or through allocations to affected companies. In addition, there are functional secondary markets for allowances. We obtain allowances in a variety of ways, including through bilateral or exchange transactions and pursuant to the terms of PPAs.
California: GHG - Cap-and-Trade Regulation
 California’s climate policies and GHG reduction targets are among the most ambitious and aggressive in the world. Assembly Bill (“AB”) 32, as amended by Senate Bill (“SB”) 32 in 2016, requires California to reduce statewide GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and to at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. To meet this mandate, the CARB has promulgated a suite of complementary regulatory measures, including the Cap-and-Trade Regulation and Mandatory Reporting Regulation. Covered entities, such as our power plants, must surrender compliance instruments, which include both allowances and offset credits, in an amount equivalent to their GHG emissions. AB 398, enacted in 2017, authorized extension of the Cap-and-Trade Regulation through 2030. 
AB 398 required several changes in the post-2020 Cap-and-Trade Regulation, including a requirement that CARB impose a price ceiling and two reserve tiers to control the pace of price increases, as well as limitations on the percentage of offset credits that covered entities can surrender to meet their compliance obligation. In subsequently adopting regulatory amendments to implement AB 398’s mandates, the CARB adopted an initial price ceiling value for 2021 at $65, which will increase each year by five percent plus the rate of inflation. Assuming an annual inflation rate of two percent, the 2030 price ceiling will approach $119, above which an unlimited number of additional metric tons will be available to covered entities if needed for compliance.
Several of our natural gas-fired power plants in California will likely remain subject to the Cap-and-Trade Regulation through 2030 as a result of passage of AB 398, although we believe the net effect of the Cap-and-Trade Regulation will be beneficial to us.

Northeast GHG Regulation: RGGI
Nine states in the Northeast participate in RGGI, a Cap-and-Trade program, which affects our power plants in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Delaware (together emitting about 5.4 million tons of CO2 annually). The governors of New Jersey and Virginia are currently taking actions to have their states join RGGI.
We receive annual allocations from New York’s long-term contract set-aside pool to cover some of the CO2 emissions attributable to our PPAs at both the Kennedy International Airport Power Plant and Stony Brook Power Plant. We do not anticipate any significant business or financial effect from RGGI, given the efficiency of our power plants in RGGI states.
Massachusetts: Global Warming Solutions Act
On December 16, 2016, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection proposed regulations that would impose new GHG limits on power plants and other sources. These regulations are notable because they are structured as annually-declining hard caps on CO2 emissions from regulated facilities. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection issued a final rule on August 11, 2017, which became effective on January 1, 2018. The rule establishes an allowance trading system under which we were granted allowances. Although we view the regulations as likely to result in market distortions impeding the efficient operation of both power and emissions markets, we believe that we will be able to comply with its provisions.
Oregon: GHG – Cap and Invest Legislation
Recently introduced legislation, HB 2020, would create a GHG “cap and invest” trading program comparable in structure to the California Cap-and-Trade Program and designed to link with the Western Climate Initiative jurisdictions implementing linked GHG trading programs, which currently consist of California and Québec. If enacted, the newly created Climate Policy Office would then develop regulations to implement program elements in more specific detail, with the goal of holding joint auctions with the other linked jurisdictions. The program would run from 2021 through 2050, with constant declines in annual allowance budgets to achieve a 45 percent reduction in GHG emissions below 1990 levels by 2035, and an 80 percent reduction below 1990 levels by 2050 within capped sectors. 
Our Hermiston Power Project would be subject to the program and required to provide compliance instruments for its GHG emissions under HB 2020 as introduced. As the legislative session is still ongoing, we cannot predict the ultimate effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Other Environmental Regulations
RPS
We are subject to an RPS in multiple states in which we do business. Generally, an RPS requires each retail seller of electricity to include in its resource portfolio (the resources procured by the retail seller to supply its retail customers) a certain amount of power generated from renewable or clean energy resources by a certain date.
California RPS
California’s RPS requires retail power providers to generate or procure 33% and 60% of the power they sell to retail customers from renewable resources by 2020 and 2030, respectively, with intermediate targets leading up to 2020 and 2030. Behind-the-meter solar generally does not count towards California’s RPS requirements. Under California’s RPS, there are limits on different “buckets” of procurement that can be used to satisfy the RPS. Load-serving entities must satisfy a growing fraction of their compliance obligations with renewable power from resources located in California or delivered into California within the hour, such as our Geysers Assets. The law that increased the 2030 RPS target to 60%, SB 100, also sets a state policy that eligible renewable energy and zero-carbon resources supply 100% of all retail sales of electricity in California by 2045. While this goal is aspirational and the legislation does not establish an enforceable framework or mechanism by which it will be achieved, it will nevertheless guide procurement and planning decisions. In addition, a recently signed executive order articulates a carbon neutrality goal for the entire state, not just the electricity sector, by 2045, which is five years earlier than the existing target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 80% below 1990 levels. While the RPS generally depresses wholesale energy prices, the intermittency of many renewable resources raises operational flexibility challenges that present opportunities for natural gas-fired generation to provide capacity and ancillary services products. Additionally, the RPS could result in the retirement of non-renewable generating units creating opportunities for our fleet.
Other States
A number of additional states have an RPS in place. Existing state-specific RPS requirements may change due to regulatory and/or legislative initiatives, and other states may consider implementing an enforceable RPS in the future. Our retail subsidiaries

operate in states that have an RPS in place and are required to procure a certain amount of power from renewable sources or purchase renewable energy credits in order to comply with the RPS requirements.
Miscellaneous
In addition to controls on air emissions, our power plants and the equipment necessary to support them are subject to other extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations adopted for the protection of the environment and to regulate land use. The laws and regulations applicable to us primarily involve the discharge of wastewater and the use of water, but can also include wetlands protection and preservation, protection of endangered species, hazardous materials handling and disposal, waste disposal and noise regulations. Noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines or penalties. In some instances, environmental laws may also impose clean-up or other remedial obligations in the event of a release of pollutants or contaminants into the environment. The following federal laws are among the more significant environmental laws that apply to us. In most cases, analogous state laws also exist that may impose similar and, in some cases, more stringent requirements on us than those discussed below. In general, our relatively clean portfolio as compared to our competitors affords us some advantage in complying with these laws.
Clean Water Act 
The federal Clean Water Act establishes requirements relating to the discharge of pollutants into waters of the U.S., including from cooling water intake structures. Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse effects on the environment. We are required to obtain wastewater and storm water discharge permits for wastewater and runoff, respectively, for some of our power plants. We are subject to the requirements for cooling water intake structures at many of our power plants. In addition, we are required to maintain spill prevention control and countermeasure plans for some of our power plants. We do not use once-through cooling technology at any of the power plants in our fleet. We believe that our facilities that are subject to the Clean Water Act are in compliance with applicable discharge requirements of the Clean Water Act.
Safe Drinking Water Act
Part C of the Safe Drinking Water Act establishes the underground injection control program that regulates the disposal of wastes by means of deep well injection. Although geothermal production wells, which are wells that bring steam to the surface, are exempt under EPAct 2005, we use geothermal re-injection wells to inject reclaimed wastewater back into the steam reservoir, which are subject to the underground injection control program. We believe that we are in compliance with Part C of the Safe Drinking Water Act.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also referred to as the Superfund, requires cleanup of sites from which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous substances, and authorizes the EPA to take any necessary response action at Superfund sites, including ordering potentially responsible parties liable for the release to pay for such actions. Potentially responsible parties are broadly defined under CERCLA to include past and present owners and operators of, as well as generators of, wastes sent to a site. As of the filing of this Report, we are not subject to any material liability for any Superfund matters. However, we generate certain wastes, including hazardous wastes, and send these to third party waste disposal sites. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not incur a liability under CERCLA in the future.
EMPLOYEES
At December 31, 2018, we employed 2,282 full-time employees, of whom 167 were represented by collective bargaining agreements. One collective bargaining agreement, representing a total of 42 employees, will expire within one year. We have never experienced a work stoppage or a strike.
