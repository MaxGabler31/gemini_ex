Overview
For more than 100 years, business, government, and military leaders have turned to Booz Allen Hamilton to solve their most complex problems. A values-driven organization with a guiding purpose to empower people to change the world, we remain focused on providing long-term solutions to our clients' emerging and ever-changing challenges. Our people are passionate about their service to our clients and their missions and the communities in which we live and work. This is our heritage, and it is as true today as when the company was founded in 1914.
A collaborative culture is an integral part of our unique operating model, which encourages our people to bring a diversity of ideas and talent to every client engagement. Building on our legacy of passionate client service and guided by our comprehensive Vision 2020 strategy, we blend deep expertise in management consulting with advanced technical capabilities to deliver powerful solutions. By investing in markets, capabilities, and talent and building new business models, including ventures, partnerships, and product offerings, we believe we are creating sustainable quality growth for the company.
Through our dedication to our clients' missions, and a commitment to evolving our business to address their needs, we have longstanding relationships with our clients, some more than 75 years. We support critical missions for a diverse base of federal government clients, including nearly all of the U.S. government's cabinet-level departments, as well as increasingly for top-tier commercial and international clients. We support our federal government clients by helping them tackle their most complex and pressing challenges such as protecting soldiers in combat and supporting their families, advancing cyber capabilities, keeping our national infrastructure secure, enabling and enhancing digital services, transforming the healthcare system, and improving governmental efficiency to achieve better outcomes. We serve commercial clients across industries including financial services, health and life sciences, energy, and transportation to solve the hardest and most consequential challenges, including through our cybersecurity products and services. Our international clients are primarily in the Middle East, and we have a growing presence in Southeast Asia.
 History and Corporate Structure
We were founded in 1914 by Edwin Booz, one of the pioneers of management consulting. In 1940, we began serving the U.S. government by advising the Secretary of the Navy in preparation for World War II. As the needs of our clients have grown more complex, we have expanded beyond our management consulting foundation to develop deep expertise in the fields of analytics, digital solutions, engineering and cyber.
We are organized and operate as a corporation, but sometimes use the term “partner” to refer to our Chief Executive Officer and our Senior and Executive Vice Presidents. The use of the term “partner” reflects our collaborative culture, and is not meant to imply that we operate our company as, or have any intention to create a legal entity that is, a partnership. 
Booz Allen Holding was incorporated in Delaware in May 2008 to serve as the top-level holding company for the consolidated Booz Allen Hamilton U.S. government consulting business. On July 31, 2008, Booz Allen Hamilton completed the separation of its U.S. government consulting business from its legacy commercial and international consulting business, the spin-off of the commercial and international business, and the sale of 100% of its outstanding common stock to Booz Allen Holding, or the Carlyle Acquisition, which was majority owned by The Carlyle Group and certain of its affiliated investment funds, or Carlyle. Our company is a corporation that is the successor to the U.S. government consulting business of Booz Allen Hamilton following the separation. Between 2013 and 2016, we registered the offering and sale of common stock by Carlyle, and on December 6, 2016, Carlyle disposed of its remaining shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock in a registered secondary offering. 
Our Institution and Operating Model 
We operate as a single profit/loss center with a single bonus pool for partners, vice presidents, principals, and senior associates. Our operating model encourages collaboration allowing us to bring a mix of the best talent to every client engagement. Our partnership-style culture provides the operational flexibility necessary to quickly mobilize people and capabilities to react to market changes faster than our competitors. As a result, we can go to market as a whole firm rather than as a collection of individual competing business units or profit centers. Our operating model also encourages and enables continuous investment in the right markets, capabilities, and talent to position the company for further growth by anticipating what government and commercial clients will need next.
Across all markets, we address our clients’ complex and evolving needs by deploying multifaceted teams with a combination of deep mission understanding, market-leading functional capabilities, consulting talent, and true technical and engineering expertise. These client-facing teams, which are fundamental to our differentiated value proposition, better position us to create market-relevant growth strategies and plan for and meet current, future, and prospective market needs. They also

help us identify and deliver against diverse client needs in a more agile manner. Our significant win rates during fiscal 2018 on new and re-competed contracts of 63% and 87%, respectively, as compared to 62% and 90%, respectively, in fiscal 2017 demonstrate the strength of this approach.
Our People
Our ability to deliver lasting value and results to our clients has always been, and continues to be, a product of the strong character, expertise and tremendous passion of our people. Our approximately 24,600 employees work to solve hard problems by making our clients' missions their own, combining decades of consulting and domain expertise with functional expertise in areas such as analytics, digital solutions, engineering, and cyber. Our talented people are supported by a culture of innovation and inclusion.
Our people at a glance:

• | 77 partners


• | Nearly 28% are veterans, including 17 partners


• | Approximately 84% hold bachelor's degrees; approximately 40% hold master's degrees; and approximately 3% hold doctoral degrees


• | Approximately 69% hold security clearances

We attract and retain the best people by providing them with opportunities to grow, build skills, and be appreciated for their contributions as they work on our clients' toughest challenges. This value proposition creates a virtuous circle in which our employees know they are making a difference while growing their careers, which furthers their commitment to Booz Allen and makes them ambassadors for future talent. Booz Allen has always recognized the importance of our people and culture, and we continue to build on that strong legacy as we support our employees to meet their full potential.
We also foster the spirit of innovation through events, partnerships, programs, and tools that facilitate collaboration to tackle a common challenge or pitch new products and capabilities. It is the diversity of our employees that fuels this innovation enhancing the way we work by bringing a wealth of experiences and expertise to any challenge. We celebrate difference in all forms, building an environment of inclusion regardless of ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age or disability.
The importance we place on our people continues to receive external recognition. For the eighth consecutive year, Booz Allen has received a perfect score on the Corporate Equality Index (CEI), a national benchmarking survey on corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality administered by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. In addition, for the third consecutive year, Booz Allen received a perfect score on the 2017 Disability Equality Index (DEI), and has been named a DEI "Best Place to Work." Vault.com ranked us as #1 in public sector consulting. Fortune named the company as one of the World's Most Admired Companies and Forbes selected us as one of the Top Employers for Veterans and one of the best Management Consulting Firms for 2017. We have also been honored with industry awards that showcase our employer brand, including "One of the 9 Best Management Consulting Firms" by Business Insider, a "Top Company for People with Disabilities" by Diversity Inc, "Best for Vets" by Military Times, a "Top Company of 2017" by LinkedIn, "Working Mother Top 100", "#7 Best Places to Work in IT" by Computer World and the Alliance for Workplace Excellence Award.
Beyond their client work, our people and our Company demonstrate passionate service in their commitment to our country, military, and communities. Our social impact strategy connects people, organizations, and communities with transformational innovation and technological solutions that power human potential and wider social impact in a spirit of passionate service. For example, we support a variety of organizations assisting veterans and military families, including supporting training in cyber and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers, and providing data analytics and other tech solutions in support of operations. Our partners include USO of Metropolitan Washington-Baltimore, Hiring Our Heroes, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, Blue Star Families and the Elizabeth Dole Foundation. 
In the past year, we issued 379 volunteer service grants to 306 nonprofit groups for which employees volunteered more than 40 hours. Employees recorded more than 65,000 total hours of service during the year and donated generously to the American Red Cross National Disaster Relief Fund and other organizations responding to the recent and large-scale natural and man-made disasters across the United States. More broadly, we have taken a leadership role in eliminating the stigma around mental health and building more appreciation and awareness of emotional fitness in the corporate world as a partner to the nonprofit Give an Hour.
Purpose and Values. As one of the first organizations in the United States to adopt a formal code of business ethics, we have always believed that doing what's right and holding ourselves and others accountable is the only way to do business. Our people exemplify our purpose to "empower people to change the world" and live our values:
•Ferocious Integrity: Do right; hold ourselves accountable

•Unflinching Courage: Speak truth to power; maintain convictions; bring bold thinking
•Passionate Service: Embrace the mission; build community through generosity; make meaningful connections; listen and act with empathy
•Collective Ingenuity: Find the biggest problem and solve it; be resourceful and creative; seek to make the biggest difference; harness the power of diversity; be devoted to the team
•Champion's Heart: Crave being the best; bring joy to the pursuit; learn from failure; compete with passion
Service Offerings
We offer five service offerings that drive our capacity to meet market demand. We provide a range of technological capabilities that have had an enduring impact for our clients, our people, and the communities where we live and work.
Our service offerings:

• | Consulting focuses on the talent and expertise needed to solve client problems and develop mission-oriented solutions for specific domains, business strategies, human capital, and operations through new and innovative approaches. We help clients boost organizational performance, deploy new technologies in smart ways, and change and streamline processes to achieve better outcomes.


• | Analytics focuses on delivering transformational solutions in the areas of decision analytics (including operations research and cost estimation), automation, and data science (including predictive modeling and machine learning) as well as new or emerging areas such as deep learning and artificial intelligence.

Innovation
With our solutions business, we are developing transformative solutions that build lasting value for our clients. We are advancing and creating the infrastructure and mechanics for new and disruptive business models by enabling a vibrant innovation culture, bringing a solutions mindset to our marketplace and sales force and building the company's presence and brand in the external innovation ecosystem. As a gateway to driving innovation, the solutions business combines market-prioritized needs with the company's capabilities and products. The solutions business enhances future revenue opportunities and accelerates solutions to clients, monetizes the firm's intellectual property, and creates differentiated business models and sales channels to drive greater value for our clients.
In addition, we are an essential partner in regional innovation communities all over the country. Through our innovation ecosystem, we are focused on solution co-creation and technology scouting, and are physically co-locating, co-creating, mentoring, incubating, contributing, and investing with organizations in Washington, D.C.; Boston, Massachusetts; Austin, Texas; San Francisco, California; and from Seattle, Washington to San Diego, California (the corridor of venture capitalists and digital powerhouses), with new hubs in Herndon, Virginia, Laurel, Maryland, and Charleston, South Carolina. We harness next-
5

generation technologies being created in academic, startup, and big technology firms to imagine and incubate new offerings, solutions, and growth for the company.
In addition to our service offerings, Booz Allen is driving focused innovation in areas expected to create integrated capabilities, drive next generation expertise, and develop business over the long term. These innovation areas include:

• | Machine Intelligence applies and scales the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to fundamentally transform how our clients perform their missions and run their organizations in a future where people and increasingly intelligent machines collaborate to solve our hardest problems. We are continuing to develop new capabilities in exciting areas, such as quantum computing and deep learning, to create long-term differentiation and value.


• | Directed Energy technologies use high-energy lasers or high-powered microwaves to efficiently disrupt or damage targets with non-kinetic, speed-of-light engagement. Through our Directed Energy business, we can help clients as a technology maturation agent, integrator, and solutions provider.

Our Long-Term Growth Strategy
Vision 2020 is a comprehensive strategy to transform Booz Allen and create sustainable quality growth for the company. Fiscal 2018 was the fifth year of implementing the strategy, but its design reaches back to before the government market began to contract in 2011and 2012. We anticipated the market downturn and set in place a strategy that would allow us to emerge in a strong position vis-à-vis our competitors. Under Vision 2020, we are:

• | Moving closer to the center of our clients' core missions


• | Increasing the technical content of our work


• | Attracting and retaining superior talent in diverse areas of expertise


• | Leveraging innovation to deliver complex, differentiated, end-to-end solutions


• | Creating a broad network of external partners and alliances


• | Expanding into the commercial and international markets

The success of our strategy can be seen in:

• | Backlog growth, which achieved record levels during fiscal 2018


• | Headcount growth and a corresponding shift in our talent portfolio to more technical expertise in disciplines such as systems development, cyber, and analytics


• | Continued strong performance in the global commercial market


• | Execution against our capability focused acquisition strategy, most recently through the acquisition of technology firm, Morphick, Inc., which closed in October 2017, to expand Booz Allen's managed security portfolio and strengthen the firm's capability to help clients counter advanced cyber threats.

We have won highly technical, mission-critical work across our federal government business because we bring differentiated offerings that meet our clients’ toughest challenges. To propel our success against our Vision 2020 long-term strategy, we have implemented initiatives to drive innovation deeper into our markets, enhancing our ability to collaborate and achieve more for our clients and differentiating Booz Allen in the talent market to enhance our ability to attract and retain the best and the brightest.
These initiatives are ultimately designed to accelerate revenue growth and move Booz Allen further toward our goal of delivering sustainable quality growth.
Our Clients 
Booz Allen is committed to solving our clients' toughest challenges, and we work with a diverse base of public and private sector clients across a number of industries, in the U.S. and internationally. 
Our clients call us to work on their hardest problems, such as delivering effective healthcare, protecting soldiers in combat and their families and keeping our national infrastructure secure. We are investing in markets, capabilities, and talent and are building new business models through strategic ventures, partnerships, and product offerings.

A Large Addressable Market
We believe that the U.S government is the world's largest consumer of management and technology consulting services. The U.S. government's budget for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 was close to $4.0 trillion, excluding authorizations from Overseas Contingency Operations and supplemental funding for the Department of Defense. Of this amount, approximately $1.2 trillion was for discretionary budget authority, including $634 billion for the Department of Defense and intelligence community and $586 billion for civil agencies. Based on data from the Federal Procurement Data System, approximately $508 billion of the U.S. government's fiscal year 2017 discretionary outlays were non-intelligence agency funding-related products and services procured from private contractors. We estimate that $124.4 billion of the spending directed towards private contractors in U.S. government fiscal year 2017 was for management, technology, and engineering services, with $69.6 billion spent by the Department of Defense and $54.8 billion spent by civil agencies. The agencies of the U.S. intelligence community that we serve represent an additional market. These numbers also exclude a large addressable market for our services and capabilities in the global commercial markets where we have a modest but growing footprint. 
During Booz Allen's fiscal 2018:

• | We derived 97% of our revenue from contracts where the end client was an agency or department of the U.S. government.


• | We delivered services under 4,997 contracts and task orders.


• | We derived 91% of our revenue in fiscal 2018 from engagements for which we acted as the prime contractor.


• | The single largest entity that we served in fiscal 2018 was the Navy Marine Corps, which represented approximately 13% of our revenue in that period.

Defense and Intelligence Clients
We count among our many defense and intelligence clients all four branches of the U.S. military, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff and members of the intelligence community.
We help our military services take on new missions, tackle acquisition and budgeting challenges, and address the medical needs of soldiers in combat. We also help our defense and intelligence clients adopt innovative technologies, bridging the gap they face between rising mission responsibilities and declining mission funding with our heritage and expertise in consulting. In addition, we bring tools, techniques, and expertise to challenges and apply them in innovative ways.
The men and women we hire have served their country and have the experience and determination to help our defense clients keep our nation safe. Our experts in strategy development, acquisition, and operations help commanders and their staffs in the field share mission-critical information and make crucial battlefield decisions.
Revenue generated from defense clients was $2.83 billion, or approximately 45.9% of our revenue in fiscal 2018 as compared to $2.70 billion, or approximately 46.6% of our revenue in fiscal 2017. Our key defense clients include the Army, Navy/Marine Corps, Air Force, and Joint Combatant Commands. Revenue generated from defense clients also includes foreign military sales to non-U.S. government clients.

Revenue generated from intelligence clients was $1.49 billion, or approximately 24.2% of our revenue in fiscal 2018 as compared to $1.34 billion, or approximately 23.1% of our revenue in fiscal 2017. Our key intelligence clients include U.S. intelligence agencies, such as the National Security Agency, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and National Reconnaissance Office; and military intelligence agencies, such as the Defense Intelligence Agency, Service Intelligence Centers, and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance units.
Civil Clients
Whether ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of citizens, or boosting national competitiveness, we work with leaders in civil government to support their public service missions. We excel at tackling the most complex challenges from reforming financial regulatory oversight and evolving our healthcare system to improving information sharing among law enforcement organizations and supporting green building initiatives. 
Our work spans the full breadth of civil government, including energy and the environment, financial services, health, homeland security, law enforcement, transportation, grants, international development and diplomacy, and benefits and entitlements.
We work with leaders so they make better decisions and foster better user experiences both inside and outside of their organizations.
Revenue generated from civil government was $1.65 billion, or approximately 26.7% of our revenue in fiscal 2018 as compared to $1.61 billion, or approximately 27.7% of our revenue in fiscal 2017. Our major civil government clients include the Departments of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Treasury and Justice.
Global Commercial Clients
We work alongside public and private sector leaders of the world's most prestigious organizations to help shape and execute their critical agendas.
Following the 2011 expiration of our non-competition agreement with our spun-off commercial business, we re-entered the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Southeast Asia (SEA) markets. We originally established our international offices located in MENA more than six decades ago and our offices in SEA more than three decades ago. Since re-entering these markets, our strategy and technology consultants have empowered our clients in these regions with the knowledge and experience they need to build their own local resources and capabilities.
Revenue generated from global commercial clients was $197.0 million, or approximately 3.2% of our revenue in fiscal 2018 as compared to $152.1 million, or approximately 2.6% of our revenue in fiscal 2017. Global commercial clients are comprised of U.S. commercial and international clients. We serve commercial clients in a variety of industries including financial services, health and life sciences, energy and transportation. Our international clients include non-U.S. governments and commercial entities in the MENA region and select Asian markets.
Contracts
Booz Allen's approach has long been to ensure that we have prime or subcontractor positions on a wide range of contracts that allow clients maximum opportunity to access our services. Our diverse contract base provides stability to our business. This diversity shows that more than 75% of our revenue for fiscal 2018 was derived from 3,956 active task orders under IDIQ contract vehicles. Our top IDIQ contract vehicle represented approximately 6.2% of our revenue in our fiscal 2018. Our largest task order under an IDIQ contract vehicle accounted for approximately 2.7% of our revenue in our fiscal 2018. Our largest definite contract represented approximately 2.2% of our revenue in our fiscal 2018. 
The U.S. government procures services through two predominant contracting methods: indefinite contract vehicles and definite contracts. Each of these is described below:

• | Indefinite contract vehicles provide for the issuance by the client of orders for services or products under the terms of the contract. Indefinite contracts are often referred to as contract vehicles or ordering contracts. IDIQ contracts may be awarded to one contractor (single award) or several contractors (multiple award). Under a multiple award IDIQ contract, there is no guarantee of work as contract holders must compete for individual work orders. IDIQ contracts will often include pre-established labor categories and rates, and the ordering process is streamlined (usually taking less than a month from recognition of a need to an established order with a contractor). IDIQ contracts often have multiyear terms and unfunded ceiling amounts, thereby enabling but not committing the U.S. government to purchase substantial amounts of products and services from one or more contractors in a streamlined procurement process.


• | Definite contracts call for the performance of specified services or the delivery of specified products. The U.S. government procures services and solutions through single award, definite contracts that specify the scope of services that will be delivered and identify the contractor that will provide the specified services. When an agency recognizes a need for services or products, it develops an acquisition plan, which details how it will procure those

8

services or products. During the acquisition process, the agency may release a request for information to determine if qualified bidders exist, a draft request for a proposal to allow the industry to comment on the scope of work and acquisition strategy, and finally a formal request for a proposal. Following the evaluation of submitted proposals, the agency will award the contract to the winning bidder.
Listed below are our top IDIQ contracts for fiscal 2018 and the number of active task orders under these contracts as of March 31, 2018.

(1) Expiration date applies to the IDIQ vehicle. Task orders awarded under the IDIQ can run past the expiration of the IDIQ itself.
Under their Category Management initiative, the General Services Administration (“GSA”) has undertaken an effort to improve its professional service schedule offerings. As a result of this initiative, GSA consolidated multiple contract vehicles under the schedule program. The result for Booz Allen has been the consolidation of the scope of six schedules into one professional services schedule contract. The GSA Schedule contracts to be consolidated under the new professional services schedule are: Advertising and Integrated Marketing Solutions (AIMS), Environmental Services (ES), Financial and Business Services (FABS), Logistics Worldwide (LOGWORLD), Mission Oriented Business Integrated Services (MOBIS), and Professional Engineering Services (PES).
Booz Allen’s migration request was accepted in October of 2015 and, as a result, our individual schedules included in the GSA’s consolidation will remain in place through the end of the current option period of each individual contract to prevent the interruption of services. The revenue generated under these individual schedules will begin to decrease during this transition period. We anticipate that the decrease in revenue on the individual schedules will be offset by growth under the new professional service schedule. We anticipate this transition will have negligible impact on future revenues.
Listed below for each specified revenue band is the number of, revenue derived from, and average duration of our task orders as of March 31, 2018. The table includes revenue earned during fiscal 2018 under all task orders that were active during fiscal 2018 under these IDIQ contracts and the number of active task orders on which this revenue was earned. Average duration reflected in the table below is calculated based on the inception date of the task order, which may be prior to the beginning of fiscal 2018, and the completion date which may have been prior or subsequent to March 31, 2018. As a result, the actual average remaining duration for task orders included in this table may be less than the average duration shown in the table, and task orders included in the table may have been complete on March 31, 2018.

Backlog
We define backlog to include the following three components:

• | Funded Backlog. Funded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts.


• | Unfunded Backlog. Unfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders (including optional orders) for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized.


• | Priced Options. Priced contract options represent 100% of the revenue value of all future contract option periods under existing contracts that may be exercised at our clients’ option and for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized.

Backlog does not include any task orders under IDIQ contracts except to the extent that task orders have been awarded to us under those contracts.
The following table summarizes the value of our contract backlog as of the respective dates presented:

Competition
The government services market is highly fragmented and competition within the government professional services industry has intensified due to market pressure. In addition to professional service companies like ours that focus principally on the provision of services to the U.S. government, other companies active in our markets include large defense contractors; diversified consulting, technology, and outsourcing service providers; and small businesses. 
Changing government policies and market dynamics are impacting the competitive landscape. In the past, the government's focus on organizational conflicts of interest have driven divestitures, which have changed the competitive landscape. More recently, there has been increasing pressure from government clients to utilize small businesses, due in large part to a push by both past and present administrations to bolster the economy by helping small business owners. Finally, due to the foregoing factors and the drive in our markets to quickly build competencies in growth areas and achieve economies of scale, we believe that consolidation activity among market participants will continue.
In the course of doing business, we compete and collaborate with companies of all types and sizes. We strive to maintain positive and productive relationships with these organizations. Some of them hire us as a subcontractor, and we hire some of them to work with us as our subcontractors. Our major competitors include: (1) contractors focused principally on the provision of services to the U.S. government, (2) large defense contractors that provide both products and services to the U.S. government, and (3) diversified service providers. We compete based on our technical expertise and client knowledge, our ability to successfully recruit appropriately skilled and experienced talent, our ability to deliver cost-effective multifaceted services in a timely manner, our reputation and relationship with our clients, our past performance, security clearances, and the size and scale of our company. In addition, to maintain our competitive position, we routinely review our operating structure, capabilities, and strategy to determine whether we are effectively meeting the needs of existing clients, effectively responding to developments in our markets, and successfully building a platform intended to provide the foundation for the future growth of our business.
Patents and Proprietary Information
Our management and technology consulting services business utilizes a variety of proprietary rights in delivering products and services to our clients. We claim a proprietary interest in certain of our service offerings, products, software tools, methodologies, and know-how and also have certain licenses to third-party intellectual property that may be significant to our business. While we have several patents issued in the United States and patents pending both in the United States and in certain foreign countries, we do not consider our overall business to be materially dependent on the protection of such patents. In addition, we have a number of trade secrets that contribute to our success and competitive position, and we endeavor to protect this proprietary information. While protecting trade secrets and proprietary information is important, we are not materially dependent on any specific trade secret or group of trade secrets.
We rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements, as well as copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary information. We also enter into proprietary information and intellectual property agreements with employees, which require them to disclose any inventions created during employment, to convey such rights to inventions to us, and to restrict any disclosure of proprietary information. We have a variety of proprietary marks registered in the United States and certain foreign countries, including "Booz Allen Hamilton." Generally, registered trademarks have perpetual life, provided that they are renewed on a timely basis and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We have registered trademarks related to our name and logo in the United States, with the earliest renewal in March 2020, while the earliest renewal for our trademarks outside of the United States is October 2019. 
For our work under U.S. government funded contracts and subcontracts, the U.S. government obtains certain rights to data, software, and related information developed under such contracts or subcontracts. These rights generally allow the U.S. government to disclose such data, software, and related information to third parties, which may include our competitors in some instances. In the case of our work as a subcontractor, our prime contractor may also have certain rights to data, information, and products we develop under the subcontract.
Booz Allen Hamilton and other trademarks or service marks of Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. appearing in this Annual Report are the trademarks or registered trademarks of Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. Trade names, trademarks, and service marks of other companies appearing in this Annual Report are the property of their respective owners.

Regulation
As a contractor to the U.S. government, as well as state and local governments, we are heavily regulated in most fields in which we operate. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, and, when working with these and other entities, we must comply with and are affected by unique laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of public government contracts. Some significant laws and regulations that affect us include:

• | the Federal Acquisition Regulation (the "FAR"), and agency regulations supplemental to the FAR, which regulate the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. For example, FAR 52.203-13 requires contractors to establish a Code of Business Ethics and Conduct, implement a comprehensive internal control system, and report to the government when the contractor has credible evidence that a principal, employee, agent, or subcontractor, in connection with a government contract, has violated certain federal criminal laws, violated the civil False Claims Act, or has received a significant overpayment;


• | the False Claims Act, which imposes civil and criminal liability for violations, including substantial monetary penalties, for, among other things, presenting false or fraudulent claims for payments or approval;


• | the False Statements Act, which imposes civil and criminal liability for making false statements to the U.S. government;


• | the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with the negotiation of a contract, modification, or task order;


• | the Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates access to competitor bid and proposal information and certain internal government procurement sensitive information, and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government procurement officials;


• | laws and regulations restricting the ability of a contractor to provide gifts or gratuities to employees of the U.S. government;


• | post-government employment laws and regulations, which restrict the ability of a contractor to recruit and hire current employees of the U.S. government and deploy former employees of the U.S. government;


• | laws, regulations, and executive orders restricting the handling, use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes or determined to be “controlled unclassified information” or “for official use only” and the export of certain products, services, and technical data, including requirements regarding any applicable licensing of our employees involved in such work;


• | laws, regulations, and executive orders, including the Anti-Kickback Act, regulating the handling, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information in the course of performing a U.S. government contract;


• | international trade compliance laws, regulations and executive orders that prohibit business with certain sanctioned entities and require authorization for certain exports or imports in order to protect national security and global stability;


• | laws, regulations, and executive orders governing organizational conflicts of interest that may restrict our ability to compete for certain U.S. government contracts because of the work that we currently perform for the U.S. government or may require that we take measures such as firewalling off certain employees or restricting their future work activities due to the current work that they perform under a U.S. government contract;


• | laws, regulations and executive orders that impose requirements on us to ensure compliance with requirements and protect the government from risks related to our supply chain;


• | laws, regulations and mandatory contract provisions providing protections to employees or subcontractors seeking to report alleged fraud, waste, and abuse related to a government contract;


• | the Contractor Business Systems rule, which authorizes Department of Defense agencies to withhold a portion of our payments if we are determined to have a significant deficiency in our accounting, cost estimating, purchasing, earned value management, material management and accounting, and/or property management system; and


• | the Cost Accounting Standards and Cost Principles, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. government contracts and require consistency of accounting practices over time.

Given the magnitude of our revenue derived from contracts with the Department of Defense, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or DCAA, is our cognizant government audit agency. The DCAA audits the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies including, among other areas, compensation. The Defense Contract Management Agency, or DCMA, our cognizant government contract management agency, may determine that a portion of our employee compensation is unallowable based on 
12

the findings and recommendations in the DCAA's audits. In addition, the DCMA directly reviews the adequacy of certain other business systems, such as our purchasing system. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risk Related to Our Industry — Our contracts, performance, and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits, reviews, investigations, and cost adjustments by the U.S. government, which could reduce our revenue, disrupt our business, or otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations.” We are also subject to audit by Inspectors General of other U.S. government agencies.
The U.S. government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time. In order to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, all of our employees are required to attend ethics training at least annually, as well as other compliance training relevant to their position. Internationally, we are subject to special U.S. government laws and regulations (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), local government regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investments, exchange controls, and repatriation of earnings, as well as varying currency, political, and economic risks.
U.S. government contracts are, by their terms, subject to termination by the U.S. government either for its convenience or default by the contractor. In addition, U.S. government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a September 30 fiscal year basis, even though contract performance may take many years. As is common in the industry, our company is subject to business risks, including changes in governmental appropriations, national defense policies, service modernization plans, and availability of funds. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our company’s business with the U.S. government in the future.
The U.S. government has a broad range of actions that it can instigate in order to enforce its procurement law and policies. These include proposing a contractor, certain of its operations or individual employees for debarment or suspending or debarring a contractor, certain of its operations or individual employees from future government business. In addition to criminal, civil and administrative actions by the U.S. government, under the False Claims Act, an individual alleging fraud related to payments under a U.S. government contract or program may file a qui tam lawsuit on behalf of the government against us; if successful in obtaining a judgment or settlement, the individual filing the suit may receive up to 30% of the amount recovered by the government. 
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations, some of which are highly complex, and our failure to comply could result in fines or civil or criminal penalties or suspension or debarment by the U.S. government that could result in our inability to continue to work on or receive U.S. government contracts, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.”
