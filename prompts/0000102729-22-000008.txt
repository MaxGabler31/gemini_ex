ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
    General
We are a diversified producer of products and services for infrastructure and agriculture markets. Our Infrastructure products and services are delivered through the Engineered Support Structures segment, the Utility Support Structure segment, and the Coatings segment. Our Irrigation products and services are delivered through the Irrigation segment. In 2021, the Company operated and reported its results in the following four reporting segments:
•Engineered Support Structures (ESS);
•Utility Support Structures (Utility); 
•Coatings; and
•Irrigation 
Our ESS segment offers solutions to help make roadways safer, infrastructure smarter, and increases connectivity through the following products: outdoor lighting, traffic control, and roadway safety structures, wireless communication structures and components, and engineered access systems. Our Utility segment helps deliver power with products to better harden grids to make infrastructure more resilient by selling structures to support electrical transmission, distribution lines, and substation conversion and storage. Our Irrigation segment produces mechanized irrigation equipment and related services to help deliver water, fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides to agricultural crops that save time, conserve water, energy, and other input costs while also assisting in increasing yields. This segment also develops technology for better precision application including predictive, autonomous crop management. Our Coatings segment provides coatings services for Valmont and other industrial customers, to assist in extending the lifespan of infrastructure. 
Customers and end-users of our products include municipalities and government entities globally, manufacturers of commercial lighting fixtures (OEM), contractors, telecommunications and utility companies, and large farming operations, as well as the general manufacturing sector. In 2021, approximately 34% of our net sales were either sold in markets or produced by our manufacturing plants outside of North America. 
We were founded in 1946, went public in 1968 and our shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker: VMI).
Business Strategy
Our strategy is to pursue growth opportunities that leverage our existing product portfolio, knowledge of our principal end-markets and customers and engineering capability to increase our sales, earnings and cash flow, including:
Increasing the Market Penetration of our Existing Products. Our strategy is to increase our market penetration by differentiating our products from our competitors’ products through superior customer service, engineering proficiency, technological innovation and consistent high quality. Our Irrigation segment experienced sales volume growth in 2021 which we believe was partially due to the continuing importance of our precision agriculture/technology offerings.
Bringing our Existing Products to New Markets. Our strategy is to expand the sales of our existing products into geographic areas where we do not currently serve and where end-users do not currently purchase our type of product. For example, we have expanded our geographic presence in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa for lighting structures. This strategy led to us building manufacturing presences in China and India to expand our offering of pole structures for lighting, utility and wireless communication to these markets. Our Irrigation segment has a long history of developing new emerging markets for mechanized irrigation around the world. In 2020, we secured a $240 million multi-year order for the Egypt market. 
 Developing New Products for Markets that We Currently Serve. Our strategy is to grow by developing new products for markets using our comprehensive understanding of end-user requirements and leveraging longstanding relationships with key distributors and end-users. In recent years we developed and sold structures for tramway applications in Europe, spun concrete distribution poles for the Utility markets, and began offering concealment solutions for the wireless communication markets. 
Developing New Products for New Markets or Leveraging Core Competencies to Further Diversify our Business is a path to increase sales. For example, the establishment and growth of our Coatings segment was based on using our expertise in galvanizing to develop what is now a global business segment. The decorative lighting market has different requirements and preferences than our traditional transportation and commercial markets. In 2021, we acquired Prospera Technologies, Ltd., an artificial intelligence technology company focused on machine learning and computer vision in agriculture providing an opportunity to grow recurring revenue through agronomy monitoring software solutions. In 2020, we acquired Solbras®, a provider of solar energy solutions for agriculture and during 2018, we acquired Convert Italia SpA, a provider of engineered single axis solar tracking solutions. These furthered our commitment to renewable energy which we believe will provide us future growth opportunities through the ability to bring power to underserved regions and transform unproductive land into efficient cropland.

    Segments
The Company has four reportable segments based on our management structure. Each segment is global in nature with a manager responsible for segment operational performance and allocation of capital within the segment. 
Our reportable segments are as follows:
Engineered Support Structures: This segment consists of the manufacture and distribution of engineered poles, towers, and components for lighting, transportation, and wireless communication markets, engineered access systems, integrated structure solutions for smart cities, and highway safety products;
Utility Support Structures: This segment consists of the manufacture of engineered steel and concrete structures for utility markets, including transmission, distribution, substation products, and renewable energy generation equipment;
Coatings: This segment consists of galvanizing, CorroCote, anodizing, and powder coating services to preserve and protect metal products; and 
Irrigation: This segment consists of the manufacture of center pivots and linear irrigation equipment for agricultural markets, including parts, services, and tubular products, and advanced technology solutions for water management and precision agriculture.
Information concerning the principal products produced and services rendered, markets, competition and distribution methods for each of our four reportable segments is set forth below.
    Engineered Support Structures Segment (ESS)
Products Produced—We design, engineer, and manufacture steel, aluminum, wood, and composite poles and structures for a wide range of lighting and highway transportation applications. The demand for these products is driven by infrastructure, commercial and residential construction and by consumers’ desire for well-lit streets, highways, parking lots and common areas. Valmont structures help keep these areas safer, provide technologically advanced solutions for smart cities, and support 24-hour convenience. Beyond design, technical, and engineering needs, customers also want products that are visually appealing and meet local aesthetic requirements. In Europe, Valmont is a leader in decorative lighting poles, which provide an attractive yet functional solution for our customers. We are leveraging this expertise to expand our decorative product sales in North America, and the Middle East. 
Valmont traffic and overhead sign structures contribute to the orderly flow of automobile traffic. These poles, which support traffic signals and overhead signs, are engineered to meet customer specifications to ensure the proper function and safety of the structure. Product engineering takes into account factors such as weather (e.g. wind, ice) and the products loaded on the structure (e.g. lighting fixtures, traffic signals, overhead signs) to determine the design of the pole. Valmont has expanded its capabilities in the traffic market with the development of patented vibration mitigation technology which continuously improves the safety of traffic and roadway structures by reducing the effects of wind and fatigue. Our transportation segment also includes highway safety system products that are designed and engineered to enhance roadway safety. These systems include guard rail barriers, wire rope safety barriers, crash attenuation barriers and other products. Additionally, Valmont has expanded into the bridge market with the development of our Con-Struct Bridge system. These steel systems are effective, long lasting, and can be installed quickly to reduce costs and expand the life of the structure. 
We also engineer, manufacture, and distribute a broad range of structures (poles and towers), camouflage concealment solutions, and components serving the wireless communication market supporting expanded 5G customer needs. A wireless communication cell site mainly consists of a steel pole or tower, shelter (enclosure where the radio equipment is located), antennas (devices that receive and transmit data and voice information to and from wireless communication devices) and components (items that are used to mount antennas to a structure and to connect cabling and other parts from the antennas to the shelter). Larger monopole structures are engineered and designed to customer specifications, which include factors such as the number of antennas on the structure and wind and soil conditions. Due to the size of these monopole structures, design is important to ensure each structure meets performance and safety specifications. 
We also produce and distribute access systems that allow people to move safely and effectively in an industrial, infrastructure or commercial facility. Products offered in this product line include floor gratings, handrails, barriers and sunscreens. We also produce a line of engineered products which are used in architectural and decorative applications. Examples of these products are perforated metal sun screens and facades that can be used on building structures to improve shading and aesthetics.  We do not provide any significant installation services on the structures we sell or manufacture. 

Markets—The key markets for our products and solutions are the transportation, construction, and industrial markets. The transportation market includes street and highway lighting, traffic control, and bridges; all of which are supported through both state and federal government spending programs. For example, the U.S. government will fund infrastructure improvement through the newly passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This bill will allocate funding to reinforce the nation’s bridges, increase safety for the travelling public, update airport, ports, and waterways, and improve the highway and roads systems. Many products from our transportation product portfolio will be utilized when making these enhancements including traffic structures, bridge systems, roadway and street lighting, highmast lighting, etc. Matching funding from the various states may be required as a condition of federal funding. Additionally, public and private partnerships have recently emerged as an additional funding source. In the United States, there are approximately 4 million miles of public roadways, with approximately 24% carrying over 80% of the traffic. Accordingly, the need to improve traffic flow through traffic controls and lighting is a priority for many communities. Transportation markets in other areas of the world are also heavily funded by local and national governments. 
The construction market is mostly funded privately and includes lighting for applications such as parking lots, shopping centers, sports stadiums and business parks. This market is driven by macro-economic factors such as general economic growth rates, interest rates and the commercial construction economy. Valmont has many long-standing relationships with OEM (also manufacture light fixtures and equipment) who also serve this market. Industrial markets for access systems are typically driven by infrastructure, industrial and commercial construction spending. Customers include construction firms or installers who participate in these markets, natural gas and mineral exploration companies, resellers such as steel service centers, and end users. 
The market for our communication products is driven by increased demand for wireless communication and data. Customers are wireless network providers and organizations that own cell sites and attach antennas from multiple carriers to the pole or tower structure (build to suit companies). We also sell products to state and federal governments for two-way radio communication, radar, broadcasting and security applications. We believe long-term growth should mainly be driven by increased usage and technologies such as 5G, which demand higher network density. Improved emergency response systems, as part of the U.S. Homeland Security initiatives, creates additional demand. 
All of the products that we manufacture in this segment are parts of government or customer investments in basic infrastructure. The total cost of these investments can be substantial, so access to capital is often important to fund infrastructure needs. Demand can be cyclical in these markets due to overall economic conditions. Additionally, projects can sometimes be delayed due to funding or other issues.
Competition—Our competitive strategy in all of the markets we serve is to provide high value to the customer at the appropriate price. We compete on the basis of product quality, high levels of customer service, timely, complete, and accurate delivery of the product and design capability to provide the best solutions to our customers. There are numerous competitors in our markets, most of which are relatively small companies. Companies compete on the basis of price, product quality, reliable delivery, engineering design, and unique product features. Pricing can be very competitive, especially when demand is weak or when strong local currencies result in increased competition from imported products.
Distribution Methods—Sales and distribution activities are handled through a combination of a direct sales force and commissioned agents. Lighting agents represent Valmont as well as lighting fixture and traffic signal lines and sell other related products. Sales are typically to electrical distributors, who provide the pole, fixtures and other equipment to the end user as a complete package. Commercial lighting, wireless communication products and components, access systems and highway safety sales are normally made through Valmont sales employees, who work on a salary plus incentive, although some sales are made through independent, commissioned sales agents.
    Utility Support Structures Segment (Utility)
Products Produced—We engineer and manufacture steel, pre-stressed concrete, composite, and hybrid structures (concrete base section and steel upper sections). These products are used to support the lines and equipment that carry power for electrical transmission, substation and distribution applications. Transmission refers to moving power from where it is produced to where it is used. Substations transfer high voltage electricity to low voltage transmission. Electrical distribution carries electricity from the substation to the end-user. These innovative structures are offered to address the growing need for grid hardening across the globe, where fires, storms, and floods have recently occurred with increasing regularity. 
Utility structures can be very large, so product design engineering is important to the function and safety of the structure. Our engineering process takes into account weather and loading conditions, such as wind speeds, ice loads and the power lines attached to the structure, in order to arrive at the final design. In Northern Europe, we produce utility structures for offshore and onshore wind energy. We also manufacture complex steel structures such as rotor houses for wind turbines.

Our solar single-axis “tracker” product is an integrated system of steel structures, electric motors, and electronic controllers. Trackers move solar panels throughout the day to maintain an optimal orientation to the sun, which materially increases their energy production. Solar energy projects utilizing trackers generate approximately 20% more energy compared to traditional fixed tilt ground-mounted systems, according to Wood Mackenzie. Our trackers utilize a simple, modular design allowing ease of installation and low operational maintenance. Further, the flexibility of our trackers’ design allows for improved site utilization, which is especially valuable to our customers considering that solar projects are being constructed on increasingly challenging sites today. We sell our products to engineering, procurement and construction firms (“EPCs”) that build solar energy projects as well as solar developers, independent power producers, and utilities. 
Markets—Our sales in this segment are mainly in North America, where the key drivers in the utility business are significant upgrades in the electrical grid to support enhanced reliability standards, policy changes encouraging more generation from renewable energy sources, interconnection of regional grids to share more efficient generation to the benefit of the consumer and increased electrical consumption which has outpaced the transmission investment in the past decades. According to the Edison Electric Institute, the electrical transmission grid in the U.S. requires significant investment in the coming years to respond to the compelling industry drivers and lack of investment prior to 2008. In international markets, electrical consumption is expected to increase. This will require substantial investment in new electricity generation capacity and growth in transmission grid development. We expect these factors to result in increased demand for electrical utility structures to transport electricity from source to user, as is used in the U.S. markets today. As utilities increase development of large-scale solar power and micro-grid applications, single axis tracker solutions will be an essential tool for achieving higher energy production. Sales of complex steel structures, wind turbine towers, rotor houses, and utility transmission structures mainly occur within Europe. Approximately 35% of all ground-mounted solar energy projects constructed globally during 2019 utilized trackers according to Wood Mackenzie. Our solar tracker products are used in some of the largest solar projects in the world with over a decade of track record, which is unique in the single-axis solar tracker industry.
Competition—Our competitive strategy in this segment is to provide high value solutions to the customer at the appropriate price. We compete on the basis of product quality, engineering expertise, high levels of customer service, and reliable and timely delivery of the product. There are a number of competitors in North America, but there are many competitors in international markets. Companies compete on the basis of price, quality and service. Utility sales are often made through a competitive bid process, whereby the lowest bidder is awarded the contract, provided the competitor meets all other qualifying criteria. In weak markets, price is a more important criteria in the bid process. We also sell on a preferred-provider basis to certain large utility customers. These contractual arrangements often last between 3 and 5 years and are frequently renewed. For offshore and other complex steel structures, we compete on price based on our ability to co-engineer and design solutions with customers. We are one of a limited number of competitors that can execute advanced order production of complex steel constructions that require a high degree of engineering and complex manufacturing customization. 
Distribution Methods—Products are normally sold directly to electrical utilities or energy providers with some sales sold through commissioned sales agents.
    Coatings Segment (Coatings)
Services Rendered—We add finishes to metals that inhibit corrosion, extend service lives and enhance the aesthetics of a wide range of materials and products. We take unfinished products from our customers and return them with a galvanized, anodized or painted finish. Hot-dip galvanizing is a process that protects and prolongs the life of steel with a zinc coating that is bonded to the product surface to inhibit rust and corrosion. CorroCote adds a protection to steel for those products that are anchored below ground against the corrosive effects of soil and underground moisture. Anodizing is a process applied to aluminum that oxidizes the surface of the aluminum in a controlled manner, which protects the aluminum from corrosion and allows the material to be dyed a variety of colors. We also paint products using powder coating for a number of industries and markets.
Markets—Markets for our products are varied and our profitability is not substantially dependent on any one industry or external customer. However, a meaningful percentage of demand is internal, driven by Valmont's other segments. Demand for coatings services generally follows the local industrial economies. Galvanizing is used in a wide variety of 
industrial applications where corrosion protection of steel is desired. While markets are varied, our markets for anodized or painted products are more directly dependent on consumer markets than industrial markets.
Competition—The Coatings markets traditionally have been very fragmented, with a large number of competitors. Most of these competitors are relatively small, privately held companies who compete on the basis of price and personal relationships with their customers. As a result of ongoing industry consolidation, there are also several (public and private) multi-facility competitors. Our strategy is to compete on the basis of quality of the coating finish and timely delivery of the coated product to the customer. We also use the production capacity at our network of plants to ensure that the customer receives quality, timely service.
Distribution Methods—Due to freight costs, a galvanizing location has an effective service area of an approximate 300 to 500 mile radius. While we believe that we are globally one of the largest custom galvanizers, our sales are a small percentage of the total market. Sales and customer service are provided directly to the user by a direct sales force, generally assigned to each specific location.
    Irrigation Segment (Irrigation)
Products Produced—We manufacture and distribute mechanical irrigation equipment and related service parts under the “Valley” brand name. A Valley irrigation machine is powered by electricity (via solar, grid, or diesel generator) and propels itself over a farm field and applies water and chemicals to crops. Water and, in some instances, chemicals are applied through sprinklers attached to a pipeline that is supported by a series of towers, each of which is propelled via a drive train and tires. A standard mechanized irrigation machine (also known as a “center pivot”) rotates in a circle, although we also manufacture and distribute center pivot extensions that can irrigate corners of square and rectangular farm fields as well as conform to irregular field boundaries (referred to as a “corner” machine). Our irrigation machines can also irrigate fields by moving up and down the field as opposed to rotating in a circle (referred to as a “linear” machine). Irrigation machines can be configured to irrigate fields in size from 4 acres to over 500 acres, with a standard size in the U.S. configured for a 160-acre tract of ground. The irrigation machine used in international markets is substantially the same as the one produced for the North American market. We also manufacture tubular products for industrial customers primarily in the agriculture industry as well as in the transportation and other industries.
Our remote management capabilities allow control of pivots and a variety of other farm equipment on any web-connected device and our suite of advanced technology solutions offers capabilities to assist in reducing water and energy use. Our crop anomaly detection can alert growers of pivot-related water issues with artificial intelligence and machine learning (in select markets) to help farmers determine where and how much to irrigate. During fiscal 2021, we purchased Prospera Technologies Ltd, a leading global artificial intelligence and machine learning provider of advanced agronomy monitoring solutions. Irrigation net sales in 2021, 2020, and 2019 included technology sales of $97.9 million, $67.1 million, and $56.7 million, respectively. We also sell solar energy solutions for agriculture primarily in international markets. 
Other Types of Irrigation — There are other forms of irrigation available to farmers, two of the most prevalent being flood irrigation and drip irrigation. In flood irrigation, water is applied through a pipe or canal at the top of the field and allowed to run down the field by gravity. Drip irrigation involves plastic pipe or tape resting on the surface of the field or buried a few inches below ground level, with water being applied gradually. We estimate that center pivot and linear irrigation comprises 50% of the irrigated acreage in North America. International markets use predominantly flood irrigation.    
Markets—Market drivers in North America and international markets are essentially the same. Since the purchase of an irrigation machine is a capital expenditure, the purchase decision is based on the expected return on investment. The benefits a grower may realize through investment in mechanical irrigation include improved yields through better irrigation, cost savings through reduced labor and lower water and energy usage. The purchase decision is also affected by current and expected net farm income, commodity prices, interest rates, the status of government support programs and water regulations in local areas. In many international markets, the relative strength or weakness of local currencies as compared with the U.S. dollar may affect net farm income, since export markets are generally denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, governments are sponsoring irrigation projects for self-sufficiency in food production. 
The demand for mechanized irrigation comes from the following sources:
•    conversion from flood irrigation
•    replacement of existing mechanized irrigation machines
•    converting land that is not irrigated to mechanized irrigation
One of the key drivers in our Irrigation segment worldwide is that the usable water supply is limited. We estimate that:
•    only 2.5% of total worldwide water supply is freshwater
•    of that 2.5%, only 30% of freshwater is available to humans
•    the largest user of that freshwater is agriculture
We believe these factors, along with the trends of a growing worldwide population, improving diets, and governments' efforts to address food security, reflect the need to use water more efficiently while increasing food production to feed this growing population. We believe that mechanized irrigation can improve water application efficiency by 40-90% compared with traditional irrigation methods by applying water uniformly near the root zone and reducing water runoff. Furthermore, reduced water runoff improves water quality in nearby rivers, aquifers and streams, thereby providing environmental benefits in addition to conservation of water.
Competition—In North America, there are a number of entities that provide irrigation products and services to agricultural customers. We believe we are the leader of the four main participants in the mechanized irrigation business. Participants compete for sales on the basis of product innovation and features, product durability and reliability, price, quality and service capabilities of the local dealer. Pricing can become very competitive, especially in periods when market demand is low. In international markets, our competitors are a combination of our major U.S. competitors and privately‑owned local companies. Competitive factors are similar to those in North America, although pricing tends to be a more prevalent competitive strategy in international markets. Since competition in international markets is local, we believe local manufacturing capability is important to competing effectively in international markets and we have that capability in key regions.
Distribution Methods—We market our irrigation machines, technology offerings, and service parts through independent dealers. There are approximately 270 dealer locations in North America, with another approximately 400 dealers serving international markets in over 60 countries. The dealer determines the grower’s requirements, designs the configuration of the machine, installs the machine (including providing ancillary products that deliver water and electrical power to the machine) and provides after‑sales service. Our dealer network is supported and trained by our technical and sales teams. Our international dealers are supported through our regional headquarters in South America, South Africa, Western Europe, Australia, China and the United Arab Emirates as well as the home office in Valley, Nebraska.
General
Certain information generally applicable to each of our four reportable segments is set forth below.
Suppliers and Availability of Raw Materials.
Hot rolled steel coil and plate, zinc and other carbon steel products are the primary raw materials utilized in the manufacture of finished products for all segments. We purchase these essential items from steel mills, steel service centers, and zinc producers and these materials are usually readily available. While we may experience increased lead times to acquire materials and volatility in our purchase costs, we do not believe that key raw materials would be unavailable for extended periods. We have not experienced extended or wide-spread shortages of steel in the past several years, due to what we believe are strong relationships with some of the major steel producers. In the past several years, we experienced volatility in zinc and natural gas prices, but we did not experience any disruptions to our operations due to availability.
Patents, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions.
We have a number of patents for our manufacturing machinery, poles, highway guardrail, and irrigation designs. We also have a number of registered trademarks. We do not believe the loss of any individual patent or trademark would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Seasonal Factors in Business.
Sales can be somewhat seasonal based upon the agricultural growing season and the infrastructure construction season. Sales of mechanized irrigation equipment to farmers are traditionally higher during the spring and fall and lower in the summer. Sales of infrastructure products are traditionally higher in the summer and fall and lower in the winter.
Customers.
We are not dependent for a material part of any segment’s business upon a single customer or upon very few customers. The loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Backlog.
The backlog of orders for the principal products manufactured and marketed was $1,621.9 million at the end of the 2021 fiscal year and $1,139.1 million at the end of the 2020 fiscal year. An order is reported in our backlog upon receipt of a purchase order from the customer or execution of a sales order contract. We anticipate that most of the 2021 backlog of orders will be filled during fiscal year 2022. At year-end, the segments with backlog were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):

 | 12/25/2021 | | 12/26/2020
Engineered Support Structures | $ | 376.9 | | | $ | 247.1
