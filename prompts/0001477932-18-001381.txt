Item 1. Business.
 
First Foods Group, Inc. (the "Company" or “First Foods” formerly known as Litera Group, Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 1, 2015, as “Litera Group, Inc.”. The Company is a smaller reporting company originally formed to provide products and services within the theater and film production community. On February 16, 2017 the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada in order to change its name from Litera Group, Inc. to First Foods Group, Inc., following approval by its board of directors and shareholders. First Foods is now focused on providing management services and funding options for new foodservice brands and menu concepts. The Company participates in merchant cash advances through its 1st Foods Funding Division. The Company is developing its own new concepts, both through proprietary development and through mergers, acquisitions, and licensing arrangements.
 
On April 21, 2017, the Company entered into a binding term sheet (the “Term Sheet”) with Oded Brenner (“Brenner”). Pursuant to the Term Sheet, the Company and Brenner would form an entity that would own the intellectual property rights to "Blue Stripes-Cacao Shop" (the "IP Entity") for the United States. The Company had 120 days from the date of the Term Sheet to perform due diligence activities and complete the closing. Upon the completion of due diligence, Company Management and the Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interest of the shareholders to forego a US-wide cacao concept. Instead, on August 31, 2017 the Company formed its own wholly owned cacao subsidiary named Holy Cacao, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Holy Cacao”). Holy Cacao will be dedicated to providing recipes, packaging, and branding materials for specialty chocolate to particular states within the US. Third party manufacturers that operate in states where cannabis is legal under state law may use the Company’s recipes to create chocolate infused with cannabis oil and sell the cannabis infused product under the Holy Cacao brand name, if the manufacturer obtains a licensing agreement that would allow for the use of the Company’s Holy Cacao brand name and packaging. However, the Company will not be involved in the manufacture, distribution, or sale of cannabis or any product that contains cannabis. The Company is currently in the process of negotiating specialty chocolate production and packaging contracts with third party providers in anticipation of operating activities to commence in 2018.
 
On June 19, 2017, the Company entered into a binding term sheet (the “TBS Term Sheet”) with The Big Salad Franchise Company, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company ("TBS"). The Company had 60 days from the date of the Term Sheet to perform due diligence activities and complete the closing. Upon the completion of due diligence, Company Management and the Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interest of the shareholders to forego the TBS transaction.
 
On October 25, 2017, the Company entered into a contract with TIER Merchant Advances LLC to participate in the purchase of future receivables from qualified TIER merchants for the purpose of generating near term and long-term revenue for the Company.

OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
We are primarily focused on providing management services and funding options for new foodservice brands and menu concepts. We will also work with both existing restaurant franchise companies and those restaurant companies that are looking to franchise their operations. We will also be attempting to grow our own new concepts, both through proprietary development and through mergers, acquisitions, and licensing arrangements.
TARGET MARKET AND OUR NICHE WITHIN
 
Our target market will be existing and emerging restaurant concepts, whose goal it is to expand via the franchise model. Based upon the experience of our board, we feel that this focus will enable us to operate in a niche that offers potential growth.
COMPETITION, OUR COMPETITIVE STRATEGY AND METHODS OF COMPETITION
 
Other venture capital companies target franchise companies, but not very many concentrate on the restaurant industry and new food service concepts, as we expect to be doing. 
MARKETING, MARKETING OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES
 
The Company markets its services directly to existing and emerging restaurant companies, focusing specifically on brand development, franchising, and capital formation. 
 
Our Marketing Objectives are as follows:
 

· | Establishing and promoting our presence in our selected targeted market; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Creating and maintaining a target list of existing and emerging restaurant companies; and
· | Building a network of food service industry professional relationships and referrals. 

 
To promote and market our services, we have invoked the following strategies:
 

· | Enhanced our online presence via our Company website reflecting our scope of services offered.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Implemented a PR campaign to obtain publicity and increase visibility for our business. 

 
Currently, the Company’s officers and directors promote our services through many channels, including networking at local industry events and Internet sources. We anticipate that, as the Company grows over the next twelve months, pools of expertise will be acquired by recruiting within the food service industry and by using technical and marketing consultants, which will allow qualified individuals to join our management team and Board of Directors.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
The Company has engaged market and branding consultants to research and develop specialty chocolate products and packaging targeted to particular states within the US. 
 
EMPLOYEES
 
The Company’s current employee consists of Mark J. Keeley as the Chief Financial Officer. Harold Kestenbaum is a director consultant serving in the role of interim Chief Executive Officer. Abraham Rosenblum is a director serving in the role of Secretary. These individuals, along with director Hershel Weiss, are responsible for operations, product development, sales and marketing, fund raising, implementation of our general strategy and execution of our business plan.
 
Our future business and operating results depend significantly on the continued contributions and active participation of the aforementioned individuals. These individuals would be difficult or impossible to replace. The loss of these key contributors, or their failure to perform, could materially and adversely affect our Company's operations. While we may obtain Key Man insurance, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the loss incurred in the event these individuals are lost.
 
Currently, our officers receive deferred compensation for their services and, starting in 2018, our directors will receive minimal compensation for their services during the development stage of our business operations. Our officers and directors are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf. We anticipate adding two (2) employees over the next twelve (12) months, one of which will be a Chief Marketing Officer. We do not currently have any benefits, such as health or life insurance, available to our employees.
