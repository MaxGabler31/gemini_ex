History
 
Modine was incorporated under the laws of the State of Wisconsin on June 23, 1916 by its founder, Arthur B. Modine.  Mr. Modine’s “Turbotube” radiators became standard equipment on the famous Ford Motor Company Model T.  When he died at the age of 95, A.B. Modine had personally been granted more than 120 U.S. patents for his heat transfer innovations.  The standard of innovation exemplified by A.B. Modine remains the cornerstone of Modine today.
Terms and Year References
 
When we use the terms “Modine,” “we,” “us,” the “Company,” or “our” in this report, unless the context otherwise requires, we are referring to Modine Manufacturing Company.  Our fiscal year ends on March 31 and, accordingly, all references to a particular year mean the fiscal year ended March 31 of that year, unless indicated otherwise.
Business Strategy and Results
 
Modine pursues market leadership by being a customer-focused, global company delivering exceptional quality, innovation and value. We will grow our core business of thermal management with superior technical solutions in systems, products and services – coupled with a cost competitive structure.
 
During fiscal 2018, we successfully integrated our recently-acquired Luvata Heat Transfer Solutions (“Luvata HTS”) business, which now operates as our Commercial and Industrial Solutions (“CIS”) segment.  This acquisition, which was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, was particularly key in achieving our “Diversify” and “Grow” objectives within our Strengthen, Diversify and Grow (“SDG”) strategic transformation initiative launched in fiscal 2016.  Through this acquisition, we successfully broadened our customer base, increased our presence in non-vehicular markets, and grew our company with CIS segment net sales of $620 million in fiscal 2018.  In addition, we’ve continued strengthening our company through ongoing cost-containment initiatives and the expansion of our low-cost country manufacturing footprint.  Looking ahead, we are confident that our SDG strategy will keep us grounded, thriving, and transforming.

Our top five customers are in three different markets – automotive, commercial vehicle, and off-highway – and our ten largest customers accounted for 48 percent of our fiscal 2018 sales.  In fiscal 2018, 61 percent of our total sales were generated from customers outside of the U.S., with 56 percent of these sales generated by foreign operations and 5 percent generated by exports from the U.S.  In fiscal 2017, 62 percent of our total sales were generated from customers outside of the U.S., with 55 percent of these sales generated by foreign operations and 7 percent generated by exports from the U.S.  In fiscal 2016, 63 percent of our total sales were generated from customers outside of the U.S., with 54 percent of these sales generated by foreign operations and 9 percent generated by exports from the U.S.
 
During fiscal 2018, our consolidated net sales were $2.10 billion, a 40 percent increase from $1.50 billion in fiscal 2017.  This increase was primarily due to $442 million of additional sales from our CIS segment, which we owned for four months of the prior fiscal year, and higher sales in all of our other operating segments.  Our operating income of $92 million in fiscal 2018 represents a $50 million improvement compared with the prior year, primarily due to $18 million of additional operating income contributed by our CIS segment and higher earnings in the Americas, Asia and Building HVAC (“BHVAC”) segments.
 
In continued support of our SDG initiatives and in an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations, we have engaged in various restructuring activities.  As a result, we recorded $16 million of restructuring expenses during fiscal 2018, primarily related to severance expenses and equipment transfer and plant consolidation activities.
 
A key metric by which we measure our performance is return on average capital employed (“ROACE”).  We define ROACE as operating income, plus restructuring expenses, acquisition-related costs and adjustments, impairment charges, and excluding certain other gains or charges, less income tax at a 30 percent rate and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest; divided by the average of debt plus Modine shareholders’ equity.  Our ROACE increased 140 basis points in fiscal 2018 to 8.6 percent compared with 7.2 percent in fiscal 2017.  This increase was primarily due to improved earnings, partially offset by an increase in average capital employed.

ROACE is not a measure derived under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should not be considered as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP.  We believe that ROACE provides investors with helpful information about our performance, our ability to provide an acceptable return on capital, and our ability to fund future growth.  This measure may not be comparable with similar measures presented by other companies.  The following schedule provides a reconciliation of ROACE to net earnings, as presented in accordance with GAAP:

Competitive Position
 
We compete with many manufacturers of heat transfer and HVAC&R products, some of which are divisions of larger companies.  The markets for our products continue to be very dynamic.  Our traditional OEM customers are faced with dramatically increased international competition and have expanded their global manufacturing footprints to compete in local markets.  In addition, consolidation within the supply base and vertical integration has introduced new or restructured competitors to our markets.  Some of these market changes have caused us to experience competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs, lower healthcare costs, and lower tax rates.  As a result, we have expanded and continue to expand our geographic footprint, in part to provide more flexibility to serve our customers around the globe.  Many of our customers also continue to ask us, as well as their other primary suppliers, to provide research and development (“R&D”), design, and validation support for new potential projects.  This combined work effort often results in stronger customer relationships and more partnership opportunities for us.
Business Segments
 
Prior to and including fiscal 2018, we assigned specific operations to segments based principally upon defined markets and geographic locations.  Each operating segment is managed by a vice president and has separate financial results reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.  These results are used by management in evaluating the performance of each business segment and in making decisions on the allocation of resources among our various businesses.  Effective April 1, 2018, we combined our Americas, Europe, and Asia segment operations with the objective of operating as a more global, product-based organization.  As part of this segment combination and our CIS integration activities, we also merged our Americas coils business into the CIS segment and expect to achieve operational improvements and organizational efficiencies as a result.  Beginning for fiscal 2019, we will report financial results for the new Vehicular Thermal Solutions segment, which will include the current Americas, Europe and Asia segments.  Financial information for our operating segments is included in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our Vehicular Businesses
 
Americas, Europe, and Asia Segments
 
The continued globalization of our vehicular customer base requires us to manage our strategic approach, product offerings and the competitive environment on a global basis.  This trend offers significant opportunities for us with our market positioning, including our presence in key vehicular markets (U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Europe, India, China, South Korea, and Japan) and a global organization with the expertise to solve technical challenges.  We are recognized for having strong technical support in all regions, an extensive product portfolio, and the ability to provide global standard designs for our customers. Many vehicular OEMs continue to expect cost reductions from suppliers while requiring a consistent level of quality.  In addition, these OEMs seek new technology solutions at low prices for their thermal management needs.  In general, this creates challenges for us and the entire supply base, but also provides an opportunity for suppliers, like Modine, who develop innovative solutions at a competitive cost.
 
Each of our main vehicular competitors, AKG Group, BorgWarner, Dana Corporation, Denso Corporation, Mahle, Tata Toyo, TitanX, T. Rad Co. Ltd., UFI Filters, Valeo SA, Hanon Systems, and Zhejiang Yinlun Machinery Co. Ltd., have a multi-regional or worldwide presence.  Increasingly, we face heightened competition as these competitors expand their product offerings and manufacturing footprints through expansion into lower-cost countries or lower-cost sourcing initiatives.  In addition, competitors from some lower-cost regions are beginning to expand into new geographical markets.
 
The Americas, Europe, and Asia segments represent our vehicular businesses and serve the automotive, commercial vehicle, and off-highway markets.  The following summarizes the primary markets served by our vehicular segments:
 
Automotive

In addition, our CIS segment includes significant sales generated from a single global technology customer (9 percent of CIS segment sales) with which we are party to confidentiality agreements.  Generally, we supply products to our customers on the basis of individual purchase orders received from them.  When it is in the mutual interest of Modine and our customers, we utilize long-term sales agreements to minimize investment risks and provide the customer with a proven source of competitively-priced products.  These contracts are typically three to five years in duration.
 
Backlog of Orders
 
Our operating segments maintain their own inventories and production schedules.  We believe that our current production capacity is capable of handling the sales volume expected in fiscal 2019 and beyond.
Raw Materials
 
We purchase aluminum, nickel and steel from several domestic and foreign suppliers.  In general, we do not rely on any one supplier for these materials, which are, for the most part, available from numerous sources in quantities required by us.  The supply of copper and brass material is highly concentrated between two global suppliers.  We normally do not experience raw material shortages and believe that our suppliers’ production of these metals will be adequate throughout the next fiscal year.  We typically adjust metals pricing with our raw material and major fabricated component suppliers on a quarterly basis.  When possible, we have made material pass-through arrangements with key customers, which allow us to adjust customer prices, on a prospective basis, based upon increases and decreases in the cost of key raw materials.  When utilized, however, these pass-through arrangements are typically limited to the underlying cost of the material based upon the London Metal Exchange, and do not include related premiums or fabrication costs.  In addition, there can often be a three-month to one-year lag between the time of the material price increase or decrease and the time that we adjust the price with our customer.
Patents
 
We own or license numerous patents related to our products and operations.  These patents and licenses have been obtained over a period of years and expire at various times.  Because we have many product lines, we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. We consider each of our patents, trademarks and licenses to be of value and aggressively defend our rights throughout the world against infringement. We have been granted and/or acquired more than 2,400 patents worldwide over the life of our company.
Research and Development
 
We remain committed to our vision of creating value through technology and innovation.  We focus our engineering and R&D efforts on solutions that meet challenging heat transfer needs of OEMs and other customers within the automotive, powersports, commercial vehicle, construction, agricultural, and commercial, industrial, and building HVAC&R markets.  Our products and systems are often aimed at solving difficult and complex heat transfer challenges requiring advanced thermal management.  Typical market demands are for products and systems that are lighter weight, more compact, more efficient and more durable to meet customer standards as customers work to ensure compliance with increasingly stringent global emissions and energy efficiency requirements.  Our heritage includes a depth and breadth of expertise in thermal management that, combined with our global manufacturing presence, standardized processes, and state-of-the-art technical resources, enables us to rapidly bring customized solutions to our customers.
 
R&D expenditures, including certain application engineering costs for specific customer solutions, totaled $66 million, $64 million, and $61 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  Over the last three years, R&D expenditures have been between 3 and 5 percent of our consolidated net sales.  This level of investment reflects our continued commitment to R&D in an ever-changing marketplace.  To achieve efficiencies and lower development costs, our R&D groups work closely with our customers on special projects and system designs.  Projects include EGR technology, oil coolers, charge air coolers, refrigerant heat exchangers, and battery thermal management systems for the automotive, commercial vehicle, agriculture, construction, and residential and commercial energy storage markets, which enable our customers to meet more stringent emission and energy efficiency standards.  Most of our current R&D activities are focused on internal development in the areas of powertrain cooling, engine cooling, building HVAC, and commercial and industrial thermal management products.  We also collaborate with several industry, university, and government-sponsored research organizations that conduct research and provide data on practical applications in the markets we serve.

Quality Improvement
 
Through our global Quality Management System (“QMS”), which is an integrated part of our management system, the majority of our manufacturing facilities and administrative offices in our Americas, Europe and Asia segments are registered to ISO 9001:2008 or ISO/TS 16949:2009 standards, helping to ensure that our customers receive high quality products and services.  We have begun to transition to ISO 9001:2015 and IATF 16949:2016 standards.  While customer expectations for performance, quality and service continue to rise, our QMS has allowed us to drive improvements in quality performance and has enabled the ongoing delivery of products, service and value that meet or exceed customer expectations.
 
Our global QMS operates within the context of the Modine Operating System (“MOS”), which focuses on well-defined improvement principles and leadership behaviors to engage our teams in facilitating rapid improvements.  We drive sustainable and systematic continuous improvement throughout all operating segments and functional areas of the organization by utilizing the principles, processes and behaviors that are core to these systems.
 
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
 
We are committed to preventing pollution, eliminating waste and reducing environmental risks and we have established specific environmental improvement targets and objectives for the upcoming fiscal year.  The majority of our facilities maintain Environmental Management System (“EMS”) certification to the international ISO14001 standard through independent third-party audits.
 
During fiscal 2018, we launched a global initiative to reduce both our energy and water usage by 5 percent by fiscal 2020.  In support of this initiative, we recently implemented building improvements, including LED lighting, at our recently-acquired Grenada, Mississippi manufacturing facility.  These improvements alone are expected to reduce approximately 2.6 million kilowatt hours of electrical usage per year.
 
Our product portfolio reflects our sense of environmental responsibility.  We continue to develop and refine environmentally-friendly product lines, including oil, fuel, and EGR coolers for gas and diesel applications, light-weight and high-performance powertrain cooling heat exchangers for both combustion and electric vehicle, air cooled refrigerant and liquid heat exchangers used in residential, commercial, and industrial applications, and our advanced cooling system technology.  These products provide increased fuel economies, enable combustion technologies that reduce harmful gas emissions for vehicles, and provide energy efficient solutions for building and stationary applications. Our BHVAC segment offerings, including the EffinityTM, a condensing gas-fired unit heater with industry-leading efficiencies; the AtherionTM Commercial Packaged Ventilation System; the Airedale SchoolMate® with a water source heat pump; and the Airedale Chiller product line-up, ecodesign compliant with European standards.  These products are helping commercial, industrial and residential users achieve high energy efficiencies and reduce utility costs.
 
Obligations for remedial activities may arise at our facilities due to past practices, or as a result of a property purchase or sale.  These expenditures most often relate to sites where past operations followed practices that were considered acceptable under then-existing regulations, but now require investigative and/or remedial work to ensure appropriate environmental protection or where we are a successor to the obligations of prior owners and current laws and regulations require investigative and/or remedial work to ensure sufficient environmental compliance.  Environmental liabilities for investigative work and remediation at sites in the U.S. and abroad totaled $17 million at March 31, 2018.
 
We have consistently out-performed the private-industry Recordable Incident Rate (“RIR” as defined by OSHA)  average for the manufacturing sector, which was 3.6 in 2016.  During fiscal 2018, we recorded an RIR of 1.42, which was slightly higher than our prior year rate of 1.31.  The increase in fiscal 2018 largely resulted from the full-year inclusion of the recently-acquired CIS segment manufacturing locations.  Throughout fiscal 2018, we implemented our behavior-based safety program at certain CIS locations in North America, Europe and Asia and expect to implement the program at the remaining CIS locations during fiscal 2019.  Our behavior-based safety program proactively seeks to correct at-risk behaviors while positively reinforcing safe behaviors.  Our focus on behavior-based safety and process stream safety are part of our long-term commitment to strengthen our safety culture.

Employees
 
We employed approximately 11,700 persons worldwide as of March 31, 2018.
 
Seasonal Nature of Business
 
Our overall operating performance is generally not subject to a significant degree of seasonality, as sales to OEM customers are dependent upon market demand for new vehicles.  However, our second fiscal quarter production schedules are typically impacted by customer summer shut downs and our third fiscal quarter is affected by holiday schedules.  Additionally, our CIS and BHVAC segments experience some seasonality as demand for HVAC&R products can be affected by heating and cooling seasons, weather patterns, construction, and other factors.  We expect sales volume within our CIS segment to be higher during our first two fiscal quarters due to the construction seasons in the northern hemisphere.  Sales volume within the BHVAC segment is generally stronger in our second and third fiscal quarters, corresponding with demand for heating products.
Working Capital
 
We manufacture products for the majority of customers in our vehicular and CIS segments on an as-ordered basis, which makes large inventories of finished products unnecessary.  In our BHVAC segment, we maintain varying levels of finished goods inventory due to seasonal demand and certain sales programs.  In Brazil, within our Americas segment, we maintain aftermarket product inventory in order to timely meet customer needs in the Brazilian automotive and commercial vehicle aftermarkets.  We do not experience a significant number of returned products within any of our operating segments.
