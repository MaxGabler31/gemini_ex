Financial Information on Segments
Veoneer reports its financial results in two segments: Electronics and Brake Systems. Our Electronics reporting segment consists of our active safety and restraint control systems product areas. Our Brake Systems reporting segment consists of our brake systems product area, which are those products developed by Veoneer-Nissin Brake Systems (VNBS), our joint venture with Nissin Kogyo the 49% owner in VNBS (a 51% owned subsidiary).
Business Strategy
We believe the Company is well-positioned for growth from increasing long-term global vehicle production volumes, increased demand for safety and collaborative and autonomous driving products, and new business wins with existing and new customers. We are focused on accelerating the commercialization of active safety and collaborative and autonomous driving by providing the software, sensors and computers required to do so. 
Products and Technology
Electronics Segment 
We provide advanced active safety sensors, used for ADAS, HAD and AD solutions, such as vision and radar systems, ADAS Electronic Control Units (“ECUs”), night vision and positioning systems. Through Zenuity, our 50% owned joint venture with Volvo Car Corporation ("Volvo Cars"), we develop an advanced software stack for sensor fusion and decision control for ADAS, HAD and AD solutions. In addition, we offer driver monitoring systems, LiDAR sensors and other technologies critical for AD solutions by leveraging our partnership network and internally developed intellectual property. 
We also provide restraint control systems such as ECUs and crash sensors for deployment of airbags and seatbelt pretensioners in the event of a collision. 
Active Safety Products
Active safety systems are designed to intervene before a collision to make accidents avoidable or reduce the severity of the crash in addition to making driving easier as well as more comfortable and convenient.
We develop radar and vision technologies (including Veoneer’s internally developed vision algorithms for both mono-and-stereo vision) that monitor the environment around the vehicle with features that adjust engine output and steering or braking to avoid accidents. The goal of active safety technologies is to provide early warnings to alert drivers to take timely and appropriate action or trigger intelligent systems that affect the vehicle’s motion using braking and steering to avoid accidents, as well as to increase the comfort and convenience of driving. Active safety systems can also improve the effectiveness of the restraint control systems which combine hazard information with traditional crash-sensing methods.

Active safety functions include: Autonomous Emergency Braking, which brakes a vehicle autonomously; Adaptive Cruise Control, which keeps and adjusts the vehicle’s pre-set speed to keep a pre-set distance from vehicles ahead; Traffic Jam Assist and Highway Assist, which takes control of braking and acceleration in slow-moving traffic and highway speed, respectively; Forward Collision Warning; Blind Spot Detection; Rear Cross-Traffic Assist; Lane Departure Warning; Lane Centering Assist, Traffic Sign Detection; Light Source Recognition; Driver Monitoring for attention and drowsiness; Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communication; and Night Driving Assist.
Key systems used in the active safety functions and the Company’s capabilities, currently provided to the market or under active development, include:
Vision Systems: Vision systems are critical to driver assistance and safety functions. They support the driver in collision avoidance and mitigating severity in the event of an accident. Using our software algorithms, the camera looks at the road ahead for other vehicles, road signs, lane markings and other key elements and provides information and warnings if the car is approaching a potentially hazardous traffic situation. Vision systems are used in applications such as road-sign recognition, lane detection along with forward and pedestrian collision warnings. We offer forward looking mono- and stereo-vision systems:
•The mono-vision system is a forward-looking camera that is mounted behind the windshield in front of the rear-view mirror. Images are interpreted by algorithms that help identify objects and assist the driver with warnings or actuations such as lane keeping and automatic braking of the vehicle. Mono-vision systems provide a significant level of accident reductions targeting 5-star safety levels as well as driver comfort and convenience features like Adaptive Cruise Control.
•Stereo-vision system technology goes a step further and measures the entire driving environment in 3D. The system is capable of acting on any object without classification. Stereo-vision also provides free-space recognition, road surface measurement down to millimeter level accuracy, which is important to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") to improve safety and comfort and provides depth perception for distance calculations due to the 3D capability.
Next generation vision systems and algorithms such as our fourth-generation mono- and stereo-cameras, which are currently under development and planned for production in 2019 will support AD and European New Car Assessment Program (“NCAP”) 2020. Fifth generation vision systems, which are in the early planning stages, and planned for production in 2022 will offer more than five times higher image resolution than the current generations as well as offer multiple camera solutions. Selected customers for our vision systems include Geely, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo Cars and one additional Asian OEM.
Radar Systems: Radar systems capture and analyze driving conditions and alert the driver to potentially dangerous events, and can take control of the vehicle if the driver does not take timely appropriate action. Radar systems are used in functions such as adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking. Radar is important because it provides superior performance in poor weather conditions such as rain and fog and other situations with poor visibility. Fused with vision systems, higher levels of functional safety are possible allowing a wider range of operating conditions. Our radar sensor portfolio includes: 25GHz ultra-wide band radar, 24 GHz narrow band radar, and 77GHz front and rear corner, and front center radars. Selected customers for our radar systems include Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), Geely, General Motor (GM), Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Renault Nissan Mitsubishi, and Volvo Cars.
ADAS ECUs: ADAS electronic control units ("ECU") are emerging products within the active safety market and are precursors to the autonomous vehicles of the future. Today, a limited number of OEMs are using separate ADAS ECUs, as most of the ADAS functionalities can be done in an integrated sensor-ECU. With future ADAS and AD systems increasing in complexity, the need for multi-sensor solutions and subsequently higher processing capabilities is expected to lead to more OEMs installing separate ADAS ECUs in their vehicles. 
In the ADAS ECU, large quantities of data from the vehicle’s different sensors is validated and analyzed. Advanced algorithms can then act in real time to warn the driver and control the vehicle throttle, braking and steering torque to follow a desired trajectory for fully automated driving. We believe one of the biggest challenges self-driving cars will have to overcome is being able to react to the randomness of traffic flow, other drivers, and the fact that no two driving situations are ever the same.
By using deep learning (artificial intelligence) and sensor fusion, algorithms in the ADAS ECU can likely be improved in such a way that the vehicle will be able to make better decisions than a human driver could. This processing must be done with multiple levels of redundancy to ensure the highest level of safety. The computing demands of driverless 
5

vehicles are 50 to 100 times more intensive than the most advanced vehicle today. Meeting these demands will be the major challenge in developing the next generation of ADAS ECUs including data processing.
In 2016, we launched the world’s first ADAS ECU for mass production in Mercedes-Benz’s new E-class. We provide a similar solution to the updated Mercedes-Benz S-class.
Night Vision Systems: Using passive infrared technology, our night vision system identifies if pedestrians, animals or certain other hazards are present in the danger zone of a vehicle, and alerts the driver, driver, particularly in nighttime, or other “dark” conditions. Our night vision system is the key component in “dynamic light spot” pedestrian illumination system which allows more time for drivers to identify potential hazards at distances beyond normal head-lights. Our fourth-generation night vision system, expected in 2020, will have improved field of view and detection distances, reduction in size, weight and cost featuring enhanced algorithms for pedestrian, animal and vehicle detection as well as supporting night time automatic emergency braking solutions. Selected customers of the night vision system include Audi, BMW, GM, Mercedes-Benz, PSA, Porsche and Volkswagen.
Safety Domain ECUs: As active and passive safety features become more advanced, having dedicated ECUs for the various features increases the complexity and cost of the vehicle architecture. The Safety Domain ECU replaces multiple dedicated ECUs across the vehicle by combining all active and passive safety ECUs into one powerful domain controller. This requires a highly powerful processor which is able to execute simultaneous computing. Techniques such as virtualization enable the safe and secure separation of computing tasks, as the other controllers are not affected if one virtual controller fails.
LiDAR: In 2017, we agreed to collaborate with Velodyne to expand and commercialize our LiDAR development. LiDAR is expected to be an important sensor technology for the future development of AD systems. Under the current agreement with Velodyne, Veoneer will act as the Tier-1 supplier to the OEMs for the Velodyne LiDAR sensors. We will provide project management services, product validation and verification capabilities and system/interface packaging in supplying automotive-grade LiDAR systems to the OEMs. Our LiDAR product roadmap includes first providing it to test fleets of the OEMs and the robo-taxis market followed by developing a solid-state design for the consumer vehicle market. Building on this relationship, on January 7, 2019 the Company announced entry into a license and supply agreement with Velodyne whereby Velodyne will provide Veoneer US, Inc. with materials and rights to certain Velodyne intellectual property which would enable Veoneer US, Inc to sell, distribute, promote, manufacture and modify, including related research and development ("R&D") certain LiDAR products based on a Velodyne-authorized reference design.
Driver Monitoring: We have been developing solutions to address driver distraction and fatigue as they relate to traditional driving situations and driver attention for hands-free driving. In 2017 we entered into an agreement with Seeing Machines to accelerate this effort. This technology is expected to be necessary to achieve a 5-star NCAP rating in Europe in 2022 as well as Level 3 autonomy solutions worldwide. Our non-exclusive agreement with Seeing Machines to utilize their reference design and market under a license, allows the Company the ability to build hardware and feature level solutions on top of Seeing Machines’s world leading head pose, gaze and recognition data outputs.
RoadScape: Our RoadScapeTM product line offers highly accurate satellite positioning along with world leading dead reckoning capabilities for increased precision in urban areas. Building on this, RoadScapeTM provides a digital representation of the road ahead that can be further enhanced through probe data in the field and cloud connectivity. Finally, adding RoadScapeTM communication technology allows for vehicle-to-vehicle, infrastructure and cloud connectivity for premonition and situational awareness in ADAS and AD.
Human Machine Interaction (“HMI”): Genuine two-way communication between vehicle and driver is critical to building driver trust and enhancing the driver experience. Veoneer’s Learning Intelligent Vehicle (“LIV”) is an artificial intelligence-equipped research vehicle that can understand and respond to context. LIV uses external and internal sensing combined with complex algorithmic artificial intelligence to create a unified contextual picture of what is going on with the occupants, vehicle, driving situation and then acts and serves as a “co-pilot” to communicate with drivers and passengers. Veoneer uses LIV to learn more about task delegation, shared control, driver-vehicle collaboration; innovate ways to increase driver understanding of an autonomous system; and to continually improve the system’s understanding of its human co-travelers.
Restraint Control Systems
The restraint control system is the brain triggering a vehicle’s passive safety system in a crash situation. Restraint control systems consist of a restraint ECU and related remote crash sensors, including acceleration and pressure sensors. The ECU’s algorithms decide when a seatbelt pretensioner should be triggered and an airbag system should be deployed.
6

The ECU is mounted centrally in the vehicle, well protected in the event of a crash, and is supported by crash sensors mounted in the door beam, the pillar between the doors, the rocker panel and/or in various locations at the front and rear of the vehicle. These “satellite” crash sensors provide acceleration data to enable early and appropriate deployment of the airbags and seatbelt pretensioners within milliseconds of a vehicle crash.
The ECU also contains certain sensors that are common with the brake system. We were the first to offer this type of solution, providing savings through the reduction in multiple sensors for measuring yaw rate, and consolidating this information on the vehicle data bus. Additionally, the restraint control system is capable of recording details of what happened before and during a crash event using an Event Data Recorder (“EDR”) with the restraint control ECU.
Selected customers include FCA, Ford, Geely, GM, Great Wall, Hyundai/Kia, Jaguar Land Rover, Mazda, PSA, Renault Nissan Mitsubishi, Suzuki and Volvo Cars.
Overview of Zenuity
In addition to our two segments, we are a 50% owner of Zenuity, our joint venture with Volvo Cars to develop decision making software for ADAS and AD. 
All ADAS and AD features are based on a recommended reference architecture for customers that require a system level solution. In March 2018 Zenuity was selected by Geely as supplier for Geely’s Level 3 project, which includes ADAS electronic control units and software, radar systems, as well as mono-vision and stereo-vision camera systems.
As of December 31, 2018, Zenuity had a team of over 600 employees and consultants, of which 88% are software engineers who we believe have the necessary skills to develop these technologies. We expect to supply customers with Zenuity software during 2020.
Through the Company's own product capabilities and extensive partnership network, Veoneer has one of the broadest ADAS and AD product portfolio offerings, which include all major sensing technologies, decision making software, positioning and mapping technologies and cloud solutions.
Our product portfolio has been significantly expanded over the recent years (as illustrated below) from individual hardware sensing components to a full range of key functions and capabilities as outlined below. This enables us to address our customer needs today, and likely in the future, by offering the entire spectrum of ADAS and AD solutions.
Brake Systems Segment
Our Brake Systems reporting segment consists of our brake systems product area, which are those products developed by VNBS which provides brake control and actuation systems. VNBS provides products for both traditional and new braking systems which we see as building blocks in the actuator area towards HAD.
VNBS supplies brake systems, including the brake booster, hydraulic proportioning valves and electronic control module with sensors. The control module can modulate the brake pressure applied on each wheel individually to maintain optimum braking and offers features like Electronic Stability Control (“ESC”), Anti-locking Brakes (“ABS”) and Traction Control System.
For traditional brakes, a vacuum produced by Internal Combustion Engines is necessary to amplify the force applied by the driver’s foot to convert it into hydraulic pressure to decelerate the vehicle. New drivetrains, such as Electric (“EV”) and Hybrid (“HEV”), do not provide the same source of energy for boosting the brake input from the driver. Therefore, VNBS has developed new servo-assisted and integrated brake control systems that can work independent of the type of drivetrain used.
To improve the overall efficiency of vehicles, VNBS’ new braking systems also provide the opportunity to recover brake energy using electric motors as generators to charge batteries. This contrasts with conventional braking systems where the excess kinetic energy is converted to unwanted and wasted heat by friction in the brakes.
VNBS currently produces brake systems capable of coping with regenerative braking and has developed an upgraded Electronic Brake Boost system for market introduction expected towards the end of 2019. This system integrates the hydraulic brake modulator with the electronic brake control unit and the brake fluid reservoir into a single unit (so called “one box” design). Scalability and cost competitiveness of this technology qualifies VNBS to participate in the growth of brake-by-wire systems needed for regenerative braking while delivering superior braking performance to support the growing need for external brake requests such as Automated Emergency Braking and other functionalities.
7

In January 2017 the Company announced that VNBS is expanding its customer base beyond its primary customer Honda, winning lifetime contract order value of more than $1 billion for our new braking system with a Detroit based OEM on a major vehicle platform. Production for this awarded business is currently scheduled to begin in 2020. There is no minimum purchase value associated with this awarded business. The agreement will be governed by the OEM’s general terms and conditions and Veoneer and such OEM will enter into a commercial and program agreement that will set forth the specific commercial terms and functional requirements with respect to this order. The program life cycle is estimated to be six years. We received a second major order from the same OEM at the end of 2017. The main opportunities we see in brake systems stem from its capabilities in regenerative braking technology which works well with combustion engine vehicles but is even more suitable for HEV and EV. We see significant opportunities to expand outside the current customer base, especially in combination with our strong customer relationships and global footprint.

Market Overview and Competitive Landscape
Automotive Supplier Market Overview
The automotive production value chain is split among OEMs such as General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen and automotive suppliers, such as ourselves, Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, Denso, Magna, Valeo and ZF. Veoneer acts mainly as a Tier-1 supplier to OEMs, meaning that we sell products directly to OEMs.
Our underlying market is primarily driven by two critical factors: Global Light Vehicle Production (“LVP”) and Content Per Vehicle (“CPV”), whereby CPV is the clear market driver for the growth of our total addressable market.
Light Vehicle Production: Over the last two decades, LVP has increased at an average annual growth rate of around 3% despite the cyclical nature of the automotive industry. LVP is expected to grow to around 92 million in 2019, and 106 million in 2025, from approximately 91 million in 2018, according to IHS, The market is undergoing a shift from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, to HEVs and EVs, as emission regulation becomes more stringent, and battery technology continues to evolve.
Content Per Vehicle: Unlike LVP, we can directly influence the CPV by introducing new technologies to the market. Looking ahead, we expect that safety CPV growth will primarily be driven by active safety content (including software), with total active safety market growing from approximately $75 per vehicle in 2018 to approximately $250 per vehicle in 2025, representing a compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of roughly 19% from 2018 to 2025, as the demand for advanced active safety features grows.
See Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Trends, Uncertainties and Opportunities” for additional information related to recent trends in LVP and CPV.
Active Safety Competitive Landscape
The active safety market is highly fragmented and highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on technology, innovation, quality, delivery and price. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop advanced hardware and software technologies and to maintain or improve on our already strong competitive position over our existing and any new competitors. Main competitors in active safety include Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, Denso, Magna, Valeo, ZF, and Intel/Mobileye.
On a broader scale, we have seen significant shifts in our competitive landscape over the last several years. Technology companies have increased their presence and influence in ADAS and AD either through acquisitions or forming “ecosystems” around certain technologies with OEMs and other suppliers. This has led to new industry entrants like Apple, Google, Intel, NVIDIA, Qualcomm and Uber, which also provide partnership or customer opportunities for Veoneer hardware and software solutions.
Through acquisitions, technology partnerships with customers and licensing agreements we have continuously added key building blocks and we estimate to have obtained a market share of 12% in active safety in 2018. Zenuity has since inception formed several partnerships to establish a full-suite ecosystem and competes with peer ecosystems such as the BMW/Intel/Mobileye collaboration.
Restraint Control Systems Competitive Landscape
The market for restraint control systems remains relatively fragmented with both traditional electronics suppliers and some passive safety suppliers. Over the past few years, we have seen our market share increase mainly due to cost efficient integration solutions and strong customer relationships built on quality and technology advancements. Currently we are the leading supplier of restraint control systems with a market share of around 26% in 2018. Our largest competitors include Bosch, Continental, Denso and ZF.
The total restraint control systems market amounted to approximately $4 billion in 2018 and is expected to remain at the same level until 2025. We believe that restraint control systems will play an integral role in a larger integration trend towards centralized Safety Domain Controllers in the future. In addition, our strong market position in restraint control systems will provide opportunities to become a leading supplier in the ADAS ECU and eventually the Safety Domain Controller market.
9

Brake Systems Competitive Landscape
Brake systems consists of brake control ECUs, including ABS and ESC as well as brake apply units. We estimate the total brake systems market to be approximately $12 billion in 2018, with a projected CAGR of 3% through 2025. The main growth driver is higher installation rates of ESC systems in China and other emerging countries in Asia. Another major growth driver is more advanced and complex servo assisted systems and regenerative braking systems for HEVs and EVs. The ability to regenerate kinetic energy through braking is of growing importance as vehicle powertrains are becoming increasingly electrified. We estimate that VNBS had a market share of just above 4% in 2018. Main competitors of VNBS include ADVICS, Bosch, Continental, Mando and ZF.
Research & Development and Intellectual Property
Our ability to maintain our position at the forefront of technological innovations and to serve customers on a local basis will be differentiating factors to our success. Therefore, we maintain one of the broadest global networks of technical engineering centers across all major automotive regions to develop and provide advanced products, processes and manufacturing support for our manufacturing sites and to provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design development on a global basis.
We currently own or co-own approximately 738 active patents and have approximately 710 pending patent applications in the US and other jurisdictions. The active patents will expire between 2019 and 2038. We have registered the name Veoneer as a trademark in Sweden and are pursuing registration in other markets of interest. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not been found to have become generic.
We are actively pursuing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to the automotive industries, and we selectively utilize other companies’ licenses through sublicenses in order to support our business interests. These activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights.
We believe that our patents, trademarks and licenses, provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations and as a whole, to be material to our business. However, we do not consider our business or any of our business segments to be materially dependent upon any individual patent, trademark or license.
We seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by evaluating the market and profit potential of existing and new customer programs, including investments in innovation and technology. We maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products and distinctive technologies.
Our total research and development expenses, including engineering, net of customer reimbursements, were $466 million, $375 million and $300 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Zenuity’s total expenses were $125 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. These expenses were mainly related to research and development. 
We believe that our engineering and technical expertise, together with our emphasis on continuing research and development, allows us to use the latest technologies, materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new innovative products to market. We believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products.
Dependence on Customers
Veoneer serves most of the world’s major automotive OEMs and is not dependent on one single customer. Our customer base has consistently increased and diversified over the last five years, mainly driven by our active safety product offerings and VNBS.
In 2018 we served a total of 16 customers and our largest customers were Honda (21% of sales), Daimler (17% of sales), Ford (11% of sales), Hyundai/Kia (10% of sales), General Motors (8% of sales), Renault Nissan Mitsubishi (7% of sales) FCA (5% of sales) and BMW (5% of sales). Some of the concentration is driven by the concentration in the automotive industry, with the five largest OEMs in 2018 accounting for 49% of global LVP and the ten largest for 74%, according to IHS.
We typically supply products to our OEM customers through written contracts or purchase orders which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each OEM. These arrangements include terms regarding price, quality, technology and delivery. Although it may vary from customer to customer, our customer contracts generally require us to supply a customer’s annual requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly facilities, rather than for manufacturing a specific quantity of products. Such contracts range from one year to the life of the model, which is generally four to seven years. Because we produce products for a broad cross section of vehicle models, we are not overly reliant on any one vehicle model or one particular product.
10

These contracts are often subject to renegotiation, sometimes as frequent as on an annual basis which may affect product pricing. In general, these arrangements with our customers provide that the customer can terminate them if we do not meet specified quality, delivery and cost requirements. Although these arrangements may be terminated at any time by our customers (but not typically by us), such terminations have historically been minimal and have not had a material impact on our results of operations. However, if terminations do occur in the future or if production under a contract winds down earlier than expected, then such event could have a material impact on our results of operations. The arrangements typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied; in most cases, the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the OEM to the end-user of the vehicle. We may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the OEM recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products. 
Veoneer Personnel
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of approximately 8,600 employees and consultants, with 4,676 in engineering, 2,083 in production and 1,346 in production overhead, and the remainder employed in management, general and administrative functions. Within engineering, more than two thirds of the employees worked as software engineers.
In addition, Zenuity had approximately 600 employees and consultants at the end of 2018, of which approximately 88% worked as software developers. In 2018, approximately 1,100 engineers were hired by Veoneer and more than 100 were hired by Zenuity.
We consider our relationship with our personnel to be strong. We have not had any disputes which are significant or had a lasting impact on our relationship with our employees, customer perception of our employee practices or our business results.
Major unions to which some of our employees belong in Europe include: IG Metall in Germany; Unite in the United Kingdom; Confédération Générale des Travailleurs, Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail, and Force Ouvrière in France; and If Metall, Unionen, Sveriges Ingenjörer and Akademikerföreningen in Sweden.
In addition, our employees in other regions are represented by the following unions: Unifor and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (“IAM”) in Canada and VNBS Roudou Kumiai in Japan.
In many European countries and in Canada, wages, salaries and general working conditions are negotiated with local unions and/or are subject to centrally negotiated collective bargaining agreements. The terms of our various agreements with unions typically range between one and three years. Some of our subsidiaries in Europe and Canada must negotiate with the applicable local unions with respect to important changes in operations, working and employment conditions. Twice a year, members of the Company’s management conduct a meeting with the European Works Council (“EWC”) to provide employee representatives with important information about the Company and a forum for the exchange of ideas and opinions.
In many Asia Pacific countries, the central or regional governments provide guidance each year for salary adjustments or statutory minimum wage for workers. Our employees may join associations in accordance with local legislation and rules, although the level of unionization varies significantly throughout our operations.
Inventory and Working Capital
We, as with other component manufactures in the automotive industry, ship our products to customer vehicle assembly facilities throughout the world on a “just-in-time” basis for our customers to maintain low inventory levels. Our suppliers (external suppliers as well as our own production sites) use a similar method in providing raw materials to us.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We procure our raw materials and components from a variety of suppliers around the world. Generally, we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured to minimize transportation, currency risks and other costs. The most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products are various electrical components and ferrous metals for brake systems. As of December 31, 2018, we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials more than those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules.
Commodity cost volatility is a challenge for us and our industry. We are continually seeking to manage these costs using a combination of strategies, including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs, seeking alternative product designs and material specifications, combining our purchase requirements with our customers and/or suppliers, changing suppliers, hedging certain commodities and other means. Our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited. We will continue our efforts to pass market-driven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts, including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire.

Seasonality
Our business is moderately seasonal. Our European customers generally reduce production during the months of July and August and for one week in December. Our North American customers historically reduce production during the month of July and halt operations for approximately one week in December. Our Chinese customers generally reduce production during the Chinese New Year period in February. Shut-down periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country. In addition, automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of July, August and September due to the launch of parts production for new vehicle models. Accordingly, our results reflect this seasonality. In addition, engineering income tends to be skewed towards the fourth quarter.
Environmental Compliance
We are subject to various environmental regulations governing, among other things: (i) the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation, presence of, or exposure to hazardous materials; (ii) the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; (iii) the incorporation of certain chemical substances into our products, including electronic equipment; and (iv) the health and safety of our employees.
Most of the Company’s manufacturing processes consist of the assembly of components. As a result, the environmental impact from the Company’s plants is generally modest. While our businesses from time to time are subject to environmental investigations, there are no material environmental-related cases pending against the Company. Therefore, we do not incur (or expect to incur) any material costs or capital expenditures associated with maintaining facilities compliant with U.S. or non-U.S. environmental requirements. To reduce environmental risk, the Company has implemented an environmental management system in all plants globally and has adopted an environmental policy.
We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S., laws and regulations, including those related to environmental, health and safety, financial and other matters. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof. The introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations that impact our business, or the interpretations thereof, could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
We are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations.
Dependency on Government Contracts
We are not dependent on government contracts. Some R&D projects are partly financed by certain government agencies.
Joint Venture Agreements
Zenuity Joint Venture Agreement
Zenuity operates pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement, dated April 18, 2017 (the “Zenuity JV Agreement”), between Volvo Cars and a subsidiary of Veoneer. The Zenuity JV Agreement describes the scope of the business activities of Zenuity, which is to develop automotive driver assistance and highly autonomous driving software solutions that can be supplied to Volvo Cars and other potential customers. In addition, Zenuity conducts research within the areas of human factors, vehicle environments and computer techniques to develop algorithms for driving assistance or automated driving. Zenuity owns and licenses certain intellectual property rights pursuant to commercialization agreements between the parties. Veoneer is the exclusive supplier and distribution channel for all Zenuity’s products sold to third parties; however, there is no exclusivity toward any customer or the owners. Volvo Cars can source such products directly from Zenuity. The parties also entered into a number of related agreements in connection with forming the joint venture, including an investment agreement, commercialization agreements and intellectual property license and assignment agreements pursuant to which Volvo Cars and Veoneer transferred certain intellectual property rights to Zenuity. A copy of the Zenuity JV Agreement has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
VNBS Joint Venture Agreement
Brake Systems was formed by and operates pursuant to a number of agreements entered into between certain affiliates of each of Veoneer and Nissin Kogyo Ltd., Co. (“Nissin”), including a Share Purchase Agreement, dated September 9, 2015, and a Joint Venture Agreement, dated March 7, 2016 (the “VNBS JV Agreement”). The VNBS JV Agreement sets forth the agreements between Veoneer and Nissin with respect to the ownership, capitalization, governance and operations of Brake Systems. It provides that Veoneer owns 51% of each of the entities that comprise Brake Systems and Nissin owns the remaining 49% of each entity. A copy of the VNBS JV Agreement has been filed with the SEC.

Since the Company acquired a 51% interest in VNBS, Veoneer has unilaterally provided the funds necessary to meet VNBS’s operational needs as Nissin Kogyo has, notwithstanding repeated requests, refused to provide funding in proportion to its ownership. In 2019, the Company initiated a formal negotiation process under the VNBS JV Agreement to find a resolution to the current funding situation. 
Spin-Off Related Agreements
As part of the Spin-Off, Autoliv underwent an internal reorganization, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to limited exceptions, all of the assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) associated with the electronics business of Autoliv were retained by or transferred to Veoneer or our subsidiaries and all other assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) of Autoliv were retained by or transferred to Autoliv or its subsidiaries (other than Veoneer).
Following the Spin-Off, the Company and Autoliv began operating independently and neither has any ownership interest in the other. To govern certain ongoing relationships between Veoneer and Autoliv after the Spin-Off and to provide mechanisms for an orderly transition, the Company and Autoliv entered into agreements pursuant to which certain services and rights are provided for following the Spin-Off, and the Company and Autoliv will indemnify each other against certain liabilities arising from our respective businesses. 
Distribution Agreement
In connection with the internal reorganization, we entered into a Master Transfer Agreement with Autoliv which was amended and restated effective as of the Spin-Off (the “Distribution Agreement”). The Distribution Agreement governs certain transfers of assets and assumptions of liabilities by each of Veoneer and Autoliv and the settlement or extinguishment of certain liabilities and other obligations among the companies and their subsidiaries. In particular, substantially all of the assets and liabilities associated with the separated Electronics business were retained by or transferred to Veoneer or its subsidiaries and all other assets and liabilities were retained by or transferred to Autoliv or its subsidiaries. The Distribution Agreement also provided the principal corporate transactions required to affect the Spin-Off, certain conditions to the Spin-Off and provisions governing the relationship between Veoneer and Autoliv with respect to and resulting from the completion of the Spin-Off. The Distribution Agreement also provides for indemnification obligations designed to make the Company financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the completion of the internal reorganization, as well as those obligations of Autoliv assumed by us pursuant to the Master Transfer Agreement; provided, however, certain warranty, recall and product liabilities for Electronics products manufactured prior to the completion of the internal reorganization were retained by Autoliv and Autoliv will indemnify us for any losses associated with such warranty, recall or product liabilities. 
Employee Matters Agreement
The Employee Matters Agreement governs Autoliv’s and Veoneer’s compensation and employee benefit obligations with respect to the current and former employees and non-employee directors of each company. Under the agreement, Autoliv is responsible for liabilities associated with Autoliv allocated employees and liabilities associated with former employees and Veoneer is responsible for liabilities associated with Veoneer allocated employees, but Autoliv retains and continues to be responsible for certain post-retirement liabilities relating to plans sponsored by Autoliv. The Employee Matters Agreement provided for the conversion of the outstanding awards granted under the Autoliv equity compensation programs into adjusted awards relating to both shares of Autoliv and Veoneer common stock.
Tax Matters Agreement
The Tax Matters Agreement governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Autoliv and Veoneer with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. The agreement also specifies the portion, if any, of this tax liability for which Veoneer will bear responsibility and provides for certain indemnification provisions with respect to amounts for which they are not responsible. In addition, under the agreement, each party is expected to be responsible for any taxes imposed on Autoliv that arise from the failure of the Spin-Off and certain related transactions to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Amended and Restated Transition Services Agreement
Under the Amended and Restated Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”), Autoliv and Veoneer agreed to provide to each other certain services for a limited time to help ensure an orderly transition following the Spin-Off. The services that Autoliv provides include certain finance, information technology, human resources and compensation, facilities, legal and compliance and other services. We pay Autoliv for any such services utilized at agreed amounts as set forth in the TSA. In addition, for a term set forth in the TSA, we and Autoliv may mutually agree on additional services to be provided by Autoliv to us that were provided to us by Autoliv prior to the distribution but were omitted from the TSA at pricing based on market rates that are reasonably agreed by the parties.
