Item 1. Business
Performance Food Group Company (“we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or “PFG”), through its subsidiaries, markets and distributes more than 250,000 food and food-related products from 142 distribution centers to over 300,000 customer locations across the United States. Our more than 35,000 employees serve a diverse mix of customers, from independent and chain restaurants to schools, business and industry locations, hospitals, vending distributors, office coffee service distributors, retailers, convenience stores, and theaters. We source our products from various suppliers and serve as an important partner to our suppliers by providing them access to our broad customer base. In addition to the products we offer to our customers, we provide value-added services by allowing our customers to benefit from our industry knowledge, scale, and expertise in the areas of product selection and procurement, menu development, and operational strategy.

On September 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Core-Mark. As a result, we expanded our convenience business, which now includes operations in Canada. Refer to Note 4. Business Combinations within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements "("Item 8") for additional details regarding the acquisition of Core-Mark.
 
Our business, our industry and the U.S. economy are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors, including, but not limited to, the recent rise in the rate of inflation and fuel prices, interest rates, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. We continue to actively monitor the impacts of the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape on all aspects of our business. During fiscal 2022, economic and operating conditions for our business improved significantly due to the declining adverse effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Company and our industry may continue to face challenges as the recovery continues, such as availability of product supply, increased product and logistics costs, access to labor supply, lower disposable incomes due to inflationary pressures and macroeconomic conditions, and the emergence of COVID-19 variants. The extent to which these challenges will affect our future financial position, liquidity, and results of operations remains uncertain. For further information on the risks posed to our business, please see Item 1A.
 Our Segments

In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company changed its operating segments to reflect the manner in which the business is managed. Based on the Company’s organization structure and how the Company’s management reviews operating results and makes decisions about resource allocation, the Company now has three reportable segments: Foodservice, Vistar, and Convenience. Corporate & All Other is comprised of corporate overhead and certain operating segments that are not considered separate reportable segments based on their size. This includes the operations of the Company’s internal logistics unit responsible for managing and allocating inbound logistics revenue and expense.
 Foodservice. Foodservice offers a “broad line” of products, including custom-cut meat and seafood, as well as products that are specific to our customers’ menu requirements. Foodservice operates a network of 78 distribution centers, each of which is run by a business team who understands the local markets and the needs of its particular customers and who is empowered to make decisions on how best to serve them. This segment serves over 175,000 customer locations.
The Foodservice segment markets and distributes food and food-related products to independent restaurants, chain restaurants, and other institutional “food-away-from-home” locations. Independent customers, predominantly include family dining, bar and grill, pizza and Italian, and fast casual restaurants. We seek to increase the mix of our total sales to independent customers because they typically use more value-added services, particularly in the areas of product selection and procurement, market trends, menu development, and operational strategy and also use more of our proprietary-branded products (“Performance Brands”), which are our highest margin products. As a result, independent customers generate higher gross profit per case that more than offsets the generally higher supply chain costs that we incur in serving these customers. Chain customers are multi-unit restaurants with five or more locations and include fine dining, family and casual dining, fast casual, and quick serve restaurants, as well as hotels, healthcare facilities, and other multi-unit institutional customers. Our Foodservice segment’s chain customers include regional businesses requiring short-haul routes as well as national businesses requiring long-haul routes, including many of the most recognizable family and casual dining restaurant chains. Sales to chain customers are typically lower gross margin but have larger deliveries than those to independent customers.
 We offer our customers a broad product assortment that ranges from “center-of-the-plate” items (such as beef, pork, poultry, and seafood), frozen foods, refrigerated products, and dry groceries to disposables, cleaning and kitchen supplies, and related products used by our customers. In addition to the products we offer, we provide value-added services by enabling our customers to benefit from our industry knowledge, scale, and expertise in the areas of product selection and procurement, menu development, and operational strategy.

Our products consist of Performance Brands, as well as nationally branded products and products bearing our customers’ brands. Our Performance Brands typically generate higher gross profit per case than other brands. Nationally branded products are attractive to chain, independent, and other customers seeking recognized national brands in their operations and complement sales of our Performance Brand products. Some of our chain customers, particularly those with national distribution, develop exclusive stock keeping units (“SKU”) specifications directly with suppliers and brand these SKUs. We purchase these SKUs directly from suppliers and receive them into our distribution centers, where they are mixed with other SKUs and delivered to the chain customers’ locations.
 Vistar. Vistar is a leading national distributor of candy, snacks, and beverages to vending and office coffee service distributors, retailers, theaters, and hospitality providers. The segment provides national distribution of candy, snacks, beverages, and other items to over 75,000 customer locations from our network of 25 Vistar distribution centers and 4 Merchant’s Marts locations.
Vending operators comprise Vistar’s largest channel, where we distribute a broad selection of vending machine products to the operators’ depots, from which they distribute products and stock machines. Additionally, Vistar is a leading distributor of products to theater chains as well as in the office coffee service channel. Vistar has successfully built upon our national platform to broaden the channels we serve to include hospitality venues, concessionaires, airport gift shops, college bookstores, corrections facilities, and impulse locations in various brick and mortar big box retailers nationwide. Merchant’s Marts are cash-and-carry operators where customers generally pick up orders rather than having them delivered. Vistar’s scale in these channels enhances our ability to procure a broad variety of products for our customers. Vistar distribution centers deliver to vending and office coffee service distributors and directly to most theaters and some other locations. The distribution model also includes a “pick and pack” capability, which utilizes third-party carriers and Vistar’s SKU variety to sell to customers whose order sizes are too small to be served effectively by our delivery network. We believe these capabilities, in conjunction with the breadth of our inventory, are differentiating and allow us to serve many distinct customer types.
 Convenience. The Convenience segment is one of the largest foodservice and wholesaler consumer products distributors in the convenience retail industry. Convenience offers a full range of products, marketing programs and technology solutions to approximately 50,000 customer locations in the United States and Canada. The Convenience segment's customers include traditional convenience stores, drug stores, mass merchants, grocery stores, liquor stores and other specialty and small format stores that carry convenience products. Convenience's product offering includes cigarettes, other tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, candy, snacks, food, including fresh products, groceries dairy, bread, beverages, general merchandise and health and beauty care products. Convenience operates a network of 39 distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada (excluding two distribution facilities it operates as a third-party logistics provider). There are 35 distribution centers located in the U.S. and four located in Canada.
 The Company had no customers that comprised more than 10% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2020, one of the Company’s customers within the Convenience segment accounted for 10.2% of our total net sales.
Suppliers
 We source our products from various suppliers and serve as an important partner to our suppliers by providing them access to our broad customer base. Many of our suppliers provide products to each of our reportable segments, while others sell to only one segment. Our supplier base consists principally of large corporations that sell their national brands, our Performance Brands, and sometimes both. We also buy from smaller suppliers, particularly on a regional basis, and particularly those that specialize in produce and other perishable commodities. Many of our suppliers provide sales material and sales call support for the products that we purchase.
Pricing
Our pricing to customers is either set by contract with the customer or is priced at the time of order. If the price is by contract, then it is either based on a percentage markup over cost or a fixed markup per unit, and the unit may be expressed either in cases or pounds of product. If the pricing is set at time of order, the pricing is agreed to between our sales associate and the customer and is typically based on a product cost that fluctuates weekly or more frequently.
If contracts are based on a fixed markup per unit or pound, then our customers bear the risk of cost fluctuations during the contract life. In the case of a fixed markup percentage, we typically bear the risk of cost deflation or the benefit of cost inflation. If pricing is set at the time of order, we have the current cost of goods in our inventory and typically pass cost increases or decreases to our customers. We generally do not lock in or otherwise hedge commodity costs or other costs of goods sold except within certain customer contracts where the customer bears the risk of cost fluctuation. We believe that our pricing mechanisms provide us with significant insulation from fluctuations in the cost of goods that we sell. Our inventory turns, on average, every three-and-a-half weeks, which further protects us from cost fluctuations.

We seek to minimize the effect of higher diesel fuel costs both by reducing fuel usage and by taking action to offset higher fuel prices. We reduce usage by designing more efficient truck routes and by increasing miles per gallon through on-board computers that monitor and adjust idling time and maximum speeds and through other technologies. We seek to manage fuel prices through diesel fuel surcharges to our customers and through the use of costless collars. As of July 2, 2022, we had collars in place for approximately 24% of the gallons we expect to use over the 12 months following July 2, 2022.
Competition
 The foodservice distribution industry is highly competitive. Certain of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. Furthermore, there are two large broadline distributors, Sysco, and US Foods, with national footprints. In addition, there are numerous regional, local, and specialty distributors. These smaller distributors often align themselves with other smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their geographic reach, private label offerings, overall purchasing power, cost efficiencies, and to assemble delivery networks for national or multi-regional distribution. We often do not have exclusive service agreements with our customers and our customers may switch to other distributors if those distributors can offer lower prices, differentiated products, or customer service that is perceived to be superior. We believe that most purchasing decisions in the foodservice business are based on the quality and price of the product and a distributor’s ability to fill orders completely and accurately and to provide timely deliveries.
We believe we have a competitive advantage over regional and local broadline distributors through economies of scale in purchasing and procurement, which allow us to offer a broad variety of products (including our proprietary Performance Brands) at competitive prices to our customers. Our customers benefit from our ability to provide them with extensive geographic coverage as they continue to grow. We believe we also benefit from supply chain efficiency, including a growing inbound logistics backhaul network that uses our collective distribution network to deliver inbound products across business segments; best practices in warehousing, transportation, and risk management; the ability to benefit from the scale of our purchases of items not for resale, such as trucks, construction materials, insurance, banking relationships, healthcare, and material handling equipment; and the ability to optimize our networks so that customers are served from the most efficient distribution centers, which minimizes the cost of delivery. We believe these efficiencies and economies of scale provide opportunities for improvements in our operating margins when combined with an incremental fixed-cost advantage.
Seasonality
Historically, the food-away-from-home and foodservice distribution industries are seasonal, with lower profit in the first and third quarters of each calendar year. Consequently, we typically experience lower operating profit during our third fiscal quarter, depending on the timing of acquisitions, if any. The acquisition of Core-Mark expanded the Company's convenience business which is expected to result in first fiscal quarter profit higher than historical trends since this channel generally performs stronger in the spring and summer months. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its accompanying impacts have resulted in a disruption to historic seasonal trends in recent years and may continue to impact seasonal trends in future periods.
 Trademarks and Trade Names
We have numerous perpetual trademarks and trade names that are of significant importance, including Core-Mark, West Creek, Silver Source, Braveheart 100% Black Angus, Empire’s Treasure, Brilliance, Heritage Ovens, Village Garden, Guest House, Piancone, Luigi’s, Ultimo, Corazo, Assoluti, Peak Fresh Produce, Roma, First Mark, and Nature’s Best Dairy. Although in the aggregate these trademark and trade names are material to our results of operations, we believe the loss of a trademark or trade name individually would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The Company does not have any material patents or licenses.
Human Capital Resources
 One of our primary strategies is to attract, train, develop, and retain talented individuals who feel empowered to fully contribute their diverse backgrounds, experiences, and innovative ideas to the success of the Company. We also recognize the importance of keeping our associates safe and healthy, as well as giving them a voice and listening to their concerns and suggestions. Below, we discuss our efforts to achieve these objectives.
 Associates. As of July 2, 2022, our employee population (including employees of our consolidated subsidiaries) totaled approximately 35,000 full-time and part-time employees in the U.S and Canada. Of that total, approximately 99% were employed on a full-time basis, and approximately 66% were non-exempt, or paid on an hourly basis.

Compensation and Benefits. We believe our base wages and salaries, which we review annually, are fair and competitive with the external labor markets in which our associates work. We offer incentive programs that provide cash bonus opportunities to encourage and reward participants for the Company’s achievement of financial and other key performance metrics and strengthen the connection between pay and performance. We also grant equity compensation awards that vest over time through our long-term incentive plan to eligible associates to align such associates’ incentives with the Company’s long-term strategic objectives and the interests of our stockholders.
 We also offer competitive benefits to our associates, including paid vacation and holidays, family leave, disability insurance, life insurance, healthcare, adoption assistance, tuition reimbursement, dependent care flexible spending accounts, a 401(k) plan with a company match, and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Additionally, we offer an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that includes professional support for associates to balance the stress of personal and professional demands at home, in the office, in distribution centers and on the road.
 Workforce Diversity. As a company we are committed to building an inclusive and equitable culture that embraces and celebrates our associates’ diverse backgrounds and unique experiences. In fiscal 2022, we implemented a Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DI&B) framework that includes, among other things, a focus on clear leadership roles and accountability, new talent acquisition practices, employee communities, and inclusive performance management. Our Vice President of DI&B also provides regular updates to the Company's Board of Directors. With five out of 11 members of the Board representing gender and ethnic diversity, our commitment to ensure workforce diversity is reflected at every level of the organization connects to our social responsibility and business imperatives.
 Learning and Development. We have an enterprise-wide learning and development strategy that has allowed us to build a lifelong learning culture by focusing on attracting, retaining and preparing our workforce for success in current roles and developing our future leaders. Using a blended approach of instructor-led and self-paced training, our associates are provided role-specific training that is just-in-time, accessible and personalized. The learning journey for our associates starts with an onboarding experience and continues with individual development opportunities. Our E3 Leadership Development program is designed to provide leadership training opportunities for all levels of leadership, from entry level to executive, advancing leadership skills at every point of their career. Through our Learning Management System (LMS), we deliver a variety of required and optional on-demand learning modules that are linked to an associate’s role with the company, including those modules tied to safety and compliance, such as our Code of Business Conduct. Additionally, our Foodservice segment continues to provide a sales training program that prepares our sales associates for success and sets our sales leaders apart to promote long-term customer relationships and positive customer experiences. We are focused on empowering associates with the right training at the right time, throughout their career journey.
 Health, Safety and Wellness. The safety of our associates is paramount. Emphasis on training, safety awareness, behavioral based work observation practices, telematics, and culture is the foundation in our continuous effort to reduce workplace injuries and accidents. We continue to focus on the safety of our team members and the motoring public by identifying and addressing safety risks through education, coaching, and process changes, and by seeking out new systems and technology to help us continue our journey in keeping our associates safe and our company compliant.
 Engagement. We work to build, measure, and enhance associate engagement through a variety of communications and activities. We participate in, and celebrate, industry efforts such as the International Foodservice Distributors Association’s Truck Driving Championship and Truck Driver Hall of Fame, highlight locally and internally/externally share significant achievements for our warehouse associates, and honor the diversity of our associates, along with our customers and communities, by celebrating, among other things, heritage months. Community support efforts such as Feeding American’s Hunger Action Month, promoting Truckers Against Trafficking, and supporting American Red Cross disaster relief efforts also provide opportunities to engage our associates. In response to the results of our first enterprise-wide engagement survey in 2020, we identified and delivered a number of initiatives to strengthen the associate experience, including day one benefits, the E3 leadership training program, driver and selector career pathing and enhanced communications channels.
Regulation
Our operations are subject to regulation by state and local health departments, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), which generally impose standards for product quality and sanitation and are responsible for the administration of bioterrorism legislation affecting the foodservice industry. These government authorities regulate, among other things, the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, and labeling of our products. In 2010, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (the “FSMA”) was enacted. The FSMA requires that the FDA impose comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain, further regulates food products imported into the United States, and provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority. The FSMA requires the FDA to undertake numerous rulemakings and to issue numerous guidance documents, as well as reports, plans, standards, notices, and other tasks. As a result, implementation of the legislation is ongoing and likely to take several years. Our seafood operations are also specifically regulated by federal and state laws, including those administered by the National Marine Fisheries Service, established for the preservation of certain species of marine life,

including fish and shellfish. Our processing and distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections. State and/or federal authorities generally inspect our facilities at least annually. The Federal Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, which specifies standards for the sale, shipment, inspection, and rejection of agricultural products, governs our relationships with our fresh food suppliers with respect to the grading and commercial acceptance of product shipments. We are also subject to regulation by state authorities for the accuracy of our weighing and measuring devices. Our suppliers are also subject to similar regulatory requirements and oversight.
The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, administrative, civil, or criminal penalties or fines, mandatory or voluntary product recalls, warning or untitled letters, cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance, closure of facilities or operations, the loss, revocation, or modification of any existing licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals, or the failure to obtain additional licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These laws and regulations may change in the future and we may incur material costs in our efforts to comply with current or future laws and regulations or in any required product recalls.
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and other requirements, including, employment practice standards for workers set by the U.S. Department of Labor, and relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public. These include requirements regarding the use, storage, and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and petroleum products, including food processing wastes, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, and worker safety and health practices and procedures. In order to comply with environmental, health, and safety requirements, we may be required to spend money to monitor, maintain, upgrade, or replace our equipment; plan for certain contingencies; acquire or maintain environmental permits; file periodic reports with regulatory authorities; or investigate and clean up contamination. We operate and maintain vehicle fleets, and some of our distribution centers have regulated underground and aboveground storage tanks for diesel fuel and other petroleum products. Some jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that affect the composition and operation of our truck fleet, such as limits on diesel emissions and engine idling. A number of our facilities have ammonia- or freon-based refrigeration systems, which could cause injury or environmental damage if accidentally released, and many of our distribution centers have propane or battery powered forklifts. Proposed or recently enacted legal requirements, such as those requiring the phase-out of certain ozone-depleting substances and proposals for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, may require us to upgrade or replace equipment, or may increase our transportation or other operating costs. To date, our cost of compliance with environmental, health, and safety requirements has not been material. The discovery of contamination for which we are responsible, any accidental release of regulated materials, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced could require us to incur additional costs or subject us to unexpected liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
The Surface Transportation Board and the Federal Highway Administration regulate our trucking operations. In addition, interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed in the U.S. Department of Transportation and other relevant federal and state agencies. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements relating to our motor carrier operations. Failure to comply with the applicable motor carrier regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits.
