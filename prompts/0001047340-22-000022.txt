Item 1. Business
Business Overview
Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. (the “Company,” “we” or “us”) is one of the world’s leading vertically integrated producers, marketers and distributors of high-quality fresh and fresh-cut fruit and vegetables, as well as a leading producer and distributor of prepared fruit and vegetables, juices, beverages and snacks in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. We market our products worldwide primarily under the Del Monte® brand, a symbol of product innovation, quality, freshness and reliability since 1892. Our global sourcing and logistics network allows us to provide consistent delivery of high-quality products and value-added services to our customers.
We have leading market positions in the following product categories and we believe we are:
•the largest marketer of fresh pineapples in the United States, and a leading marketer in other markets worldwide;
•the third-largest marketer of bananas in the United States, and a leading marketer in other markets worldwide;
•a leading marketer of:
◦fresh-cut fruit in the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia;
◦fresh and fresh-cut vegetable products (including fresh-cut salads) in North America, South Korea, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia;
◦grapes and avocados in the United States; 
◦non-tropical fruit in select markets; and
◦canned fruit in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.
Our vision is to inspire healthy lifestyles through wholesome and convenient products. Our strategy is founded on six goals:
Our business is comprised of three reportable segments, two of which represent our primary businesses of fresh and value-added products and banana, and one that represents our other ancillary businesses.
•Fresh and value-added products - includes pineapples, fresh-cut fruit, fresh-cut vegetables (which includes fresh-cut salads), melons, vegetables, non-tropical fruit (including grapes, apples, citrus, blueberries, strawberries, pears, peaches, plums, nectarines, cherries and kiwis), other fruit and vegetables, avocados, and prepared foods (including prepared fruit and vegetables, juices, other beverages, and meals and snacks).
•Banana
•Other products and services - includes our ancillary businesses consisting of sales of poultry and meat products, a plastic product business, and third-party freight services.
We market and distribute our products to retail stores, club stores, convenience stores, wholesalers, distributors and foodservice operators in more than 80 countries around the world. North America is our largest market, accounting for 60% of our net sales in 2021. Our other major markets are Europe (which includes Kenya), the Middle East (which includes North Africa) and Asia. Our net sales by region for the year 2021 are depicted in the chart below.
We produce, source, distribute and market a broad array of fresh produce, primarily under the Del Monte® brand, as well as under other proprietary brands, such as UTC® and Rosy®. We also produce, distribute and market prepared fruits and vegetables, juices, beverages and snacks under the Del Monte® brand, as well as other proprietary brands, such as Fruit Express®, Just Juice®, Fruitini® and other regional trademarks in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. We also distribute under the Mann Packing family of brands in North America including Mann™, Mann's Logo™, Arcadian Harvest®, Nourish Bowls®, Broccolini®, Caulilini®, Better Burger Leaf® and Romaleaf®. 
Our distribution centers and fresh-cut facilities address the growing demand from supermarket chains, club stores, convenience stores, foodservice providers, mass merchandisers and independent grocers to provide value-added services, including the preparation of fresh-cut produce, ripening, customized sorting and packing, just-in-time and direct-store-delivery and in-store merchandising and promotional support. Large national and global chains are increasingly choosing fewer suppliers who can serve all of their needs on a national basis. We believe that there is a significant opportunity for a company like ours with a full fresh and fresh-cut produce line, well-recognized brands, a consistent supply of quality produce and a global distribution network to become the preferred supplier to these large retail, convenience store, and foodservice customers. We strive to expand this status by increasing our leading position in fresh-cut produce, expanding our fresh fruit and vegetable business, continuing to grow these value-added products and diversifying our other fresh produce selections. 
Sourcing and Production
A graphic depicting our geographic sales and sourcing operations is shown below.
We source our fresh produce products primarily from Central and South America, North America, and the Philippines and our prepared food products from Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. We also produce, market and distribute certain prepared food products in North America based on our agreement with Del Monte Pacific Limited and its subsidiary Del Monte Foods, Inc. 
Our products are sourced from company-owned operations, through joint venture arrangements and through supply contracts with independent producers. In 2021, 43% of the fresh produce we sold was grown on company-controlled farms and the remaining 57% was acquired primarily through supply contracts with independent growers. Costa Rica is our most significant sourcing location representing approximately 32% of our total sales volume of fresh produce products and where 33% of our property, plant and equipment was located in 2021.
The following table indicates our net sales by product category and the percentage of the total for the last three fiscal years:

Fresh and value-added products 
Our fresh and value-added products segment includes sales of the following product categories:
Fresh-cut produce (fresh-cut fruit and fresh-cut vegetables)

We believe that the fresh-cut produce market continues to be one of the fastest-growing categories in the fresh produce industry, largely due to consumer trends favoring healthy, fresh and conveniently packaged ready-to-eat foods. While packaged salads continue to lead the category of fresh-cut produce sales, the category has expanded significantly to include pineapples, melons, mangoes, grapes, citrus and assorted vegetable produce items that are washed, cut and packaged in a ready-to-use form. Within this market, we believe that there is differentiation between companies active primarily in the packaged salad market and other companies, like us, that can offer a wide variety of value-added conventional and organic fresh-cut fruit and vegetable items.
Our fresh-cut fruit products include Del Monte Gold® Extra Sweet pineapples, melons, grapes, citrus, apples, mangoes, kiwis and other fruit items. With our acquisition of Mann Packing in 2018, we significantly expanded our offering in North America to include a broad variety of fresh and fresh-cut vegetable products. We believe that our experience in this market coupled with our sourcing and logistics capabilities and the Del Monte® brand have enabled us to become a leading supplier of fresh-cut fruit to the supermarket, convenience and club store channels in the United States. 
Our largest selling market for our fresh-cut products is North America, where 71% of our fresh-cut fruit sales and 88% of our fresh-cut vegetable sales were located in 2021. We also sell fresh-cut products in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.
The majority of fresh-cut produce is sold to consumers through retail and club store settings, as well as non-conventional settings such as e-commerce, convenience stores, and airports. We believe that outsourcing by food retailers will increase, particularly as food safety regulations become more stringent and retailers demand more value-added services. We believe that this trend should benefit large branded suppliers like us, who are better positioned to invest in state-of-the-art fresh-cut facilities and food safety systems and to service regional, national and global chains and foodservice operators, as well as supercenters, 
mass merchandisers, club stores and convenience stores. We also believe that large branded suppliers benefit from merchandising, branding and other marketing strategies for fresh-cut products, similar to those used for branded processed food products, which depend substantially on product differentiation.
The fruit we use in our fresh-cut operations are sourced within our integrated system of company-controlled farms and from GAP-certified (good agricultural practices) independent growers. We purchase our vegetables for these purposes from independent growers principally in the United States and Mexico. Our purchase contracts for both fruit and vegetables are typically short-term and vary by produce item. 
Pineapples
We believe that we are the leading marketer of fresh pineapples in the United States and a leading marketer in other markets worldwide, based on internally generated data. Our pineapple net sales in 2021 were primarily concentrated in North America (accounting for 59% of our total sales), followed by Europe (21%), Asia (14%), and the Middle East (6%). 
The premium pineapples, such as our Del Monte Gold® Extra Sweet pineapple, which has an enhanced taste, golden shell color and bright yellow flesh, has replaced other traditional pineapple varieties in popularity and demand. The production and sale of premium pineapples in the market has also led to increased competition. In 2020, we continued our efforts to diversify our product lines with the launch of our proprietary Pinkglow® pineapple which contains higher levels of lycopene, an antioxidant that has been associated with numerous health benefits. In 2021, as a further showcase of our diverse product line in the pineapple space, we relaunched our Honeyglow® pineapples which are left to mature naturally on the plant for a few extra days, ensuring a riper and sweeter product.
Pineapples are grown in tropical and sub-tropical locations. The principal production and procurement areas for our gold pineapples are Costa Rica, the Philippines, and Kenya.
In contrast to bananas, pineapples have a long growing cycle of 18 months, and require re-cultivation after one to two harvests. Pineapple growing requires a higher level of capital investment, as well as greater agricultural expertise as compared to growing bananas. Given the complexity of pineapple cultivation relative to our bananas, a higher percentage of the fresh pineapples we sell (76% by volume in 2021) is produced on company-controlled farms. 
Avocados 
Avocados are one of the fastest growing produce items in the United States. According to a 2021 publication by The Packer, 40% of consumers purchased avocados over the past twelve months. Additionally, the USDA reports that U.S. demand for avocados has increased steadily over the past two decades, with per capita consumption tripling from 2001 to 2018.
Our avocados are sourced principally from Mexico where we have our own sourcing operations and sorting and packing facility, ensuring a consistent supply of high-quality avocados year-round. We also obtain our supply of avocados from independent growers in the United States and Peru. 
Prepared Foods

We have a royalty-free, perpetual license to use the Del Monte® trademark in connection with the production, manufacture, sale and distribution of prepared food, including beverages, in over 100 countries throughout Western, Eastern and Central Europe, Africa, the Middle East and certain Central Asian countries. We can also produce, market and distribute certain prepared food products in North America based on our agreement with Del Monte Pacific. In Europe, Del Monte is a premier prepared food brand with a more than 90-year history associated with fruit-based or fruit-derived products and is the leading brand for canned fruit and pineapple in many Western European markets. The Del Monte® brand has had a presence in the United Kingdom since 1926 and is perceived to be a quality brand with high consumer awareness. The Del Monte® brand has a reputation with both consumers and retailers for value, quality and reliability.
We produce, distribute and market prepared pineapple, peaches, fruit cocktail, pears, tomatoes, fruit juices and other fruits and vegetables. Our prepared pineapple products are primarily sourced from our own facility in Kenya. Our deciduous prepared food products, which include peaches, fruit cocktail, pears and apricots, as well as our tomato products are principally sourced from our own facility in Greece and from independent producers. We also distribute and market beverages, including ambient juices and juice drinks, as well as various snacks. Our prepared food products are sold primarily under the Del Monte® label and under the buyers’ own label for major retailers. We also produce and market industrial products that are composed of fruit that 
has been processed in our production facilities in the form of purees, pulps and concentrates for further processing (juice, yogurt, cake manufacture and pizza) and for sale to the foodservice industry worldwide. In North America, we produce and market an array of prepared vegetable offerings such as vegetable trays with dip and Mann Packing Nourish Bowls®. We expect to continue investing in new product development to increase revenue and maintain our premium price position and market leadership in our prepared foods category.
Banana 
Bananas are the leading internationally traded fresh fruit in terms of volume and dollar sales and one of the best-selling fresh fruits in the United States. According to a 2021 publication by The Packer, bananas were the most popular item in the produce department, purchased by 65% of consumers in the U.S. over the past twelve months.
We believe that we are the third-largest marketer of bananas in the United States and a leading marketer in other markets worldwide, based on internally generated data. Our banana net sales in 2021 were primarily concentrated in North America (accounting for 51% of our total sales), followed by Asia (21%), Europe (18%) and the Middle East (10%). Our ability to provide our customers with a year-round supply of high-quality Del Monte® bananas is important to maintaining our existing customer relationships and attracting new customers. Our position as a volume shipper of bananas has also allowed us to make regular shipments of a wide array of other fresh produce, such as pineapples, melons and plantains, and has enabled us to expand our third-party ocean freight services, thereby reducing our average per-box logistics costs and maintaining higher quality produce with a longer shelf life.
Bananas have a relatively short growing cycle and are grown in tropical locations with humid climates and heavy rainfall, such as Central and South America, the Caribbean, the Philippines and Africa. Bananas are grown throughout the year in these locations, although demand and prices fluctuate based on the relative supply of bananas and the availability of seasonal and alternative fruit.

We produce bananas on company-controlled farms in Costa Rica, Guatemala, the Philippines, Panama and Brazil, and we purchase bananas from independent growers in Guatemala, the Philippines, Ecuador, and Colombia. In 2021, we produced approximately 41% of the banana volume we sold on company-controlled farms, and we purchased the remainder from independent growers. Although our supply contracts are primarily long-term, we also make purchases in the spot market, primarily in Ecuador. In Ecuador and Costa Rica, there are minimum export prices for the sale of bananas which are established and reviewed on a periodic basis by the respective governments.
In the Philippines, we purchase the majority of our bananas through long-term contracts with independent growers. Approximately 72% of our Philippine-sourced bananas are supplied by one grower, representing 10% of the Philippines banana industry volume in 2021. In the Philippines, we have leased approximately 4,200 hectares of land where we have planted approximately 3,500 hectares of bananas for the Asia and the Middle East markets.
In 2017, we executed a contract with the Republic of Panama, which committed us to invest a minimum of $100.0 million over a period of seven years upon the delivery of a minimum of approximately 9,000 net acres of land for leasing within specified timeframes. The investment commitment contemplated the development of the leased land for banana production, including refurbishment of packing plants, buildings and other banana facilities and preparation of banana infrastructure. At the end of 2021, approximately 50% of the total committed land had been received, of which 2,400 acres were under production. The Panamanian government has not delivered the remaining portion of the land to us within the specified timeframes. Based on current conditions, we do not anticipate that the Panamanian government will be able to meet their commitment in the future and therefore we do not anticipate any further capital expenditures related to the undelivered land.
Other Products and Services

Included in our other products and services segment is our Jordanian food business, our third-party freight services business and our third-party plastics and box manufacturing business. Our Jordanian food business includes a vertically integrated poultry business, including poultry farms, hatcheries, a feed mill, a slaughterhouse and a meat processing plant. Our Jordanian poultry business is a leading provider of poultry products to retail stores and foodservice operators in that country. The meat processing operation provides meat products for the Jordanian market and to other Middle East and North African markets.
Our third-party ocean freight business allows us to generate incremental revenue on ships’ return voyages to our product sourcing locations and when space is available on outbound voyages to our major markets, which reduces our overall shipping costs. We expect that the recent addition of our six new refrigerated container vessels will allow us to continue the expansion of 
our third-party ocean freight business by enabling us to ship third-party cargo on both our outbound and inbound voyages, thereby providing a meaningful contribution to our profitability and operating results in future periods.
Our plastics and box manufacturing business produces bins, trays, bags and boxes. The box manufacturing business is intended mainly to satisfy internal packaging requirements. In the case of the plastic manufacturing business, we principally sell these products to third parties and use a portion for our own internal packaging requirements.  
Logistics Operations
We conduct complex logistics operations on a global basis, transporting our products from the countries in which they are grown to the many markets in which they are sold worldwide. Maintaining fresh produce at the appropriate temperature is an important factor in preventing premature ripening and optimizing product quality and freshness. Consistent with our reputation for high-quality fresh produce, we must preserve our fresh produce in a continuous temperature-controlled environment, from the harvest through its distribution.
We have an integrated logistics network, which includes land and sea transportation through a broad range of refrigerated environments in ships, port facilities, containers, trucks and warehouses. Our logistics system is supported by various information systems. Our objective is to maximize use of our logistics network to lower our average per-box logistics cost, while remaining sufficiently flexible to redeploy capacity or shipments to meet fluctuations in demand in our key markets. We believe that our control of the logistics process is a competitive advantage because we are able to continuously monitor and maintain the quality of our produce and ensure timely and regular distribution to customers on a year-round basis. Because logistics costs are also our largest expense other than our cost of products, we devote substantial resources to optimizing our logistics network.
As of the year ended 2021, we transported our fresh produce to markets using our fleet of one chartered and twelve owned ships, and operated four port facilities in the United States. We operated 42 distribution centers, generally with cold storage and banana ripening facilities in our key markets worldwide, including the United States, Canada, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, and Germany. We also operated 25 fresh-cut facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, some of which are located within our distribution centers. In addition, we own or lease other related equipment, including approximately 355 trucks and refrigerated trailers used to transport our fresh produce in the United States. In the Middle East, we own or lease approximately 325 trucks used to deliver fresh produce and prepared food products to customers.
As discussed above, we transport our fresh produce using our fleet of one chartered refrigerated ship and twelve owned ships. We also transport our products to destinations around the world using third-party container lines that cover destinations that we do not service directly with our own fleet. Included in our twelve owned ships are our six new refrigerated container ships, the final two of which we received during fiscal 2021. We believe these fuel-efficient vessels will allow us to continue generating logistics cost savings, expanding our commercial cargo business, and ensuring the freshness and quality of our products. We also operate a fleet of approximately 9,000 refrigerated containers. 
Sales and Marketing
The Del Monte® brand has been used to identify premium produce products for over 125 years and is recognized by consumers worldwide for quality, freshness and reliability. We employ a variety of marketing tools, including but not limited to advertising, public relations and promotions to reinforce our brand equity with consumers and the trade. Depending on the product and market, we also provide technical, logistical and merchandising support aimed at safeguarding the superior quality of our products to the ultimate consumer. Our sales and marketing activities are conducted by our sales force located at our sales offices worldwide and at each of our distribution centers. Our commercial efforts are supported by marketing professionals located in key markets and regional offices. A key element of our sales and marketing strategy is to use our distribution centers and fresh-cut facilities to provide value-added services to our customers. We actively support our customers through technical training in the handling of fresh produce, category management, in-store merchandising support, joint promotional activities, market research and inventory and other logistical support.
The level of marketing investment necessary to support the prepared food business is significantly higher than that required for the fresh produce and fresh-cut fruit and vegetable business. We use a variety of promotional tools to build the Del Monte® brand and engage consumers in key markets in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. In certain European markets, we use distributors to perform product distribution, sales and marketing activities for the prepared food business. Under these distribution agreements, the sales, warehousing, logistics, marketing and promotion functions are all performed by the distributor. This strategy of utilizing independent distributors enables us to reduce distribution, sales and marketing expenses. 
During 2021, one customer, Walmart, Inc. (including its affiliates), accounted for approximately 7% of our total net sales. These sales are reported in our banana and fresh and value-added products segments. No customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in 2021. In 2021, our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 30% of our net sales. 
North America
In 2021, 60% of our net sales were in North America where we have established a highly integrated sales and marketing network that builds on our ability to control transportation and distribution throughout our extensive logistics network. We operate a total of 27 distribution centers and fresh-cut facilities. Our distribution centers have ripening capabilities and/or other value-added services. We also operate four port facilities, which include cold storage capabilities, and own an avocado packing facility in Uruapan, Mexico.
Our logistics network provides us with several sales and marketing advantages. For example, because we are able to maintain the quality of our fresh produce in a continuous temperature-controlled environment, we are under less pressure to fully sell a shipment prior to its arrival at port. This allows us to manage the timing of our sales to optimize our margins. Our ability to off-load shipments for cold storage and distribution throughout our network also improves ship utilization by minimizing in-port docking time. Our logistics network also allows us to manage our inventory among distribution centers to effectively respond to changes in customer demand. 
We have sales professionals in locations throughout the United States and Canada. We sell to leading grocery stores and other retail chains, wholesalers, mass merchandisers, supercenters, foodservice operators, club stores, convenience stores and distributors in North America. These large customers typically take delivery of our products at the port facilities, which we refer to as FOB delivery. We also service these customers, as well as an increasing number of smaller regional chains and independent grocers, through our distribution centers.
Europe
In 2021, 16% of our net sales were in Europe where we distribute our fresh produce and prepared food products. Our fresh produce products are distributed to leading retail chains, smaller regional customers as well as to wholesalers and distributors through direct sales and distribution centers.  In the United Kingdom, we have a sales and marketing office in Staines, England and operate a fresh-cut facility in Wisbech, England. In Germany, we operate a distribution center in the Frankfurt area. In France, since late 2021, we have outsourced our fresh-cut production and banana ripening activities to third-parties, while our sales and marketing function is performed internally. In the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Poland, we have sales and marketing entities that perform direct sales of our fresh produce products. 
Our prepared food products are distributed through independent distributors throughout most of Europe. In the United Kingdom, our prepared food products are distributed using a combination of both independent distributors and our own marketing entity. Since the beginning of 2021, our prepared food activity in Germany has been performed via direct sales to the retail channel through our own sales and marketing entity. In Russia, we have a sales and marketing office for our prepared food products.
Middle East and North Africa
In 2021, 10% of our net sales were in the Middle East and North Africa. We distribute our products through independent distributors and company-operated distribution facilities. 
Our leased distribution/manufacturing center in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (“UAE”) is a state-of-the-art facility with just-in-time delivery capabilities that includes fresh-cut fruit and vegetable operations, an ultra-fresh juice manufacturing operation and prepared food distribution. In Saudi Arabia, through our 60%-owned joint venture, we own two distribution centers with banana ripening, cold storage facilities, fresh-cut fruit, vegetable and salad operations, and prepared food manufacturing of frozen potatoes and freshly prepared sandwiches. One of the distribution centers is located in Riyadh, the capital city of Saudi Arabia, and the other distribution center is located in Jeddah, the second largest city in the country. These strategically located distribution centers distribute our fresh produce and prepared food products to these growing markets. In the UAE and in Saudi Arabia, we also distribute our products using our own innovative retail concept through our Food and Beverage (F&B) stores. These F&B stores are small retail kiosks selling our fresh-cut produce, juice and other prepared food products and are strategically located in airports, schools, hospitals and inside hyper-markets. 
In Jordan, we own a vertically integrated poultry business including poultry farms, hatcheries, feed mill, slaughterhouse and a meat processing plant. We are a leading provider of poultry products to retail stores and foodservice operators in that country. In Jordan, we also own a meat processing operation that provides meat products for the local market and for export to other Middle East and North African markets. As part of our vertical integration and expansion strategy in this region, we developed a 10 hectare ultra-modern hydroponic greenhouse in Jordan to supply lettuce to our fresh-cut facilities and we have one F&B store in this country.
In Qatar, we have a sales and marketing office to serve the expanding brand presence in the country and an F&B store located at the Doha airport. In Turkey, our sales office located in Mersin is responsible for sourcing various types of fruit serving our units across the region in addition to selling and distributing a range of prepared food products to distributors. We have an F&B store in Kuwait in addition to a leased facility to service the Kuwaiti market with our fresh produce products and fresh-cut fruit, fresh-cut vegetables and salads. In Tunisia, we have an office giving us presence in the North Africa region, which imports fresh produce products to sell in the local market. We also have an office in Morocco, which distributes our products locally and exports locally-sourced fresh produce, allowing us to further expand our coverage in the North Africa Region. We believe that the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asian countries represent an area for sales growth and development of our fresh and prepared food products. Utilizing our extensive knowledge of this region, we plan to continue capitalizing on this opportunity with increased focus in these markets.
Asia

In 2021, 12% of our net sales were in Asia. We distribute our products in Asia through direct marketing and large distributors. Our principal markets in this region are Japan, South Korea, mainland China and Hong Kong. In Japan, we distributed 100% of the products we sold in 2021 through our own direct sales and marketing organization and we operate three fresh-cut facilities. Our products are distributed from four distribution centers located at strategic ports in Japan, which include cold storage.
We engage in direct sales and marketing activities in South Korea and Hong Kong. In other Asian markets, including mainland China, we sell to local distributors. We have one distribution center and banana ripening facility in Hong Kong. In South Korea, we have three distribution centers that utilize state-of-the art ripening technology which increase our ability to offer value-added services to our customers. In South Korea, we also operate a fresh-cut fruit and vegetable facility from which we supply major foodservice customers.
Competition

The global fresh produce industry is a highly competitive sector, and the effect of competition is intensified because of the perishable nature of the products. We compete based on a variety of factors, including price, overall product quality, brand recognition and customer loyalty, reliability and consistency, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy evolving consumer preferences. Our sales are also affected by the availability of seasonal and alternative produce. While historically our main competitors have been multinational banana and pineapple producers, our diversified range of product offerings has resulted in additional competition from a variety of companies. These companies include local and regional producers and distributors in each of our fresh produce and fresh-cut product categories.
The extent of competition varies by product. In the banana market, we continue to face competition from a limited number of large multinational companies. At times, particularly when demand is greater than supply, we also face competition from a large number of relatively small banana producers. Unlike the pineapple market, there are few barriers to entry into the banana market. Supplies of bananas can be increased relatively quickly due to bananas having a short growing cycle and the limited capital investment required for banana growing. As a result of changes in supply and demand, plus seasonal factors, banana prices fluctuate significantly.
In the pineapple category, we believe that the high degree of capital investment and cultivation expertise required, as well as the longer length of the growing cycle, makes it relatively difficult to enter the market. Our primary competitors in this category are large multinational producers, as well as smaller exporters and importers. Our profitability has depended significantly on the sale of our Del Monte Gold® Extra Sweet pineapples.
The fresh-cut produce market is highly fragmented, and we compete with a wide variety of local and regional distributors of branded and unbranded fresh-cut produce and, in the case of certain fresh-cut vegetables, a small number of large, branded producers and distributors. However, we believe that our principal competitive opportunity is to capitalize on the growing trend of retail chains and independent grocers to outsource their own on-premises fresh-cut operations. We believe that our sales strategy, which emphasizes not only our existing sources of fresh produce, but also a full range of value-added services, strict compliance with food safety standards and our national distribution capability, positions us to increase our share of this market.

The prepared food products market is mature and characterized by high levels of competition and consumer awareness. Consumer choices are driven by price and/or quality. Large retailers with their “buyers own label” (“BOL”) products appeal to price-conscious consumers, while brand names are the key differentiator for quality-focused consumers. In the prepared food markets in Europe, Africa, North America, and the Middle East, we compete with various local producers, large retailers with their BOL products, and large international branded companies. It is in the branded section that our prepared food products, specifically, canned fruit and pineapple in many European countries, hold a leading position in these markets. The mature state of the market in Western Europe, together with the strength and sophistication of the large retailers there, account in part for the increasing presence of BOL products in many food and beverage categories. In order to reduce our costs and increase our competitiveness in the prepared foods business, particularly in Europe, we use distributors in certain key European markets to perform product distribution and sales and marketing activities. Under these arrangements, the sales, warehousing, logistics, marketing and promotion functions are all performed by the distributor.
Quality Assurance

To ensure the consistent high quality of our products, we have quality assurance operations placed throughout our global operations under the direction of our corporate quality assurance team. This quality assurance team maintains and enforces detailed quality specifications for all our products so that they meet or exceed our high quality standards and any applicable regulatory requirements. Our specifications require extensive sampling of our fresh produce at each stage of the production and distribution process using external appearance, internal quality, size, color, porosity, translucency, sweetness and other criteria. Our goal is that only fresh produce meeting our stringent quality specifications is sold under the Del Monte® brand.

We are able to maintain the high quality of our products by growing a substantial portion of our own produce and working closely with our independent growers. We insist that all produce supplied by our independent growers meet the same stringent quality requirements as the produce grown on our farms. Accordingly, we monitor our independent growers to ensure that their produce will meet our agricultural and quality control standards, offer technical assistance on certain aspects of production and packing and, in some cases, manage the farms. The quality assurance process begins on the farms and continues as harvested products enter our packing facilities. Where appropriate, we cool the fresh produce at our packing facilities to maximize quality and optimize shelf life. 
As an indication of our worldwide commitment to quality, food safety, and sustainability, many of our operations are third party certified in globally recognized standards developed for the safe and sustainable production and distribution of quality foods.  These standards include the International Organization for Standardization’s ISO 22000 and the Global Food Safety (GFS) Initiative benchmarked standards of Primus GFS, Global G.A.P, and we are in compliance with all components of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Food Safety Modernization Act. All of our operations that produce or handle high risk foods (tomatoes, melons or leafy greens) apply Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) principles. HACCP is a management system in which food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of biological, chemical and physical hazard from raw material production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product. Our certification also includes SCS Global Services’ Sustainably Grown Certified and the Sustainable Agriculture Network’s Rain Forest Alliance for sustainable agriculture and food production. Additionally, our Costa Rica Banana operation has been certified as Carbon Neutral by SCS Global Services since 2015, and our Costa Rica pineapple operation was recently certified as well. Taken together, these certifications reflect our commitment to quality and the strictest standards of food safety. 
Government Regulation
As a producer and distributor of food products, we are subject to extensive government laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where our produce is grown, where our facilities are located and where our products are distributed. We have internal policies and procedures to comply with the most stringent regulations applicable to our products, as well as a technical staff to monitor pesticide usage and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We believe we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations.
The countries in which we market a material amount of our products are the United States, the countries of the EU, Japan, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia. The government regulations we are subject to include:

•sanitary regulations, particularly in the United States and the EU;

•regulations governing pesticide use in all source countries and residue standards in all market countries, particularly in the United States, Germany, Japan and South Korea; 
•ongoing Endocrine Disruptor Assessment programs in the EU and United States which may potentially impact availability, use and residue tolerance of some pesticides; and
•regulations governing safety, traceability, packaging, and labeling, particularly in the United States where we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Food Safety Modernization Act, and in the EU, where food safety policy is governed by the Farm to Fork Strategy which regulates food safety at all stages of the production and distribution process for all food products marketed within the EU, whether produced within the EU or imported from other countries. For further information about these regulations, please refer to the discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors, “We are subject to regulations concerning food safety and protection of health and the environment.”

We believe there has been an increasing emphasis on food safety issues on the part of consumers, as well as retailers, wholesalers, distributors and foodservice operators, which could result in our business and operations being subject to increasingly stringent food safety regulations or guidelines.
European Union Banana Import Regulations
In December 2010, the EU ratified an agreement with certain Latin America banana exporting countries in which the EU gradually reduced import tariffs on bananas from Latin America except for countries under Free Trade Agreements (FTA's). Countries under FTA's that signed bilateral agreements with the EU in 2012 benefited from an accelerated but gradual reduction of import duties. Our Colombia and Central America-sourced bananas benefit from this FTA agreement. However, we cannot predict the impact of further changes to the banana import tariffs or new quotas on the EU banana market. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact to banana import tariffs that may result from the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU.
Environmental Proceedings

The management, use and disposal of some chemicals and pesticides are inherent aspects of our production operations. These activities and other aspects of production are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, depending upon the country of operation. In addition, in some countries of operation, environmental laws can require the investigation and, if necessary, remediation of contamination related to past or current operations. We are not a party to any dispute or legal proceeding relating to environmental matters where we believe that the risk associated with the dispute or legal proceeding would be material, except as described in Item 3.  Legal Proceedings and Note 15, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
In 1980, elevated levels of certain chemicals were detected in the soil and ground-water at a plantation leased by one of our U.S. subsidiaries in Oahu, Hawaii. For further information, See Item 3.  Legal Proceedings and Note 15, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, Etc.
Our research and development programs have led to improvements in agricultural and growing practices, as well as product packaging and technology. These programs are directed mainly at reducing the cost and risk of pesticides, using natural biological agents to control pests and diseases, testing new varieties of our principal fruit varieties for improved crop yield and resistance to diseases, and improving post-harvest handling. We have been seeking to increase the productivity of low-grade soils for improved banana growth and experimenting with various other types of fresh produce. Our research and development efforts are conducted by our staff of professionals and include studies conducted in laboratories, as well as on-site field analysis and experiments. We have research teams directing or actively involved in the development of new fruit varieties in the United States, Costa Rica, and Brazil.
Some of the research and development projects include:
•the development of the Del Monte Gold® Extra Sweet pineapple and other pineapple and melon varieties, including our proprietary Pinkglow® pineapple and the recently patented Vintage Ruby™ pineapple
•improved irrigation methods and soil preparation for melon planting 

In addition, during fiscal 2021, we announced a partnership with Queensland University of Technology, located in Brisbane, Australia, to lead innovation toward the development of disease-resistant bananas. The partnership will help to develop bananas that are resistant to Tropical Race 4 (TR4), a serious vascular crop disease that affects one of our principal products, the Cavendish variety of bananas.

Seasonality

Due to seasonal sales price fluctuations, we have historically realized a greater portion of our net sales and of our gross profit during the first two calendar quarters of the year. The sales price of any fresh produce item fluctuates throughout the year due to the supply of and demand for that particular item, as well as the pricing and availability of other fresh produce items, many of which are seasonal in nature. For example, the production of bananas is continuous throughout the year and production is usually higher in the second half of the year, when the demand for bananas varies because of the availability of other fruit. As a result, demand for bananas is seasonal and generally results in higher sales prices during the first six months of the calendar year. We make most of our sales of non-tropical fruit from October to May.
These seasonal fluctuations are illustrated in the table below, which presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for the periods indicated. Specifically in 2020, net sales and gross profit for most products were negatively impacted, mainly in the second and third quarter, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, gross profit was negatively impacted by inflationary and cost pressures, most notably in the third quarter.

Human Capital Management
We believe in nurturing people, from consumers eating our products to our employees, suppliers, customers and the communities in which we live and work. 
Employees

Our employees are our greatest asset and are directly responsible for our success in delivering fresh, quality products to consumers. Our current workforce is comprised of approximately 10,483 full-time, salaried employees and 29,572 full-time, hourly employees. Additionally, we employ over 9,522 seasonal, hourly employees, who enable us to pack our in-season fruits and vegetables. Approximately 99% of our workforce is employed in production locations. We provide our employees with competitive fixed and/or variable pay, and for eligible employees, we currently provide access to health and retirement benefits. In each of our regions, we work with local officials to calculate fair wages for our team members. We are competitive with local practices; on average, we pay above minimum wage at our farms in Central America, Kenya, and the Philippines.
Diversity and Inclusion
We strive to foster a culture of diversity and inclusion (“D&I”) so all employees feel respected and no employee feels discriminated against. We are proud of the diversity throughout our organization and especially in our leadership team, of which 25% identify as Hispanic, 17% identify as Black, 8% identify as Native American, 25% identify as Caucasian and 25% identify as Middle Eastern. We embrace diversity throughout our company as we have employees across six different generations and many different backgrounds. In 2019, we launched an internal diversity audit to better understand diversity, equity and inclusion within our organization. As a result of feedback from our 2020 diversity survey, in 2021, we added two new female members to our board of directors. During 2021, a formal council comprised of senior leadership worked to connect our D&I efforts with our overall business strategy to communicate our goals, develop mechanisms to achieve those goals and track our progress. We believe a diverse workforce fosters innovation and cultivates an environment of unique perspectives. As a result, diversity and inclusion help us meet the needs of our customers around the world. 
Engagement and Opportunities
Evolving our culture to increase employee engagement and productivity is a primary focus of our strategic plan as we believe an engaged workforce leads to a more innovative, productive and profitable company. Our employees are supported with training and development opportunities to pursue their careers and support compliance with our policies. We also utilize a centralized employee intranet to reach out to employees and allow them to stay connected, remain informed and communicate their thoughts and values.
Health
We support the health and well-being of our employees by offering health care benefits. While these benefits vary across our different regions, we are competitive with local practices. We also take a proactive approach to the health and well-being of our communities by contributing to the development of health services and infrastructure. We also aim to raise awareness of the importance of good health. In total, we fund 45 clinics and medical centers globally, where we provide medical and health treatments including vaccines, check-up appointments and more. We also support many local organizations and initiatives that promote healthy and active lifestyles, and sponsor local sports teams and organizations throughout our regions. 
COVID-19 caused uncertainty and challenges across the globe. As a food producer and distributor, ensuring continuity of supply while protecting the health and safety of our team members and workers throughout our supply chain was our priority. In response to the pandemic, we implemented extensive safety programs to protect our employees from COVID-19. To help address food insecurity caused by the pandemic, we significantly increased our usual efforts to donate food and provide grants to communities in need. In 2021, we continued making donations of produce to support families in North America and Central America. We are dedicated to helping our workforce, consumers, communities and customers persevere through these tough times.
Safety
We are committed to building a culture of safety with the goal of zero incidents. We enforce our Supplier Code of Conduct so that our suppliers uphold these standards and eliminate labor violations in our supply chain. We require that our key third-party suppliers are certified against Global Food and Safety Initiative benchmarked standards or other standards needed to support the 
safety of their products. We are also supporting innovations to enhance soils, crop yields and resiliency to strengthen our farmers’ livelihoods.
Community Outreach
In our communities around the world, we create more than just jobs; we increase access to healthcare and education, help develop infrastructure, contribute to reducing food insecurity and supporting resiliency and recovery when natural disasters occur. We recognize that each community has unique needs, challenges and cultures, so we work with these communities individually through local organizations and governments, to help develop initiatives that address some of their biggest challenges. Our goal for these programs is to support and foster lasting change. Although we prioritize a “bottom-up” approach that gives our operating regions the responsibility for responding to the specific issues of local concern, we do have overarching themes to our support access to healthcare, education, infrastructure development and clean water and disaster relief.
Globally, we launch and support a variety of projects each year, from providing clean water, to funding schools, to planting trees. We work together with our team members and communities to tackle the issues they face in each of the regions we are proud to call home and are committed to doing all that we can to preserve, protect and grow programs and infrastructure that help them thrive. Our efforts, to date, include:
•Funding 45 clinics and medical centers globally, where we attend to around 50,000 patients annually;
•Supporting 23,000 students and adult learners with educational opportunities since 2018;
•Aiding in sanitation and health efforts across the globe in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;
•Partnering with the United Nations to advance women’s health in Kenya; and
•Planting and donating more than 1 million trees in in our operations and our communities. 
We seek to continue to grow, support and evolve these efforts in a way that meets the changing needs of our individual communities around the world.
Workforce Governance
Our Board of Directors currently oversees all human capital resources. Our Governance Committee currently oversees our policies and programs related to sustainability, risk management, corporate social responsibility and the environment. Additionally, our Compensation Committee is dedicated to carrying out incentive programs and working with our employees to strategically align talent within the Company. Within our Compensation Committee, our Human Resources officer is responsible for advising and providing insight to best practices regarding human resource issues.
