Item 1. Business. 
Overview
e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (“e.l.f. Beauty” and together with our subsidiaries, the “Company,” or “we”) is a multi-brand beauty company that offers inclusive, accessible, clean and cruelty-free cosmetics and skincare products.
•WHO WE ARE. We are bold disruptors with a kind heart. We’re disrupting traditional beauty boundaries while leading with empathy, intention and an innate desire to empower people. 
•OUR MISSION. We build brands that disrupt industry norms, shape culture and connect communities through positivity, inclusivity and accessibility. 
•OUR PURPOSE. We stand with every eye, lip, face and paw. 
We believe our ability to deliver 100% cruelty-free, clean, premium-quality products at accessible prices with broad appeal differentiates us in the beauty industry. We believe the combination of our innovation engine, core value proposition, digitally-led strategy, as well as our world-class team’s ability to execute with speed has positioned us well to navigate a rapidly changing landscape in beauty. 
Our Brands
Our family of brands includes e.l.f. Cosmetics, e.l.f. SKIN, Well People and Keys Soulcare. Our brands are available online and across leading beauty, mass-market and clean-beauty specialty retailers. We have strong relationships with our retail partners such as Walmart, Target, Ulta Beauty and other leading retailers that have enabled us to expand distribution both domestically and internationally.
Each of our brands is positioned to touch diverse consumer cohorts at different price points. Each brand has accessible pricing relative to its competitive set and furthers our mission of leading with positivity, inclusivity and accessibility.

e.l.f. Cosmetics | Since 2004, e.l.f. Cosmetics has made the best of beauty accessible to every eye, lip and face. e.l.f. makes high-quality, prestige-inspired cosmetics at an extraordinary value and is proud to be 100% vegan, clean and cruelty-free. 
e.l.f. SKIN | Winning in skin the clean + kind way. Ingredient focused skincare for every eye, lip, face and skin type. e.l.f. SKIN makes innovative formulas at an extraordinary value, always 100% vegan, clean and cruelty-free. 
Well People | A clean beauty pioneer with 40 EWG VERIFIED™ products, Well People has raised the standard for high-performing, plant-powered and cruelty-free beauty and skincare since 2008. Founded on the principles of being derm-developed, super-clean, and planet minded, Well People is committed to inspiring wellness and mindful living. 
Keys Soulcare | Created by Alicia Keys and inspired by her own skincare journey and love of ancient beauty rituals, Keys Soulcare goes beyond skincare to truly care for the whole self - body, mind, and spirit. With an inclusive point of view, Keys Soulcare brings a new meaning to beauty and honors rituals through its line of dermatologist-developed, clean and cruelty-free offerings.

100% cruelty-free: We do not conduct or tolerate any tests on animals, nor do we use any ingredients that are tested on animals in any of our products. Each of our brands is certified by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) as “Global Animal Test-Free”, a credential given to companies and brands who have verified that their own facilities and their suppliers do not conduct, commission, pay for, or allow any tests on animals for their ingredients, formulations, or finished products. e.l.f. Cosmetics is also certified by PETA as “Global Animal Test-Free and Vegan”, which recognizes companies and brands that not only ban animal tests but also refuse to use any animal-derived ingredients, such as honey, beeswax, or carmine in products.
Clean ingredients: Our products are formulated with ingredients that have the health and safety of our consumers in mind. All products are formulated to comply with Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") and European Union Cosmetic Regulation restrictions covering over 1,600 ingredients including parabens, phthalates, sulfates, formaldehyde, nonylphenol ethoxylates, triclosan, triclocarban, toluene, coal tar, lead, mercury, acrylamide and hydroquinone as well as other substances. Additionally, Well People's product-line includes 40 EWG VERIFIED™ products, a leading standard of “clean and healthy” in the beauty space. 
Marketing & Digital
We deploy a consumer-centric marketing model. We build brand equity and drive traffic to our national retailer partners and to our own e-commerce websites and mobile applications primarily through digital and social media, as compared to legacy beauty brands that often seek to engage consumers through traditional media such as magazines, newspapers and television. Total expenses for marketing and digital in the year ended March 31, 2022 were $63.2 million, approximately 16% of our net sales.
Our consumers have been our best advocates through strong word of mouth. Many of our consumers are active in social media, write reviews of our products online and generate content on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube and other social media platforms. 
Innovation
We believe innovation is key to our success and that we are a leader in the industry in speed and first to mass product introductions. We have built an innovation capability that can progress a new, high-quality product from concept to online launch in as few as 13 weeks and approximately 20 weeks on average. We leverage multiple sources of inspiration to develop our new product ideas, including global trend assessments, supplier and industry research, strategic customer input and consumer feedback and insights. 
Our innovation strategy is underpinned by four key pillars:
•Holy Grails. “Holy grails” are beauty products that deliver premium quality at unbelievable prices with broad appeal. As consumers are increasingly savvy and knowledgeable about trends in the prestige market, they look for ways to get the best of beauty at an accessible price. Examples of our “holy grails” include the e.l.f. Cosmetics Poreless Putty Primer at $10 versus a comparable prestige primer at $52, the e.l.f. Cosmetics 16HR Camo Concealer at $7 versus a comparable prestige concealer at $30, and the Well People Expressionist Pro Mascara at $20 versus a comparable clean prestige mascara at $28.
•Core Improvement. We consistently evaluate our core offerings to develop new products or improve quality based on category trends, consumer feedback, and other market intelligence. We launch trend-inspired, core expansion products that augment our assortment and deliver extraordinary value across price points. We also evaluate quality improvement opportunities within our product assortment, such as reformulating existing products with cleaner ingredients. 
•Adjacencies. We believe that we can reapply our model to continue to launch products into adjacent product categories outside of cosmetics. For example, in October 2021, Well People launched its first product collection in the skincare category, featuring five products with dermatologist-developed formulas that support skin health and are infused with plant-powered ingredients. In May 2021, Keys Soulcare launched three product offerings in the body care category, adding to the brand's dermatologist-developed, clean and cruelty free skincare offerings. 
•Collaborations & Collections. We utilize collaborations and collections to build brand awareness and showcase our brands’ abilities to connect with, surprise and delight consumers while creating buzz-generating moments. For example, in March 2022, e.l.f. Cosmetics launched a collaboration with Dunkin' on a limited edition makeup collection. We also utilize exclusive collections with our national retailers. For example, in January 2022, e.l.f. Cosmetics launched a limited edition Cookies ‘N’ Dreams collection exclusively at Walmart in the United States, at Superdrug in the United Kingdom, and at Douglas in Italy and the Netherlands. 
Markets and Competition
We operate across beauty categories including face makeup, eye makeup, lip products, nail products, cosmetics sets/kits, beauty tools and accessories, facial skincare, and eye skincare products. Color cosmetics and skincare products are broadly sold through food, drug and mass channels, as well as through department stores and direct and specialty channels.
The beauty industry is relatively concentrated, with a significant portion of retail sales in the United States generated by brands owned by a few large multinational companies, such as L’Oreal, Estee Lauder, Coty, Revlon, Shiseido, Johnson & Johnson, and Procter & Gamble. These large multinational companies typically own multiple brands. In addition to the traditional brands against which we compete, small independent companies continue to enter the market with new brands and customized product offerings.
Distribution 
We employ an omni-channel distribution strategy and sell our products online through our own direct e-commerce channels, and with national retailers in the United States, as well as internationally. Our main channels of distribution are described below.
•National retailers.    We sell our products in the United States primarily in the mass, drug store, food and specialty retail channels.
•e-commerce.   Our e-commerce platforms are an important component of our engagement and innovation model. Our roots as an e-commerce company and our digital engagement model drive conversion on our e-commerce websites and our mobile applications, where we sell our full product offerings.
•International.    Our products are also sold in a number of international markets, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Germany.
Customers
Along with our direct e-commerce channels, we have strong relationships with our retail partners such as Walmart, Target, Ulta Beauty and other leading retailers that have enabled us to expand distribution both domestically and internationally.
Walmart, Target and Ulta Beauty accounted for 26%, 23% and 12%, respectively, of our net sales in the year ended March 31, 2022. No other individual customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in the year ended March 31, 2022. We expect that Walmart, Target and Ulta Beauty along with small number of other customers will, in the aggregate, continue to account for a large portion of our net sales in the future. 
As is customary in the industry, none of our customers is under any obligation to continue purchasing products from us in the future.
For more information regarding customer concentration, see Part II, Item 7 “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this report under the heading “Overview.”
Supply Chain
We have developed a scalable, asset-light supply chain centered on speed to market and high-quality at low cost. Substantially all of our products are sourced and manufactured in China through close collaboration with a network of third-party manufacturers. We have ample manufacturing capacity as well as redundant capabilities in the event that one or more suppliers cannot meet our needs. Our broad supply base gives us the ability to fulfill our product requirements and remain cost competitive.
We work closely with our suppliers on new product innovation and quality. Our China-based sourcing, quality and innovation teams work with their U.S.-based counterparts to deliver ongoing product quality, innovation and cost savings. We are not overly dependent on any single raw material. The raw materials used in our products are broadly available and have regular quality testing for ingredient integrity. 
We operate two main distribution centers: one in Ontario, California, which mainly serves our national retail customers, and one in Columbus, Ohio, which mainly services our e-commerce consumers. We have invested capital in picking, packaging, scanning, and conveying technology to more fully automate our processes. Our Ontario and Columbus distribution centers are both operated by a leading third-party logistics provider. For our international operations, we utilize third-party logistics providers in Canada and the United Kingdom to distribute to certain international customers and distributors.
Employees and Human Capital Management
We are led by our purpose—we stand with every eye, lip, face and paw—and our employees are at the core of our business strategy. As of March 31, 2022, we had 303 full-time employees (224 in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, and 79 in China).
Culture and Commitments
By standing with every eye, lip, face and paw, we are committed to creating a culture internally—and in the world around us—where all individuals are encouraged to express their truest selves, are empowered to succeed, and where we strive to do the right thing for people, the planet and our furry friends. We are committed to:
• Encourage Self Expression. We celebrate diversity and make the best of beauty accessible. 
• Empower Others. We provide equal opportunities for growth and success. 
• Embody Our Ethics. We strive to do the right thing for all people, the planet and our furry friends. 
Encourage Self Expression: Promoting a Culture of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion and believe it is important that our team reflects the diverse consumers we serve. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion starts at the top with a highly skilled and diverse Board of Directors. We are proud to be one of only seven public companies in the U.S. with a Board of Directors that has over 55% women and over 20% Black or African American representation (out of over 4,800 public companies). 
We are proud of our workforce demographics and are committed to ensuring that appropriate levels of diversity – including but not limited to gender, race, sexual orientation, national origin, ability, and age – are represented across our entire team. We promote diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels of our workforce, and our senior leadership team owns and is responsible for our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and programs. We are committed to increasing the representation of women and minorities in our workforce. 
The following table provides certain statistics of our team as of April 2022:

 | Board of Directors | Senior Leadership(1) | All Employees(2)
Gender | | | 
Female | 56% | 43% | 81% 
Male | 44% | 57% | 19%

(1) | Senior Leadership includes our Executive Officers and the Vice President, General Manager of our China operations. 
(2) | Includes our employees in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, where over 70% of our workforce is located.

We believe that to drive change there must be continuous education, learning and sharing. We offer Unconscious Bias Training and a Behaviors of Inclusion Course to all of our employees, so that our employees learn the psychology of unconscious bias and its impact at work and practice behaviors of inclusion. We host open forums with our senior leadership to share and encourage uncomfortable conversations. Additionally, we regularly host education events for our employees to lean into cultural moments, such as Black History Month; International Women’s Month; Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month; Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) Pride Month; and LatinX Heritage Month.
Empower Others: Supporting the Full Potential of Our Employees
Our talented employees are at the core of our business strategy. We place a high priority on attracting, recruiting, developing and retaining diverse global talent. Our benefits and programs are designed to support the total well-being and promote the full potential of our employees. 
With regards to compensation, we take a “one-team” approach. All full-time employees receive a base salary, are bonus eligible under the same bonus plan tied to our financial performance, and receive an equity award. We believe this approach – which applies across all employee levels and geographies – is unique in the beauty industry and contributes to our success in hiring and retaining top talent and driving business results.
In the United States, where over 70% of our workforce is located, the benefits for our full-time employees include, among other things: 
•Financial benefits, including competitive compensation as well as retirement savings plans and commuter benefits;
•Healthcare benefits including flexible spending accounts, disability and life insurance;
•Family support and flexibility benefits including up to 20 weeks of parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child as well as the placement of a foster child, as well as fertility and adoption support;
•Wellness and time off programs including an employee assistance program, access to wellness coaches and paid time off;
•Community impact programs including volunteer time off and donation matching programs; 
•Education and career development programs including tuition reimbursement, high performance teamwork coaching, as well as ongoing learning and training opportunities; and
•Other benefits, such as “Pawternity Leave” for the adoption of a shelter animal.
Outside of the United States, we provide similarly competitive benefit packages to those offered to our United States employees and tailored to market-specific practices.
Embody Our Ethics: Doing the Right Thing for All People, the Planet and Our Furry Friends
All People
We proudly support human rights and individual expression and freedom. As such, we treat all employees with respect, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, religion, abilities or sexual orientation. We also expect our suppliers and partners to observe these principles when providing products and services to us.
The Planet
We are committed to minimizing our environmental impact while providing our consumers with premium-quality beauty products. In the year ended March 31, 2022, we celebrated a significant milestone on our sustainability journey – eliminating approximately one million pounds of packaging waste since the inception of "Project Unicorn". Project Unicorn was launched in 2019 to elevate e.l.f. Cosmetics’ product assortment, presentation, and navigation on-shelf, and resulted in a significant streamlining in our product packaging footprint. The elimination of packaging waste was achieved by removing secondary cartons, vacuum formed trays and paper insert cards, slimming down secondary packaging, and designing a patented approach to display product on shelf. 
Our Furry Friends
We are proud to be a 100% cruelty-free company. We do not conduct or tolerate any tests on animals, nor do we use any ingredients that are tested on animals in any of our products. Each of our brands is certified by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) as “Global Animal Test-Free”, a credential given to companies and brands who have verified that their own facilities and their suppliers do not conduct, commission, pay for, or allow any tests on animals for their ingredients, formulations, or finished products. 
Seasonality
Our results of operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters typically being higher than in the first and second fiscal quarters. The higher net sales in our third and fourth fiscal quarters are largely attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday season and customer shelf reset activity, respectively. Lower holiday purchases or shifts in customer shelf reset activity could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. To support anticipated higher sales during the third and fourth fiscal quarters, we make investments in working capital to ensure inventory levels can support demand. Fluctuations throughout the year are also driven by the timing of product restocking or rearrangement by our major retail customers as well as expansion into new retail customers. Because a limited number of our retail customers account for a large percentage of our net sales, a change in the order pattern of one or more of our large retail customers could cause a significant fluctuation of our quarterly results or impact our liquidity.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our primary trademarks include “e.l.f.,” “e.l.f. eyes lips face,” “Well People,” and “Keys Soulcare” all of which are registered or have registrations pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for our goods and services of primary interest. These trademarks are also registered or have registrations pending in various foreign countries in which we operate. We also have other trademark registrations and pending trademark applications for product names and tag lines. Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce the distinctiveness of our brands and our consumers’ perception of our products. In addition to trademark protection, we own U.S. Design Patents covering packaging, make-up tools and brush handle shapes and we own numerous domain names, including the domain names of our e-commerce websites. We also rely on and use commercially reasonable measures to protect our unpatented proprietary technology, which includes our expertise and product formulations, continuing innovation and other know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Government Regulation
We and our products are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations, including regulation in the United States by the FDA, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”), the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), and regulations outside of the United States by Health Canada and the European Commission, among others. These laws and regulations principally relate to the ingredients, proper labeling, advertising, packaging, marketing, manufacture, safety, shipment and disposal of our products. Further, as the vast majority of our products are imported from overseas manufacturers, we are subject to Customs Border Patrol clearance regulations prior to goods being released into the United States market.
In the Unites States, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), defines cosmetics as articles or components of articles intended for application to the human body to cleanse, beautify, promote attractiveness, or alter the appearance, with the exception of soap. The labeling of cosmetic products is subject to the requirements of the FDCA, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act and other FDA regulations. Cosmetics are not subject to pre-market approval by the FDA; however, certain ingredients, such as color additives, must be pre-approved for the specific intended use of the product and are subject to certain restrictions on their use. If a company has not adequately substantiated the safety of its products or ingredients by, for example, performing appropriate toxicological tests or relying on already available toxicological test data, then a specific warning label is required. The FDA may, by regulation, require other warning statements on certain cosmetic products for specified hazards associated with such products. FDA regulations also prohibit or otherwise restrict the use of certain types of ingredients in cosmetic products.
In addition, the FDA requires that cosmetic labeling and claims be truthful and not misleading. Moreover, cosmetics may not be marketed or labeled for their use in treating, preventing, mitigating, or curing disease or other conditions or in affecting the structure or function of the body, as such claims would render the products to be a drug and subject to regulation as a drug. The FDA has issued warning letters to cosmetic companies alleging improper drug claims regarding their cosmetic products. In addition to FDA requirements, the FTC as well as state consumer protection laws and regulations can subject a cosmetics company to a range of requirements and theories of liability, including similar standards regarding false and misleading product claims, under which FTC or state enforcement or class-action lawsuits may be brought.
In the U.S., the FDA has not promulgated regulations establishing Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMPs”) for cosmetics. However, FDA’s draft guidance on cosmetic GMPs, most recently updated in June 2013, provides recommendations related to process documentation, recordkeeping, building and facility design, equipment maintenance and personnel, and compliance with these recommendations can reduce the risk that FDA finds such products have been rendered adulterated or misbranded in violation of applicable law. FDA also recommends that manufacturers maintain product complaint and recall files and voluntarily report adverse events to the agency. The FDA monitors compliance of cosmetic products through market surveillance and inspection of cosmetic manufacturers and distributors to ensure that the products are not manufactured under unsanitary conditions, or labeled in a false or misleading manner. Inspections also may arise from consumer or competitor complaints filed with the FDA. In the event the FDA identifies unsanitary conditions, false or misleading labeling, or any other violation of FDA regulation, FDA may request or a manufacturer may independently decide to conduct a recall or market withdrawal of products.
In addition to our cosmetic products, we also market certain non-prescription drug products, including certain products that are intended to treat acne or be used as sunscreens, which are regulated as over-the-counter (“OTC”) drug products by the FDA. Certain OTC drug products are subject to regulation pursuant to the FDA’s “monographs,” which provide rules applicable to each therapeutic category of non-prescription drug, and establishes conditions, such as active ingredients, uses (indications), doses, labeling, and testing procedures, under which an OTC drug within that particular category may be generally recognized as a safe and effective (“GRASE”), and therefore can be marketed without obtaining pre-market approval of an new drug application (“NDA”) or abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). To be legally marketed, among other things, OTC drug products marketed under an OTC monograph must be manufactured in compliance with the FDA’s GMP requirements for drug products, and the failure to maintain compliance with these requirements could lead to FDA enforcement action. Moreover, a failure to comply with the OTC monograph requirements could lead the FDA to determine that the drug is not GRASE, and thus is a “new drug” requiring approval in accordance with the NDA or ANDA processes, or to make changes to its manufacturing processes or product formulations or labels.
Moreover, the FTC regulates and can bring enforcement action against cosmetic companies for deceptive advertising and lack of adequate scientific substantiation for claims. The FTC requires that companies have a reasonable basis to support marketing claims. What constitutes a reasonable basis can vary depending on the strength or type of claim made, or the market in which the claim is made, but objective evidence substantiating the claim is generally required.
In the E.U., the sale of cosmetic products is regulated under the E.U. Cosmetics Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 setting out the general regulatory framework for finished cosmetic products placed on the E.U. market. The overarching requirement is that a cosmetic product made available on the E.U. market must be safe for human health when used under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use, taking account, in particular, of the following: (a) presentation including conformity with Directive 87/357/EEC regarding health and safety of consumers; (b) labelling; (c) instructions for use and disposal; (d) any other indication or information provided by the responsible person.
Generally, there is no requirement for pre-market approval of cosmetic products in the E.U. However, centralized notification of all cosmetic products placed on the E.U. market is required. Manufacturers are required to notify their products via the E.U. cosmetic products notification portal. Manufacturers are responsible for safety of their marketed finished cosmetic products, and must ensure that they undergo an appropriate scientific safety assessment before cosmetic products are sold. A special database with information on cosmetic substances and ingredients, known as CosIng, enables easy access to data on cosmetic ingredients, including legal requirements and restrictions. We rely on expert consultants for our E.U. product registrations and review of our labelling for compliance with E.U. regulation.
The E.U. Cosmetics Regulation requires the manufacture of cosmetic products to comply with GMPs, which is presumed where the manufacture is in accordance with the relevant harmonized standards. In addition, in the labelling, making available on the market and advertising of cosmetic products, text, names, trademarks, pictures and figurative or other signs must not be used to imply that these products have characteristics or functions they do not have; any product claims in labelling must be capable of being substantiated.
We are also subject to a number of federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, including regulations related to consumer protection, the promotion and sale of merchandise, privacy, use and protection of consumer and employee personal information and data (including the collection of data from minors), behavioral tracking, and advertising and marketing activities (including sweepstakes, contests and giveaways).
Expenditures for Environmental Compliance
We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, provincial, state, municipal and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to, among other matters, safe working conditions, product stewardship and environmental protection, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to land and surface waters, generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials, and the registration and evaluation of chemicals. We maintain policies and procedures to monitor and control environmental, health and safety risks, and to monitor compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements. Compliance with such laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 
Segments
We operate our business as a single operating and reportable segment. For more information regarding segment reporting, see Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15. “Exhibits, financial statement schedules” under the heading “Segment reporting.”
Geographic Information
For information regarding the geographic source of our net sales and the location of our long-lived assets, see Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15. “Exhibits, financial statement schedules” under the heading “Segment reporting.” For information regarding the risks related to our non-U.S. operations, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk factors.”
