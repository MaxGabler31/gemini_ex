ITEM 1 – BUSINESSOVERVIEW 
 We are a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on translating ground-breaking science into genomic therapies that transform patients’ lives using our industry-leading platform technologies in genome editing, gene therapy, gene regulation and cell therapy. 
 We are a leader in the research and development of zinc finger proteins, or ZFPs, a naturally occurring class of proteins found in humans. We have used our knowledge and expertise to develop a proprietary technology platform in both genome editing and gene regulation. ZFPs can be engineered to make zinc finger nucleases, or ZFNs, proteins that can be used to specifically modify DNA sequences by adding or knocking out specific genes, or genome editing, and ZFP transcription factors or ZFP TFs, proteins that can be used to increase or decrease gene expression, or gene regulation. In the process of developing this platform, we have accrued significant scientific, manufacturing and regulatory capabilities and know-how that are generally applicable in the broader field of gene therapy and have capitalized this knowledge into a conventional gene therapy platform based on adeno-associated viral vector, or AAV, cDNA gene transfer.
 Our strategy is to maximize the value and therapeutic use of our technology platforms. In certain therapeutic areas we intend to capture the value of our proprietary genome editing and gene therapy products by forward integrating into manufacturing, development and commercial operations. In other therapeutic areas we intend to partner with biopharmaceutical companies to develop products.
 We are focused on the development of human therapeutics for diverse diseases with well-characterized genetic causes. We have several proprietary clinical and preclinical product candidates in development and have strategically partnered certain programs with biopharmaceutical companies to obtain funding for our own programs and to expedite clinical and commercial development. 
 We have an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating SB-525, a gene therapy for the treatment of hemophilia A, a bleeding disorder. We have ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials evaluating three product candidates using our proprietary in vivo genome editing approach: SB-FIX, for the treatment of hemophilia B, a bleeding disorder, SB-318, for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I, or MPS I, and SB-913 for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II, or MPS II.  MPS I and MPS II are rare lysosomal storage disorders, or LSDs. We are also initiating a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating ST-400, developed using our proprietary ZFN-mediated ex vivo cell therapy platform, for the treatment of beta-thalassemia, a blood disorder. In addition, we have proprietary preclinical and discovery stage programs in other LSDs and monogenic diseases, including certain central nervous system disorders, cancer immunotherapy, immunology and infectious disease.
 In addition, we have proprietary preclinical programs in other monogenic diseases and LSDs. Our preclinical discovery efforts include research into potential therapeutic applications of our technology for certain central nervous system disorders, autoimmune disorders, infectious disease, and others.
 In February 2018, we entered into a global collaboration and license agreement with Kite Pharma, Inc., or Kite, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead, for the research, development and commercialization of potential engineered cell therapies for cancer. In this collaboration, we will work together with Kite on a research program under which we will design ZFNs and AAVs to disrupt and insert certain genes in T cells and natural killer, or NK, cells, including the insertion of genes that encode chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, T-cell receptors, or TCRs and NK-cell receptors, or NKRs, directed to mutually agreed targets. Kite will be responsible for all clinical development and commercialization of any resulting products.  
 In December 2017, we entered into a new research collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, for the development and commercialization of potential gene therapy products that use ZFP TFs to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, or FTLD, linked to mutations of the C9ORF72 gene. Under this agreement, we are working with Pfizer on a research program to identify, characterize and preclinically develop ZFP TFs that satisfy pre-agreed criteria. Pfizer is responsible for subsequent development, manufacturing and commercialization of licensed products.
 In May 2017, we entered into a global collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer for the research, development and commercialization of SB-525, our gene therapy product candidate for hemophilia A, and closely related products. Under this agreement, we are responsible for conducting the Phase 1/2 clinical trial and certain manufacturing activities for SB-525, while Pfizer is responsible for subsequent worldwide development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of SB-525. We and Pfizer may also collaborate in the research and development of additional AAV-based gene therapy products for hemophilia A.  
 4

We have also established a collaborative partnership with Bioverativ, Inc., or Bioverativ, to research, develop and commercialize therapeutic gene-edited cell therapy products in hemoglobinopathies, including beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, or SCD. We expect to begin enrolling patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical study in the first half of 2018. Bioverativ is responsible for subsequent development, manufacturing and commercialization of licensed products.
 
We have a substantial intellectual property position in the genome editing field including the design, selection, composition and use of engineered ZFPs to support our research and development activities. As of February 15, 2018, we either owned outright or have exclusively licensed the commercial rights to over 860 patents issued in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and over 610 patent applications pending worldwide.  We continue to license and file new patent applications that strengthen our core and accessory patent portfolio. We believe that our intellectual property position is a critical element in our ability to research, develop and commercialize products and services based on genome editing, gene therapy, gene regulation and cell therapy.
 In January 2017, we changed our corporate name to “Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.” to underscore our focus on clinical development of genomic therapies using our industry-leading platform technologies across genome editing, gene therapy, gene regulation and cell therapy.
 INTRODUCTION TO GENOME EDITING, GENE THERAPY, CELL THERAPY AND GENE REGULATION
 DNA, Genes, and Proteins 
 Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is present in all cells except mature red blood cells, and encodes the inherited characteristics of all living organisms. A cell’s DNA is organized in chromosomes as thousands of individual units called genes. Genes encode proteins, which are assembled through the process of transcription—whereby DNA is transcribed into ribonucleic acid, or RNA,—and, subsequently, translation—whereby RNA is translated into protein (Figure 1). Proteins are involved in virtually all cell functions. DNA, RNA and proteins comprise many of the targets for pharmaceutical drug discovery and therapeutic intervention. 
Figure 1: 
 Schematic of the relationship between the human genome, DNA, RNA and protein 
 The human body is composed of specialized cells that perform different functions and are thus organized into tissues and organs. All somatic cells in an individual’s body contain the same set of genes. However, only a fraction of these genes are turned on, or expressed, in an individual human cell at any given time. Genes are regulated (i.e. turned on or turned off) by DNA-binding proteins called transcription factors in response to a wide variety of stimuli and developmental signals. Distinct sets of genes are 
 5

expressed in different cell types. It is this pattern of gene expression that determines the structure, biological function and health of all cells, tissues and organisms. The aberrant expression of certain genes can lead to disease. Similarly, a mistake, or mutation in the DNA sequence of a gene, can result in corresponding error in the protein encoded by the gene, which may have serious consequences for the cell and its function. A number of disorders have been identified as caused by the inheritance of a single defective gene. These so-called monogenic diseases include hemophilia A and hemophilia B, LSDs such as MPS I and MPS II, beta-thalassemia, SCD, Huntington’s disease and many others.
 ZFPs are Naturally Occurring Transcription Factors in Humans
 A transcription factor recognizes and binds to a specific DNA sequence within or near a particular gene and causes expression of that gene to be “turned on” (activated) or “turned off” (repressed). ZFPs are the most common class of naturally occurring transcription factors in organisms from yeast to humans. In higher organisms, naturally occurring transcription factors typically comprise two domains: the first is a DNA-binding domain, (designated in Figure 2 as the “Recognition Domain”), which recognizes a target DNA sequence and thereby directs the transcription factor to the proper chromosomal location; the second is a functional domain that causes the target gene to be activated or repressed. To these naturally occurring transcription factors, we have added functional domains which enable genome editing at the site determined by the ZFP DNA-binding domain. 
Figure 2: 
 Schematic of the two-domain structure of a ZFP and its therapeutic functional domain 
 ZFNs can be designed for genome editing and ZFP TFs can be designed for gene regulation 
 Consistent with the modular structure of natural ZFPs, we take a modular approach to the design of the proteins that we engineer. The ZFP portion of our engineered proteins, the DNA-recognition domain, is typically composed of four to six zinc fingers. Each individual finger recognizes and binds to a three or four base pair sequence of DNA and multiple fingers can be linked together to recognize longer stretches of DNA, thereby improving specificity. By modifying the amino acid sequence of a ZFP, we can engineer novel ZFPs capable of recognizing the DNA sequences of a chosen genomic target. We use the engineered ZFP DNA-binding domain to link to a functional domain. The ZFP DNA-binding domain brings the functional domain to the target of interest. Our ability to use our highly specific ZFP technology to precisely target a DNA sequence in a gene of interest provides us with a range of genome editing and gene regulation functions that can be applied in many different cell types. 
 Our engineered ZFPs can be attached to a cleavage domain of a restriction endonuclease, an enzyme that cuts DNA, creating a ZFN. When a pair of ZFNs is bound to the DNA in the correct orientation and spacing, the DNA sequence is cut between the ZFP binding sites. DNA binding by both ZFNs is necessary for cleavage, and both nuclease of the restriction endonuclease must be present in the correct orientation to interact with each other, in order to mediate DNA cleavage. This break in the DNA triggers a natural process of DNA repair in the cell. The repair process can be harnessed to achieve one of several outcomes that may be therapeutically useful (Figure 3). If cells are simply treated with ZFNs alone, the repair process joins the two ends of the broken DNA together and 
 6

frequently results in the loss or addition of a small amount of genetic material at the site of the break. This disrupts the original DNA sequence and can result in the expression of a truncated or non-functional protein from the targeted gene, effectively “knocking out” the gene function. ZFN-mediated genome editing can be used to disrupt genes that are involved in disease pathology. We are using ZFN-mediated genome editing of the BCL11A erythroid enhancer in hematopoietic stem progenitor cells, or HSPCs, which is designed to be a single long-lasting treatment for beta-thalassemia (ST-400) and SCD (BIVV-003). 
 
Figure 3: 
 Schematic of ZFP genome editing and gene regulation
 In contrast, if cells with a mutation in a particular gene are treated not only with ZFNs, but also with a DNA sequence that encodes the correct gene sequence (referred to as a “donor” DNA) and with ZFNs that recognize and bind to sequences flanking the mutation, the cell’s repair machinery can use the donor as a template to correct the mutated gene.  This ZFN-mediated gene correction enables the corrected gene to be expressed in its natural chromosomal context and may provide a novel approach for the precise repair of DNA sequence mutations responsible for certain monogenic diseases. In addition to providing a donor sequence that encodes a complete gene, a new copy of a gene can also be precisely added into the genome at a specific location. The ability to precisely place a gene-sized segment of DNA specifically into a pre-determined location in the genome broadens the range of mutations of a gene that can be corrected in a single step. It also reduces the insertional mutagenesis concerns associated with traditional integrating gene replacement approaches such as lentiviruses, in which the insertion of a new corrective copy of the gene typically occurs at random locations in the genome. Our In Vivo Protein Replacement Platform™, or IVPRP™, in which our ZFN technology is used to insert a gene encoding a therapeutic protein into a location such as the Albumin gene, is an approach that we are investigating for the treatment of hemophilia B (SB-FIX) and LSDs (SB-318 and SB-913), which may potentially provide a single and potentially curative treatment for these diseases. 
 We are also evaluating ZFP TFs with the potential to control or regulate the expression of a target gene in the desired manner (Figure 3). For instance, attaching an activation domain to a ZFP will cause a target gene to be expressed at enhanced levels, relative to expression in an untreated cell. Alternatively, a repression domain causes the gene to be downregulated or completely turned off. Pursuant to a collaboration agreement with Shire International GmbH, or Shire, we have a preclinical program for Huntington’s disease in which we are evaluating a ZFP TF designed to differentially down regulate the mutated disease-causing Huntingtin, or HTT, gene, while leaving expression of the normal gene unchanged. 
 
ZFPs can be designed to accomplish a range of functions in genome editing and gene regulation. 
 To date, we and our partners have designed, engineered and assembled thousands of ZFPs and have tested many of these proteins for their affinity, or tightness of binding to their DNA target, as well as their specificity, or preference for their intended DNA target. We have developed methods for the design, selection and assembly of ZFPs capable of binding to a wide spectrum of DNA 
 7

sequences and genes. We have linked ZFPs to endonuclease domains to create highly specific ZFNs and to numerous functional domains to create gene-specific ZFP TFs. We have demonstrated the ability of these proteins to enable genome editing or gene regulation, of hundreds of genes in dozens of different cell types and in whole organisms, including non-human primates, or NHPs, mice, rats, rabbits, pigs, fruit flies, worms, zebrafish and yeast, and in plant species including canola and maize. We and our collaborators have published data from many of these studies in peer-reviewed scientific journals. ZFNs are currently being used to generate transgenic animals and cell lines that have specific genetic modifications that make them useful models of human disease. These high value biologic tools are being used by academic, and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for medical research and drug development. Our preclinical data have been reviewed by advisory bodies such as the National Institute of Health, or NIH, Recombinant Advisory Committee, or RAC, and regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and we have ongoing clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ZFNs in humans.
 We have employed several strategies for the application of our ZFNs depending on the disease or indication. We routinely deliver our therapeutics as nucleic acids, either as messenger RNA, or mRNA, or encoded in a viral vector such as AAV that the cell then uses to make the protein form of the ZFN or ZFP TF.  We can deliver ZFNs ex vivo (outside the body) to isolated cells of the blood, such as T cells, in the case of our clinical HIV, cancer immunotherapy and immunology programs, and HSPCs for our programs in HIV and monogenic blood diseases such as beta-thalassemia and SCD. We are also developing ZFPs in which we deliver our therapeutic proteins in vivo, either systemically (directly into the blood stream) as in our in vivo genome editing programs in hemophilia and LSD, or directly into a specific tissue such as the brain as in our Huntington’s disease program. 
 ZFPs provide the Opportunity to Develop a New Class of Human Therapeutics 
 We believe that our ZFP technology provides a unique and proprietary basis for a broad new class of drugs that have differential technical advantages over small-molecule drugs, protein pharmaceuticals, RNA-based therapeutics, conventional gene therapy approaches and other genome editing platforms, enabling us to develop therapies for a broad range of unmet medical needs. 
 We can generate highly specific ZFNs for genome editing and ZFP TFs for gene regulation and have developed multiple delivery strategies to administer these therapeutics, including using mRNA, AAV, adenovirus, plasmid, and lipid nanoparticles.  As more genes and DNA sequences are linked to specific diseases, we believe that the clinical breadth and scope of our ZFP applications will continue to expand. 
 For example, ZFPs can: 
  
• | Enable genome editing and gene regulation strategies to address novel drug targets. Engineered ZFNs enable the efficient disruption, correction or targeted addition of a gene sequence in a very precise fashion, and ZFP TFs enable either repression or activation of a therapeutically relevant gene in a cell. This gives our technology a degree of flexibility. Direct, targeted modification of the genome cannot be achieved using conventional gene therapy approaches, antisense RNA, siRNA, conventional small molecules, antibodies, or other proteins. Our ZFN genome editing technology, which requires only brief cellular expression of ZFNs, enables the permanent disruption or addition of a therapeutically relevant gene in a highly targeted fashion. For example, our in vivo genome editing strategy enables targeted insertion of a therapeutic gene into the genome of liver cells. This strategy has the potential to provide an extended or life-long clinical benefit in the treatment of monogenic diseases, such as hemophilia, without the risk of washout of therapeutic genes delivered using non-integrating vectors such as AAV, or the potentially deleterious issues related to random insertion of therapeutic genes into the genome by randomly integrating viral vectors such as lentiviral vectors.

• | Provide therapeutic solutions for targets that cannot be effectively addressed by existing drug modalities. The sequencing and publication of the human genome and growing information generated by genome-wide association studies have enabled the identification of both genes and regulatory sequences as potential new therapeutic targets. Many of these targets have a direct role in disease processes but cannot be bound or modulated for therapeutic purposes by small molecules, monoclonal antibodies or RNA based therapeutics. Alternative therapeutic approaches are required to modulate the biological activity of these so-called “non-druggable” targets. One such target is the BCL11A erythroid enhancer, a regulatory sequence, which we are disrupting using ZFNs in HSPCs in order to elevate levels of fetal globin. This target is being developed in collaboration with Bioverativ as a therapeutic approach for beta-thalassemia and SCD.

• | Provide high specificity and selectivity for targets. ZFNs and ZFP TFs can be designed to act with high specificity. In addition, as there are only two copies of each gene in a cell, there are generally only two targets per cell for ZFNs and ZFP TFs, which means that ZFNs and ZFP TFs need only to be available in the cell to engage a small number of targets, which may reduce the risk of toxicity. In contrast, drugs that act on protein and RNA targets that are naturally present in higher cellular concentrations may need to be administered in higher concentrations. In addition, because of the higher specificity there may be fewer “off-target effects.” Many small molecule and RNA-based approaches either

affect multiple targets demonstrating so-called “off-target effects” or may be toxic in the concentrations required to be therapeutically effective.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provides a genome editing platform with superior qualities for therapeutic development. Unlike other less developed bacterial-based genome editing platforms, such as CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENS, our proprietary ZFN genome editing technology is based on human proteins that have co-evolved with our complex human genome. The relative complexity of the protein-DNA interaction of our ZFN platform and the ability to engineer the entire protein-DNA interface also gives us the ability to optimize the components of our genome editing technology to drive efficient cutting with specificity. The ZFN-mediated mechanism is optimized for both gene insertion and gene knockout and over years of developing this platform, we have engineered our ZFN proteins to provide maximum design density (1:2 base pairs), giving us the capability to target virtually any sequence of interest and to place a ZFN exactly where we choose with single gene specificity. This precision is particularly critical for therapeutic gene insertion and correction. Finally, we have an established validated process for rapid development of a ZFN clinical lead and have taken our therapeutics candidates through regulatory review and into human clinical studies where we are able to evaluate both the safety and efficacy of our approach.

Hemophilia A and B 
 Hemophilia, a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot normally. It is also a monogenic disease, or a disease that is caused by a genetic defect in a single gene. There are several types of hemophilia caused by mutations in genes that encode factors which help the blood clot and stop bleeding when blood vessels are injured. Individuals with hemophilia experience bleeding episodes after injuries and spontaneous bleeding episodes that often lead to joint disease such as arthritis. The most severe forms of hemophilia affect males. The standard treatment for individuals with hemophilia is replacement of the defective clotting factor with regular infusion of recombinant clotting factors or plasma concentrates. These therapies are expensive and sometimes stimulate the body to produce antibodies against the factors that inhibit the benefits of treatment. In these situations, other clotting factors such as Factor VII and X may be used to treat patients. 
 The most prevalent form of the disease, hemophilia A, is caused by a defect in the clotting Factor 8 gene. According to the National Hemophilia Foundation and the World Federation of Hemophilia, hemophilia A occurs in about one in every 5,000 male births in the United States, with approximately 16,000 males currently affected.  Defects in clotting Factor 9 gene lead to hemophilia B.  Hemophilia B occurs in about one in every 25,000 male births in the United States, with approximately 4,000 males currently affected. 
 SB-525 – Hemophilia A 
 We are developing SB-525, a gene therapy product candidate utilizing an AAV carrying a clotting Factor 8 gene construct that is driven by our proprietary synthetic liver specific promoter. In 2016, we presented preclinical data demonstrating production of supraphysiological levels of human Factor VIII clotting protein, or hFVIII, in mice and NHP. In these dose-ranging preclinical studies, mean hFVIII levels of 5 - 230% of normal were observed using AAV doses in the range of 6.00E+11 – 6.00E+12 vg/kg, the most potent dose response reported in NHPs for a human Factor 8 gene construct at the time.  
 In 2017, we initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, the Alta Study, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SB-525 in adults with severe hemophilia A. The Alta Study is an open-label, ascending-dose study designed to enroll up to 20 adult subjects across six potential dose cohorts. In August 2017, we announced that the first subject was treated in our Alta Study. We expect to release preliminary data from the Alta Study by mid-2018.
 SB-525 has been granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations by FDA as well as Orphan Medicinal Product designation by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA.  We are developing SB-525 in collaboration with Pfizer, see “—Collaborations—Pfizer Inc.”
 SB-FIX – Hemophilia B

 We are developing SB-FIX, an in vivo genome editing product candidate, to treat hemophilia B. Utilizing our ZFN genome editing technology, we are adding a new therapeutic copy of the Factor 9 gene precisely into the Albumin gene locus in liver cells, and using the strong endogenous Albumin promoter to drive expression of the newly inserted gene. We believe the potential of this approach to provide a permanent correction for a patient may be optimal for a pediatric population by reducing or eliminating the need for chronic infusions of replacement proteins or clotting factor products. We have published data demonstrating the potential utility of this approach for several different monogenic disease applications in addition to hemophilia B.
 
Preclinical studies of the Albumin genome editing approach have demonstrated that therapeutic levels of Factor IX clotting protein could be generated in a dose-dependent manner in NHPs. There were no significant alterations in circulating Albumin levels.  Studies in mice also demonstrated stable Factor IX production for over one year. Preclinical studies in wildtype mice have demonstrated expression of therapeutic levels of human clotting Factor IX protein, or hFIX, from the liver and into the blood for the duration of the 60 week study. Additional preclinical studies in mouse models of hemophilia B demonstrated expression of therapeutic levels of hFIX from the liver and into the blood, which resulted in the correction of the clotting defect in hemophilia B mice treated with a single dose of SB-FIX. SB-FIX was also evaluated in preclinical NHP studies and demonstrated dose-dependent, therapeutic levels of hFIX expression, between 20-50% of normal, in wildtype cynomolgus monkeys, after a single administration of SB-FIX. Levels of hFIX were stable for up to 3 months in treated NHPs. Furthermore, there was a strong dose-response correlation between the level of gene modification at the Albumin locus and the levels of hFIX measured in the blood. 
  In 2016, we initiated a Phase 1/2, open-label, ascending dose clinical trial, the FIXtendz Study, to evaluate safety and efficacy of SB-FIX in adult males with severe hemophilia B. The FIXtendz Study is designed to enroll up to 12 subjects across three dose cohorts. In February 2018, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, of the United Kingdom granted the Clinical Trial Authorisation, or CTA, for enrollment of subjects into the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating SB-FIX for hemophilia B. The CTA permits evaluation of SB-FIX in both adults and adolescents. Once preliminary safety and efficacy have been 
 10

demonstrated in the ongoing SB-FIX Phase 1/2 clinical trial in adults (18 years of older), we may begin enrolling adolescents (12 - 17 years of age) into the study.
 SB-FIX has been granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations by the FDA.
 Lysosomal Storage Disorders
 LSD are a heterogeneous group of rare inherited disorders including: MPS I, MPS II, Fabry disease, Gaucher disease; and many others. These disorders are caused by defects in genes that encode proteins known as enzymes, which break down and eliminate unwanted substances in cells. These enzymes are found in structures called lysosomes which act as recycling sites in cells, breaking down unwanted material into simple products. A defect in a lysosomal enzyme leads to the accumulation of toxic levels of the substance that the enzyme would normally eliminate. These toxic levels may cause cell damage which can lead to serious health problems.
 MPS I is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the alpha-L-iduronidase, or IDUA, enzyme, resulting in a deficiency of IDUA enzyme, which is required for the degradation of the glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs, dermatan sulfate and heparin sulfate. The inability to degrade GAGs leads to their accumulation within the lysosomes throughout the body. Individuals with this mutation experience multi-organ dysfunction and damage. Depending on the severity of the mutations and degree of residual enzyme activity, affected individuals may develop enlarged internal organs, joint stiffness, skeletal deformities, corneal clouding, hearing loss and cognition impairments. Three forms of MPS I, in order of increasing severity, include Scheie, Hurler-Scheie and Hurler syndromes. According to the National MPS Society, one in 500,000 births in the United States will result in Scheie syndrome, one in 115,000 births in Hurler/Scheie, and one in 100,000 births results in Hurler syndrome. There are approximately 1,000 MPS I patients in the United States. 
 MPS II is an X-linked disorder primarily affecting males and caused by mutations in the gene encoding the iduronate-2-sufatase, or IDS, enzyme.  This results in a deficiency of IDS enzyme, which is required for the degradation of GAGs. Similar to MPS I, the inability to degrade GAGs leads to their accumulation within the lysosomes throughout the body. Individuals with this mutation experience multi-organ dysfunction and damage. Children with MPS II appear normal at birth but begin showing symptoms of developmental delay by age 2 – 3 years.  Depending on the severity of the mutations and degree of residual enzyme activity, affected individuals may develop delayed development, enlarged internal organs, cardiovascular disorders, stunted growth and skeletal abnormalities and hearing loss. The disorder is progressive and symptoms range from mild (normal cognitive function) to severe (cognitively impaired). According to the National MPS Society, one in 100,000 male births in the United States will result in MPS II. There are approximately 500 MPS II patients in the United States. 
 Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder primarily affecting males and caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the alpha-galactosidase A, or alpha-Gal A, enzyme, resulting in a deficiency of alpha-Gal A enzyme, which is required for the degradation of the ganglioside globotriaosylceramide, a particular type of fatty substance. The inability to degrade this fatty substance leads to its accumulation within the lysosomes throughout the body. Individuals with this mutation experience multi-organ dysfunction and damage. Depending on the severity of the mutations and degree of residual enzyme activity, affected individuals may develop progressive kidney damage, heart attack, stroke, gastrointestinal complications, corneal opacity, tinnitus and hearing loss. Milder forms of the disorder present later in life and affect only the heart or kidneys. According to the National Institutes of Health U.S. National Library of Medicine, one in 40,000 to one in 60,000 male births in the United States will result in Fabry disease. There are approximately 2,200 males with Fabry disease in the United States. This mutation can also occur in females, however is less common and the frequency is unknown.
 There are limited treatments currently available for MPS I, MPS II and Fabry disease.  For individuals with MPS I, there are only two options: hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT, for those with the most severe form of the disease (Hurler) and enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, for patients with the attenuated forms of the disease (Hurler-Scheie, Scheie).  However, the reported mortality rate after HSCT is approximately 15% and the survival rate with successful engraftment is 56%. Most patients with milder forms of the disease receive weekly ERT, usually in a doctor’s office. These IDUA enzyme infusions take on average four to six hours to administer. Weekly and bi-weekly ERT infusions are the only available options for MPS II and Fabry disease, respectively. Because of the availability of few treatment options that effectively and safely treat these diseases, there remains significant unmet medical need.
 SB-318 – MPS I
 We are developing SB-318, an in vivo genome editing product candidate, to treat MPS I.  Using the same approach as our hemophilia B product candidate, SB-FIX, we are adding a new therapeutic copy of the IDUA gene precisely into the Albumin gene locus in the genome of liver cells, using the strong endogenous Albumin promoter to drive expression of the newly inserted gene. We believe the potential of this approach to provide a permanent correction for a patient may be optimal for a pediatric population by reducing or eliminating the need for chronic ERT infusions. 
 11

Preclinical mouse model data demonstrated robust levels of IDUA enzyme expression in the liver, blood plasma and spleen of SB-318 treated mice, resulting in a 10-fold increase in IDUA activity, with sustained elevated levels in the blood plasma over the course of the two month study. Additional preclinical mouse model data demonstrated stable production of therapeutic levels of IDUA enzyme from the liver into the circulation and secondary tissues, including the spleen, lung, muscle, heart and brain, after a single intravenous administration of SB-318. This resulted in the significant reduction of GAG biomarkers in all of the tissues. Behavioral data from Barnes maze tests, collected at the end of the four month study, demonstrated statistically significant preservation of cognitive learning and memory in mice treated with SB-318, compared to untreated mice. 
 In 2017, we initiated an open-label, dose-ascending Phase 1/2 clinical trial, the EMPOWERS Study, to evaluate SB-318 in adult subjects with attenuated MPS I. The EMPOWERS Study is designed to enroll up to nine subjects across three ascending dose cohorts. We expect to present preliminary safety and efficacy data from the EMPOWERS Study in 2018. We plan to submit a CTA in the first half of 2018 to initiate enrollment of adolescent and pediatric subjects in the United Kingdom into the Phase 1/2 clinical trial.
 SB-318 MPS I has been granted Orphan Drug, Rare Pediatric Disease and Fast Track designations by the FDA, as well as Orphan Medicinal Product designation by the EMA.
 SB-913 – MPS II
 We are developing SB-913, an in vivo genome editing product candidate, to treat MPS II.  Similar to SB-318, we are using our ZFN genome editing technology to add a new therapeutic copy of the IDS gene precisely into the Albumin gene locus in the genome of liver cells, using the strong endogenous Albumin promoter to drive expression of the newly inserted gene. 
 Preclinical mouse model data demonstrated robust levels of IDS enzyme expression in the liver, blood plasma and spleen of SB-913 treated mice, resulting in a 100-fold increase in IDS activity, with sustained elevated levels in the blood plasma over the course of the entire study. Additional preclinical mouse model data demonstrated stable production of therapeutic levels of IDS enzyme from the liver into the circulation and additional secondary tissues, including the spleen, lung, muscle, heart and brain, after a single intravenous administration of SB-913. This resulted in the significant reduction of GAG biomarkers across all the tissues. Behavioral data from Barnes maze tests, collected at the end of the four month study demonstrated statistically significant preservation of cognitive learning and memory in mice treated with SB-913, compared to untreated mice. 
 In 2017, we initiated an open-label, dose-ascending Phase 1/2 clinical trial, the CHAMPIONS Study, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SB-913 in adult male subjects with attenuated MPS II, designed to enroll up to nine subjects across three ascending dose cohorts. In November 2017, we announced that the first subject had been treated in the CHAMPIONS Study. In February 2018, we presented preliminary six-week safety data from the first subject enrolled in the CHAMPIONS Study. The data demonstrated that the subject tolerated the infusion well. Mild (Grade 1) adverse events related to the study drug were reported on the fourth day after dosing. These were dizziness, weakness and frequent urination, all of which resolved within one day without treatment. No other adverse events related to the study drug have been observed. Liver function tests have remained within normal limits for the patient since the infusion. We expect to present additional safety and efficacy data from the EMPOWERS Study by mid 2018. We plan to submit a CTA in the first half of 2018 to initiate enrollment of adolescent and pediatric subjects in the United Kingdom into the Phase 1/2 clinical trial. 
 SB-913 has been granted Orphan Drug, Rare Pediatric Disease and Fast Track designations by the FDA, as well as Orphan Medicinal Product designation by the EMA.
 ST-920 — Fabry Disease
 We are developing ST-920 for Fabry disease, a gene therapy product candidate utilizing an AAV, carrying a galactosidase alpha, or GLA, gene construct, coding for the alpha-Gal A enzyme, driven by our proprietary synthetic liver specific promoter. We are currently conducting IND-enabling studies for ST-920 and expect to file an IND application with the FDA by mid 2018.

Hemoglobinopathies: Beta-thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease 
 Mutations in the gene encoding beta-globin, the oxygen carrying protein of red blood cells, lead to hemoglobinopathies such as beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, or SCD. Both diseases manifest in the months after birth, when patients switch from producing functional fetal gamma-globin to a mutant form of adult beta-globin, which results in their condition. Naturally occurring increased levels of fetal hemoglobin have been shown to reduce the severity of both beta-thalassemia and SCD.
 Beta-thalassemia is a rare disorder that results in greatly impaired production of healthy red blood cells despite bone marrow over activity, leading to life-threatening anemia, enlarged spleen, liver and heart, and bone abnormalities. We are focused on Beta-thalassemia major which is a severe form of thalassemia that requires regular, often monthly, blood transfusions and subsequent iron-chelation therapy to treat iron overload. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, estimates that 1,000 people have beta-thalassemia major in the United States, and an unknown number carry the genetic trait and can pass it on to their children. 
 In SCD, the mutation causes the red blood cells to form an abnormal sickle or crescent shape. The cells are fragile and deliver less oxygen to the body’s tissues. They can also get stuck more easily in small blood vessels and break into pieces that can interrupt healthy blood flow which further decrease the amount of oxygen flowing to body tissues. Almost all patients with SCD experience these painful vaso-occlusive crises, which can last from hours to days and may cause irreversible organ damage. Current standard of care is to manage and control symptoms, and to limit the number of crises. Treatments include administration of hydroxyurea, blood transfusions, iron-chelation therapy, pain medications and antibiotics. The CDC estimates that there are 90,000 to 100,000 Americans living with SCD, which occurs in approximately 1 out of every 365 African-American births and 1 out of every 16,300 Hispanic-American births.
 ST-400 – Beta-thalassemia; BIVV-003 — SCD
 We are developing ST-400 for the treatment of beta-thalassemia and our collaboration partner, Bioverativ, is developing BIVV-003 for the treatment of SCD.  Both ST-400 and BIVV-003 are genome-edited cell therapies that use our ZFN genome editing technology to modify a patient’s own, or autologous, HSPCs to produce functional red blood cells using fetal hemoglobin. Our genome editing technology can be used in HSPCs to precisely disrupt regulatory sequences that control the expression of key transcriptional regulators, such as the BCL11A erythroid enhancer sequence, to reverse the switch from expression of the mutant adult beta-globin back to the production of functional fetal gamma-globin. 
 The current standard of care for beta-thalassemia includes chronic blood transfusions, while the standard of care for SCD is a bone marrow transplant, or BMT, of HSPCs from a “matched” related donor, or an allogeneic BMT. However, these therapies are limited due to the risk of iron overload with blood transfusions, requiring subsequent iron chelation therapy, and the scarcity of matched donors and the significant risk of Graft versus Host Disease, or GvHD, with BMTs after transplantation of the foreign cells. By performing genome editing in HSPCs that are isolated from and subsequently returned to the same patient (i.e., an autologous HSPC transplant), our approach has the potential to address these limitations. The goal of this approach is to develop a one-time long-lasting treatment for beta-thalassemia and SCD.
 Preclinical data from clinical-scale in vitro studies have demonstrated that ST-400 and BIVV-003 can be manufactured by reproducible, high-level, ZFN-mediated modification in HSPCs mobilized in peripheral blood at clinical production scale (>108 cells), with an on-target modification efficiency of greater than 80%. Furthermore, erythroid differentiation of enhancer targeted cells showed modification of both BCL11A erythroid enhancer alleles in more than 50% of the erythroid colonies and resulted in a greater than four-fold increase in gamma globin mRNA and protein production, compared to controls. Specificity studies of ST-400 and BIVV-003 revealed no detectable off-target activity using state-of-the art, unbiased, highly sensitive oligo-capture assays.  Preclinical data from in vivo studies in immune-deficient mice demonstrated robust long-term (19 weeks) engraftment and that targeted gene modification was maintained through multi-lineage differentiation in the bone marrow and peripheral blood.
 Our IND for ST-400 was cleared by the FDA in September 2017, and we have designed an open-label, single arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ST-400 in up to 6 adult subjects with beta-thalassemia.  We expect to initiate this trial in early 2018. 
 Bioverativ is our partner for ST-400 and is responsible for the clinical development of BIVV-003 for SCD. For more information relating to our collaboration with Bioverativ, see “—Collaborations—Bioverativ.”

CNS-Tauopathies
 We are using our ZFP-TF gene regulation platform to develop potential gene therapies for tauopathy disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. We believe a reduction in tau protein levels can help reduce intracellular tau protein aggregation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in neurons, potentially ameliorating or reversing disease progression. We believe this approach may have a significant advantage compared to monoclonal antibody-based approaches to Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathy disorders because it is designed to selectively down-regulate the tau gene in neurons with the goal of reducing all forms of the tau protein globally across the CNS. In contrast, monoclonal antibody-based approaches are limited in that they can only bind to certain forms of tau proteins.
 
Preclinical studies in wildtype mice demonstrated that a single administration of tau-targeting ZFP-TFs resulted in up to 70% reduction of tau mRNA and protein expression across the entire CNS, as well as sustained and well-tolerated ZFP-TF expression with minimal impact on inflammatory markers. Additional preclinical studies in amyloid mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease demonstrated up to 80% reduction of tau protein levels in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as significantly reduced neuritic dystrophy after a single administration of ZFP-TFs in mice with established disease pathology.
 
We are currently conducting preclinical studies in NHPs to evaluate our ZFP-TFs in larger mammalian species. We intend to seek a partner with disease area expertise for the clinical development and commercialization of this program.
 C9ORF72–linked ALS/FTLD 
 In December 2017, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer to develop and commercialize gene therapy products that use our ZFP TFs to treat ALS and FTLD linked to mutations of the C9ORF72 gene. ALS and FTLD are part of a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders caused by mutations in the C9ORF72 gene that involve hundreds of additional repetitions of a six base pair sequence of DNA. This ultimately leads to the deterioration of motor neurons, in the case of ALS, or neurons in the frontal and temporal lobes, in the case of FTLD. Currently, there are no cures to halt or reverse the progression of ALS or FTLD. The C9ORF72 mutation is linked to approximately one-third of cases of familial ALS. We and Pfizer plan to investigate allele-specific ZFP-TFs with the potential to differentiate the mutant C9ORF72 allele from the wildtype allele and to specifically down-regulate expression of the mutant form of the gene.
 We also have research stage programs in other monogenic diseases, immunology and cancer immunotherapy. See “—Collaborations—Pfizer Inc.,” for more information relating to this agreement.
 Huntington’s Disease 
 Huntington’s disease is an inherited, progressive neurologic disease for which there is no treatment or cure. The disease is caused by a particular type of mutation in a single gene, the HTT gene. Most patients inherit one normal and one defective or mutant copy of the HTT gene, which causes Huntington’s disease. The mutation is characterized by expansion of a repeated stretch of DNA sequence within the gene called a “CAG repeat.” A normal copy of the HTT gene usually has 10 to 29 of these CAG repeats but a defective copy has many more—generally greater than 39 repeats. While the protein produced by the normal copy of the gene appears to be essential for development (mice lacking the gene do not survive to birth), the product of the mutated gene is damaging to cells. Symptoms, which include deterioration of muscle control, cognition and memory, usually develop between 35 and 44 years of age. It is known that the greater the number of CAG repeats, the earlier the onset. Huntington’s disease is usually fatal within 15 to 20 years after the onset of symptoms. The disease has a high prevalence for an inherited disorder. According to the Huntington’s Disease Society of America, approximately 30,000 people in the United States have Huntington’s disease. In addition, it is estimated that approximately 200,000 people in the United States are at risk of developing the disease.  
 Research in animal models of the disease has shown that lowering the levels of the mutant HTT protein can prevent, or even reverse, disease progression. However, to date most “HTT-lowering” methods decrease levels of both the normal and mutant forms of HTT, raising potential safety concerns given the importance of normal HTT protein. In collaboration with Shire, we are developing ZFP TFs that can selectively repress the expression of the mutant disease-causing form of HTT while leaving expression levels of the normal gene unchanged. Preclinical studies in animal models of the disease are ongoing and Shire is responsible for all clinical development activities including filing the IND application.  For more information on our collaboration with Shire, see “—Collaborations—Shire International GmbH.”
 Legacy Clinical Research Programs
 Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS 
 HIV infection results in the death of immune system cells, particularly CD4+ T-cells, and thus leads to AIDS, a condition in which the body’s immune system is depleted to such a degree that the patient is unable to fight off common infections. Ultimately, 
 14

these patients succumb to opportunistic infections or cancers. According to the most recent data from the CDC, it is estimated that there were 1.0 million people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States in 2015, and there are now over 36.7 million people living with HIV and AIDS worldwide.
 Current Treatments and Unmet Medical Need 
 Currently, there are over 30 antiretroviral drugs approved by the FDA to treat people infected with HIV. While these drugs can suppress virus in the blood to undetectable levels, they cannot eliminate the reservoir of cells containing genomically-integrated HIV from the body. Hence, individuals infected with HIV need to take antiretroviral drugs continuously. The drugs are expensive and can have significant side effects over time. There is no therapeutic approach available that protects CD4+ T-cells, suppresses viral load, reduces the viral reservoir and does not require daily dosing. 
SB-728 – HIV/AIDS 
 SB-728 uses our ZFN-mediated genome editing technology to disrupt the CCR5 gene in cells of a patient’s immune system to make these cells permanently resistant to HIV infection. CCR5 is a co-receptor for HIV entry into T-cells and if CCR5 is not expressed on the cell surface HIV cannot infect them or infects them with lower efficiency. The aim of this approach is to provide the patient with a population of HIV-resistant cells that can fight HIV and opportunistic infections, by mimicking the naturally occurring CCR5 delta-32 mutation that renders a population of individuals largely resistant to infection by the most common strains of HIV. We are evaluating this genome editing approach to disrupt the CCR5 gene in both T cells and HSPCs as two potential therapeutic candidates, SB-728-T and SB-728-HSPC, respectively.
  We have conducted several clinical trials with SB-728-T, which were designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of SB-728-T, as well as the effect of SB-728-T on subjects’ CD4 T-cell counts, levels of CCR5-modified T-cells, viral burden during a treatment interruption (TI) from anti-retroviral therapy, or ART, and measure of the viral reservoir. The data to date have demonstrated an ability to efficiently knock out the CCR5 gene in T-cells by ZFN-driven genome editing and grow the cells ex vivo, that a single infusion of SB-728-T led to proven engraftment, expansion and persistence of T-cells in vivo, sustained increases in CD4 T-cell counts, a significant and continuous decay of the HIV reservoir and the ability of certain subjects to control their viral loads for prolonged periods in the absence of ART. Over 100 subjects have been treated to date and the treatment appears to be well-tolerated.
 In addition, we have an ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial (SB-728mR-HSPC) to investigate SB-728-HSPC as a self-renewable and potentially lifelong source of HIV-resistant immune cells.
 We plan to advance the SB-728 program through externally-funded collaborations.
 COLLABORATIONS 
 We have established collaborative and strategic partnerships for several of our therapeutic programs and also for several non-therapeutic applications of our technology. We will continue to pursue further partnerships when appropriate with selected pharmaceutical and biotechnology to fund internal research and development activities and to assist in product development and commercialization. We are applying our ZFN technology platform to several commercial applications in which our products provide us and our strategic partners and collaborators with potential technical, competitive and economic advantages.

 During the research program term and subject to certain exceptions, except pursuant to this agreement, we will be prohibited from researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing, for the purpose of treating cancer, any cell therapy product that, as a result of ex vivo genome editing, expresses a CAR, TCR or NKR that is directed to a target expressed on or in a human cancer cell. After the research program term concludes and subject to certain exceptions, except pursuant to this agreement, we will be prohibited 
 15

from developing, manufacturing and commercializing, for the purpose of treating cancer, any cell therapy product that, as a result of ex vivo genome editing, expresses a CAR, TCR or NKR that is directed to a candidate target.  
 Upon the effectiveness of this agreement, we will receive a $150 million upfront payment from Kite. In addition, Kite will reimburse our direct costs to conduct the joint research program, and Kite will be responsible for all subsequent development, manufacturing and commercialization of any licensed products. We are also eligible to receive contingent development- and sales-based milestone payments that could total up to $3.01 billion if all of the specified milestones set forth in this agreement are achieved. Of this amount, approximately $1.26 billion relates to the achievement of specified research, clinical development, regulatory and first commercial sale milestones, and approximately $1.75 billion relates to the achievement of specified sales-based milestones if annual worldwide net sales of licensed products reach specified levels. Each development- and sales-based milestone payment is payable (i) only once for each licensed product, regardless of the number of times that the associated milestone event is achieved by such licensed product, and (ii) only for the first ten times that the associated milestone event is achieved, regardless of the number of licensed products that may achieve such milestone event.  In addition, we will be entitled to receive escalating, tiered royalty payments with a percentage in the single digits based on potential future annual worldwide net sales of licensed products. These royalty payments will be subject to reduction due to patent expiration, entry of biosimilar products to the market and payments made under certain licenses for third-party intellectual property.  
 Kite has the right to terminate this agreement, in its entirety or on a per licensed product or per candidate target basis, for any reason after a specified notice period.  Each party has the right to terminate this agreement on account of the other party’s bankruptcy or material, uncured breach.  
 
Pfizer Inc. 
 
We have two separate collaboration agreements with Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer.  In May 2017, we entered into an exclusive, global collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer, pursuant to which we established a collaboration for the research, development and commercialization of SB-525, our gene therapy product candidate for hemophilia A, and closely related products. 
 
Under this agreement, we are responsible for conducting the Phase 1/2 clinical trial and certain manufacturing activities for SB-525, while Pfizer is responsible for subsequent worldwide development, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of SB-525. We may also collaborate in the research and development of additional AAV-based gene therapy products for hemophilia A. 
 
We received an upfront fee of $70.0 million and are eligible to receive development milestone payments contingent on the achievement of specified clinical development, intellectual property, regulatory and first commercial sale milestones for SB-525 and potentially other products. The total amount of potential clinical development, intellectual property, regulatory, and first commercial sale milestone payments, assuming the achievement of all specified milestones in this agreement, is $475.0 million, which includes up to $300.0 million for SB-525 and up to $175.0 million for other products that may be developed under the agreement, subject to reduction on account of payments made under certain licenses for third party intellectual property. In addition, Pfizer agreed to pay us royalties for each potential licensed product developed under the agreement that are an escalating tiered, double-digit percentage of the annual net sales of such product and are subject to reduction due to patent expiration, entry of biosimilar products to the market and payment made under certain licenses for third party intellectual property. 
 
Subject to the terms of the agreement, we granted Pfizer an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use certain technology controlled by us for the purpose of developing, manufacturing and commercializing SB-525 and related products. Pfizer granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty free, fully paid license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use certain manufacturing technology developed under the agreement and controlled by Pfizer to manufacture our products that utilize the AAV delivery system. During a specified period, neither we nor Pfizer will be permitted to clinically develop or commercialize, outside of the collaboration, certain AAV-based gene therapy products for hemophilia A.
 
Unless earlier terminated, the agreement has a term that continues, on a per product and per country basis, until the later of (i) the expiration of patent claims that cover the product in a country, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for a product in a country, and (iii) fifteen years after the first commercial sale of a product in a country.  Pfizer has the right to terminate the agreement without cause in its entirety or on a per product or per country basis.  The agreement may also be terminated by either party based on an uncured material breach by the other party or the bankruptcy of the other party.  Upon termination for any reason, the license granted by us to Pfizer to develop, manufacture and commercialize SB-525 and related products will automatically terminate.  Upon termination by us for cause or by Pfizer any country or countries, Pfizer will automatically grant us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain technology controlled by Pfizer to develop, manufacture and commercialize SB-525 in the terminated country or countries.  
 In December 2017, we entered into a separate exclusive, global collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of potential gene therapy products that use ZFP-TFs to treat ALS and FTLD linked to mutations 
 16

of the C9ORF72 gene. Pursuant to this agreement, we agreed to work with Pfizer on a research program to identify, characterize and preclinically develop ZFP-TFs that bind to and specifically reduce expression of the mutant form of the C9ORF72 gene.
 We received a $12.0 million upfront payment from Pfizer and are eligible to receive up to $60.0 million in development milestone payments from Pfizer contingent on the achievement of specified preclinical development, clinical development and first commercial sale milestones, and up to $90.0 million commercial milestone payments if annual worldwide net sales of the licensed products reach specified levels. In addition, Pfizer will pay us royalties based on an escalating tiered, mid- to high-single digit percentage of the annual worldwide net sales of the licensed products. These royalty payments are subject to reduction due to patent expiration, entry of biosimilar products to the market and payments made under certain licenses for third party intellectual property. Each party will be responsible for the cost of its performance of the research program. Pfizer will be operationally and financially responsible for subsequent development, manufacturing and commercialization of the licensed products.
 Subject to the terms of the agreement, we granted Pfizer an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide, license under our relevant patents and know-how to develop, manufacture and commercialize gene therapy products that use resulting ZFP-TFs that satisfy pre-agreed criteria. During a specified period, neither our company nor Pfizer will be permitted to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize outside of the collaboration any zinc finger proteins that specifically bind to the C9ORF72 gene.
 Unless earlier terminated, the agreement has a term that continues, on a per licensed product and per country basis, until the later of (i) the expiration of patent claims that cover the licensed product in a country, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for a licensed product in a country, and (iii) fifteen years after the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a major market country.  Pfizer also has the right to terminate the agreement without cause in its entirety or on a per product or per country basis. The agreement may also be terminated by either party based on an uncured material breach by the other party or the bankruptcy of the other party. The agreement will also terminate if we are unable to identify any lead candidates for development within a specified period of time or if Pfizer elects not to advance a lead candidate beyond a certain development milestone within a specified period of time. Upon termination for any reason, the license granted by us to Pfizer to develop, manufacture and commercialize licensed products under the agreement will automatically terminate. Upon termination by us for cause or by Pfizer without cause for any licensed product or licensed products in any country or countries, we will have the right to negotiate with Pfizer to obtain a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain technology controlled by Pfizer to develop, manufacture and commercialize the licensed product or licensed products in the terminated country or countries. 
 Following termination by us for Pfizer’s material breach, Pfizer will not be permitted to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize ZFPs that specifically bind to the C9ORF72 gene for a period of time. Following termination by Pfizer for our material breach, we will not be permitted to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize ZFPs that specifically bind to the C9ORF72 gene for a period of time.
 Bioverativ Inc. 
 We are party to an exclusive worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Bioverativ to develop therapeutics for hemoglobinopathies, focused on beta-thalassemia and SCD. Under the agreement, we are jointly conducting two research programs: the beta-thalassemia program and the SCD program. In the beta-thalassemia program, we are responsible for all discovery, research and development activities through the first human clinical trial. In the SCD program, both parties are responsible for research and development activities through the submission of an IND application for ZFP therapeutics intended to treat SCD. Bioverativ reimburses us for agreed upon internal and external program-related costs. 
 Under both programs, Bioverativ is responsible for subsequent worldwide clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of licensed products developed under the agreement. At the end of the specified research terms for each program or under certain specified circumstances, Bioverativ has the right to step in and take over any of our remaining activities. Furthermore, we have an option to co-promote in the United States any licensed products to treat beta-thalassemia and SCD developed under the agreement, and Bioverativ will compensate us for such co-promotion activities. Subject to the terms of the agreement, we have granted Bioverativ an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use certain ZFP and other technology controlled by us for the purpose of researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing licensed products developed under the agreement. We have also granted Bioverativ a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under our interest in certain other intellectual property developed pursuant to the agreement. During the term of the agreement, we are not permitted to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize, outside of the agreement, certain gene therapy products that target genes relevant to the licensed products. 
 Under the agreement, we received an upfront license fee of $20.0 million and are eligible to receive development and sales milestone payments upon the achievement of specified regulatory, clinical development and sales milestones. The total amount of potential regulatory, clinical development, and sales milestone payments, assuming the achievement of all specified milestones in the agreement, is $276.3 million. In addition, we will receive royalty payments for each licensed product that are a tiered double-digit percentage of annual net sales of each product. 
 17

The agreement may be terminated by (i) us or Bioverativ for the uncured material breach of the other party, (ii) us or Bioverativ for the bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding of the other party; (iii) Bioverativ, upon 180 days’ advance written notice to us and (iv) Bioverativ, for certain safety reasons upon written notice to, and after consultation with, us. As a result, actual future milestone payments could be lower than the amounts stated above. 
 Shire International GmbH 
 We are party to a collaboration and license agreement with Shire International GmbH, or Shire, to research, develop and commercialize a ZFP therapeutic for treating Huntington’s disease. We received an upfront license fee of $13.0 million. Shire does not have any milestone payment obligations, but is required to pay single digit percentage royalties to us, up to a specified maximum cap, on the commercial sales of therapeutic products for Huntington’s disease. We are required to pay single digit percentage royalties to Shire, up to a specified maximum cap, on commercial sales of therapeutic products from programs returned under the original agreement (which include blood clotting Factors VIII and IX) that use two zinc fingers. 
 Pursuant to the agreement, we granted Shire an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use our ZFP technology for the purpose of developing and commercializing human therapeutic and diagnostic products for the HTT gene. During the term of the agreement, we are not permitted to research, develop or commercialize, outside of the agreement, certain products that target the HTT gene. We satisfied the deliverables and research services responsibilities within the amended arrangement which were completed in 2017. The agreement may be terminated by (i) us or Shire, in whole or in part, for the uncured material breach of the other party, (ii) us or Shire for the bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding of the other party and (iii) Shire, in its entirety, effective upon at least 90 days’ advance written notice. 
Other Partnerships 
 In addition to our partnerships for the development of human therapeutic applications, we have also licensed our technology in several other areas, such as plant agriculture and research reagents, including the production of transgenic animals and cell-line engineering.  These license partners include Dow AgroSciences LLC, Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Genentech, Inc., Open Monoclonal Technology, Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Patents and licenses are important to our business. Our strategy is to file or license patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that we consider important for the development of our genome editing and gene regulation technology. We seek patent protection and licenses that relate to our technology and candidates in our pipeline and/or may be important to our future. We have filed numerous patents and patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, and foreign jurisdictions. This proprietary intellectual property includes methods relating to the design of zinc finger, Transcription activator-like effector, or TALE, proteins and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, or CRISPR/Cas editing systems, therapeutic applications of genome editing technology, enabling technologies related to our platform and the use of genome editing across a variety of applications. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, proprietary know–how, continuing technological innovations, trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, materials transfer agreements, research agreements and licensing agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. 
 In-Licensed Technology 
 We have licensed intellectual property directed to the design, selection, and use of ZFPs, ZFNs and ZFP TFs for genome editing and gene regulation from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Johnson & Johnson, The Scripps Research Institute, the California Institute of Technology and the University of Utah. These licenses grant us rights to make, use and sell ZFPs, ZFNs and ZFP TFs under 9 families of patent filings. As of February 15, 2018, these patent filings have resulted in over 10 issued U.S. patents and over 40 granted foreign patents are still active, with 3 currently pending U.S. patent applications and 8 pending applications in foreign patent offices. We have non-exclusive licenses from the NIH for intellectual property related to the composition of the AAV5 vector and to methods of production of AAV, both of which will expire in 2021. 
 We entered into a patent license agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, in May 1996, as subsequently amended, whereby MIT granted us a worldwide exclusive license to technology and patents relating to the design, selection and use of ZFPs for all fields of use, including the right to sublicense. Under the patent license agreement, we are obligated to pay an annual license fee, low single-digit royalties of product sales, sublicense issuance fees and annual sublicense maintenance fees, a percentage of our sublicense revenues, and milestone payments upon achievement of certain commercial development milestones. The aggregate milestone payments under the patent license agreement are $450,000, of which $150,000 has been paid. At our request, the patent license has been amended to return some of the intellectual property that was added via amendment after the 
 18

original agreement was put in place.  This does not affect the development of our technology. The patent license agreement still expires upon the expiration of the last patent covered by the remainder of patents under the license agreement. Based on currently licensed patents, the patent license agreement will expire in October 2019. MIT may terminate the license agreement upon a material default by us that remains uncured following written notice. We may terminate the license agreement at any time upon six months’ written notice. 
 We entered into a sublicense agreement with Johnson & Johnson in May 1996, whereby Johnson & Johnson granted us a worldwide exclusive sublicense to technology and patents for the research, development and commercialization of human and animal therapeutic and diagnostic products using engineered ZFPs, including the right to sublicense. These patents were originally exclusively licensed by Johnson & Johnson from The Scripps Research Institute. Under the sublicense agreement, we will pay low single-digit royalty payments based upon sales of license products by us or our sublicensees and a milestone payment upon the achievement of a commercial development milestone. The sublicense agreement expires upon the expiration of the last patent covered by the sublicense agreement. Based on currently issued patents and currently filed patent applications, the sublicense agreement will expire on or about June 5, 2018. Johnson & Johnson has the right to terminate the sublicense agreement upon a breach or default by us that remains uncured following written notice of such default. We may terminate the sublicense agreement at any time upon sixty days’ written notice. 
 We entered into a license agreement with The Scripps Research Institute in March 2000, as subsequently amended, whereby The Scripps Research Institute granted us a worldwide exclusive license to technology and patents for the research, development and commercialization of products and services using engineered ZFPs, excluding the use of these engineered ZFPs in plant agriculture, therapeutics and diagnostics. Under the license agreement, we are required to pay a low-single digit royalty on sales of licensed products by us and our sublicensees, subject to an annual minimum. The license agreement expires upon the expiration of the last patent covered by the license agreement. Based on currently issued patents and currently filed patent applications, the license agreement will expire on or about May 27, 2018. Each party may terminate the license agreement upon a material default by the other party that remains uncured following written notice. 
 We entered into a license agreement with California Institute of Technology, or CalTech, in November 2003, as subsequently amended, whereby CalTech granted us a worldwide exclusive license to certain patents related to chimeric nucleases for genome targeting for all fields of use, including the right to sublicense.  In consideration of the license grant, we issued certain shares of our common stock to CalTech, but have no obligations to make milestone or royalty payments to CalTech.  The license agreement expires upon the expiration of the intellectual property rights licensed to us. Based on currently issued patents and currently filed patent applications, the license agreement will expire in September 2023. Each party may terminate the license agreement upon a material default by the other party that remains uncured following written notice.  We may terminate the agreement at any time upon 30 days written notice.
 We entered into a patent license agreement with the University of Utah Research Foundation, in September 2004, as subsequently amended, whereby Utah granted us a worldwide license to technology and patents relating to the use of ZFNs for all fields of use, including the right to sublicense. Under the patent license agreement, we are obligated to pay an annual license fee, low single-digit royalties of product sales, sublicense issuance fees and annual sublicense maintenance fees, a percentage of our sublicense revenues, and milestone payments upon achievement of certain commercial development milestones. The license agreement expires on the expiration of the last patent covered by the patent license agreement.  Based on currently issued patents, the license agreement will expire in March 2025.  Utah may terminate the license agreement upon a default by us that remains uncured following written notice.  We may terminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days written notice.  
 We have entered into licenses potentially useful for specific therapeutic uses of our genome editing technologies with the Regents of the University of California and the Children's Medical Center Corporation.  The patents included in these licenses relate to CNS disorders and hemoglobinopathies, respectively. These licenses include 2 patent families, including 3 issued U.S. patents, over 20 pending foreign patents and 2 pending U.S. patents.
 Our Intellectual Property 
 In addition to our in-licensed patent portfolio, as of February 15, 2018, we had over 150 families of owned or co-owned patent filings, over 180 issued U.S. patents, over 600 granted foreign patents, over 110 pending U.S. patent applications and over 490 pending foreign patent applications. These patent filings are directed to the design, composition and use of ZFPs, ZFNs, ZFP TFs, TALE proteins and CRISPR/Cas systems and other technology related to our programs.
 Some of the earliest zinc finger patents in our portfolio began expiring in 2015, with the average expiration of our currently issued patents expiring being late-2026. However, we have continued to build on this patent portfolio and have been issued additional 
 19

patents and have applications pending that provide protection for our ZFP technology. These patents in our portfolio may be subject to Patent Term Adjustment (due to delays in patent prosecution by the USPTO), Patent Term Extension (due to review of a patented product by a regulatory agency) or terminal disclaimer. Additionally, patents that may be issued from our pending applications will extend the patent exclusivity of our patent estate. Accordingly, all dates given above for patent expirations are estimates and the actual dates of expirations may differ. 
 We believe that our licensed patents and patent applications, as well as our issued patents and pending patent applications, in the aggregate, will provide us with a substantial intellectual property position in our commercial development of our genome editing, gene therapy, cell therapy and gene regulation programs. In this regard, patents issued to us, applied for by us, or exclusively and non-exclusively licensed to us, cover the following types of inventions, processes and products:

 We have been advised that certain aspects of our technology can give us and our collaborators independence from third party patent claims to gene sequences. In general, under U.S. patent law, a patent may be obtained for any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter. An underlying theme of U.S. patent law, as related to biotechnology, is that the sequence of a gene, as it exists in the chromosome, is not patentable, even when newly discovered, although a cDNA corresponding to the transcription product of that gene may be in select instances. Accordingly, U.S. patent claims to DNA sequences can cover only isolated cDNAs, or modified nucleic acid sequences (e.g., a purified DNA fragment or a DNA sequence inserted into a vector). We have been advised that U.S. patent claims to DNA sequences do not, and cannot, cover gene sequences as they exist in their natural chromosomal environment, and international patent law is even more stringent than U.S. patent law in this regard. Most current methods for over-expression of a gene or protein involve the introduction into a cell of a vector containing a DNA encoding the protein to be over-expressed. Because such a vector contains isolated cDNA sequences that encode the protein, it would be covered by any patent claims to those sequences. In contrast, our methods for over-expression utilize ZFP TFs that target endogenous genes as they exist in the chromosome. As a result, our gene regulation methods do not require the use of isolated cDNA sequences encoding the protein to be over-expressed and, our counsel has advised us, do not infringe patent claims to such sequences. Notwithstanding this advice, we realize that others could take a contrary position that could result in litigation. While we believe that we would prevail in any such litigation, the uncertainties involved in litigation generally make it impossible to provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of such matters. See “Risk Factors—Because it is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and third parties have filed patent applications that are similar to ours, we cannot ensure the proprietary protection of our technologies and products.”
20

The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, including our patent position, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal tenets are largely unresolved and are subject to interpretation and refinement by the court system. Patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents and the coverage claimed in a patent application may be significantly reduced before a patent is issued. Although we have filed for patents on some aspects of our technology, we cannot provide assurances that patents will be issued as a result of these pending applications or that any patent that has been or may be issued will be upheld. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. For example, our issued European patents EP2171052 and EP2527435 have been opposed in Europe. Our EP2281050 case was revoked during Opposition in November 2016.  Similarly, EP2171052 and EP2527435 underwent Opposition hearings in early 2017. Although these cases emerged from the Opposition hearings, the opponent filed appeals that are currently underway, and we do not know what the outcome of these procedures will be. The claims of these patents may be amended such that claim scope is reduced or the patents may be revoked as a result of these procedures. 
 In the future, third parties may assert patent, copyright trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. Any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties, if determined adversely to us, could significantly harm our business. See “Risk Factors—Because it is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and third parties have filed patent applications that are similar to ours, we cannot ensure the proprietary protection of our technologies and products.” 
 COMPETITION 
 We, and our licensed partners, are the leaders in the research, development, and commercialization of DNA binding proteins for genome editing and regulation of gene expression. We are aware of several companies focused on other methods for editing genes and regulating gene expression and a limited number of commercial and academic groups pursuing the development of ZFP gene regulation and genome editing technology. The field of applied gene regulation and genome editing is highly competitive and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future from a number of different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies; academic and research institutions; and government agencies that will seek to develop ZFPs as well as technologies that will compete with our ZFP technology platform, such as TALE proteins and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. 
 Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA approval, or commercializing competitive products before us. If we commence commercial product sales, we may be competing against companies with greater marketing and manufacturing capabilities, areas in which we have limited or no experience. In addition, any product candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing products that have long histories of safe and effective use. 
 Although we are in the clinical development phase of operations and have no current therapeutic product sales, we believe the following companies, products and/or technologies may potentially be competitive with our technology or our products under development: 
  
• | Protein pharmaceuticals under development at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as Pfizer, Baxter International Inc., Bayer AG, Novo Nordisk A/S, Genzyme Corp., Shire, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Biogen Inc., Acceleron Pharma Inc. and numerous other pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gene therapy companies developing gene-based products in clinical trials. uniQure N.V.’s product for lipoprotein lipase deficiency and GlaxoSmithKline plc’s, or GSK, product for severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency are approved in Europe. No other gene therapy products have yet been approved. Our competitors in this category may include, but not be limited to, uniQure N.V., BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., REGENXBIO Inc., Spark Therapeutics, Inc., Dimension Therapeutics, Inc., Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., Shire, Pfizer, and GSK.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cell therapy companies developing cell-based products. Our competitors in this category may include Novartis AG, Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC, bluebird bio, Inc., Cellectis S.A., Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Kite, Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., and Iovance Biotechnologies, Inc..
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nuclease technologies under development for therapeutic applications of genome modification including companies such as Editas Medicine, Inc., CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Caribou Biosciences, Inc. and Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. developing the CRISPR/Cas9 system, Cellectis S.A. developing TALE nucleases and meganucleases, bluebird bio, Inc. developing Homing Endonucleases and MegaTALs and Precision BioSciences, Inc. developing meganucleases.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Antisense therapeutics and RNA interference technology, including RNAi and microRNA, which are technologies that may compete with us in the development of novel therapeutic products acting through the regulation of gene expression. These technologies are being developed by several companies including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Genzyme Corp. and Regulus Therapeutics Inc.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21

 
• | Small molecules in development from both in-house drug discovery programs of pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, Inc., GSK, Novartis AG and Merck & Co., Inc., as well as from biotechnology companies with expertise and capabilities in small molecule discovery and development such as Gilead, Genzyme Corp. and Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., which has a small molecule product in development for SCD.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monoclonal antibody companies and product candidates from certain biotechnology firms such as Genentech, Inc. and Amgen Inc.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect to face intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions, for licenses to proprietary technology and for subjects in our clinical trials of treatments for rare diseases. These competitors, either alone or with their collaborative partners, may succeed in developing technologies or products that are more effective or less costly than ours. 
 Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to: 
  
• | develop safe, efficacious and commercially attractive proprietary products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain access to gene transfer technology on commercially reasonable terms;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain required regulatory approvals;
--+--------------------------------------


• | attract and retain qualified scientific and product development personnel;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enter into collaborative and strategic partnerships with others, including our competitors, to develop our technology and product candidates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain and enforce patents, licenses or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | formulate, manufacture, market and sell any product that we develop;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | develop and maintain products that reach the market first and are technologically superior to or are of lower cost than other products in the market; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recruit subjects into our clinical trials in a timely fashion.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

MANUFACTURING
 We rely on contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our preclinical and clinical product candidates in accordance with FDA and EMA mandated regulations, also known as current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs.  We employ a technical operations staff in the areas of process development, analytical development, quality control, quality assurance, project management, and manufacturing to facilitate appropriate oversight of our CMOs, support of our regulatory filings and execution of clinical trials.  In 2017, we expanded our services agreement with Brammer Bio MA, LLC, or Brammer, to provide dedicated capacity to supply our preclinical and clinical programs. Additionally, we plan to build a cGMP manufacturing facility at our new corporate headquarters in Brisbane, CA. This facility will be designed to manufacture of Phase 1/2 clinical trial supplies for our pipeline programs. We believe this balanced approach to manufacturing, investing in internal capacity/capabilities while strengthening our commitment to external capacity, will enable us to meet our anticipated pipeline needs.
 We currently leverage two distinct manufacturing platforms: AAV vector production for our genome editing and gene therapy product candidates and HSPC modification for our cell therapy product candidates. We use a commercial scale baculovirus manufacturing platform to manufacture AAV vectors for genome editing and gene therapy, with each AAV vector packaging a different transgene specific to the target indication or ZFN. The manufacturing process for our HSPC cell therapy product candidates utilizes the patient’s own HSPCs. These HSPCs are transfected using mRNA to produce ZFNs that target specific DNA sites, resulting in modified HSPCs. 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products including gene therapy products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulations and guidance implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologic products. Applications to the FDA are required before conducting human clinical testing of biologic products. Additionally, each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product candidate is reviewed by the FDA and, in limited instances the National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, through its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biologic products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and 
 22

foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
 U.S. Biologic Products Development Process
 Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND exemption, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless FDA objects within 30 days;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s GCP regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application (“BLA”) for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually must complete some long‑term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documents must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or the OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions, not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines, voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public.
 23

The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non‑compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
 Human Clinical Trials Under an IND
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
 Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or their legal representative, reviews and approves the study protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving recombinant DNA also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research that utilizes recombinant DNA at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
 Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1. The biologic product candidate initially is introduced into a small number of human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. Phase 1 clinical trials of gene therapies are typically conducted in patients rather than healthy volunteers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a biologic product. In Phase 3 studies, the biologic product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the potency and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post‑approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long‑term safety follow‑up.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA.
 Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for: serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other trials, in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for 
 24

human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life‑threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
 The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy‑related delayed adverse events for a 15‑year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire.
 Compliance with cGMP Requirements
 Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA will not approve a BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. The PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for approved biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. 
 The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In that event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth, substantive review of the BLA.
 The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will 
 25

determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product candidate. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements.
 On the basis of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.
 If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post‑marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review standard BLAs in 10 months after the FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
 Post‑approval Requirements
 Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biologic products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post‑approval requirements applicable to biologic products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record‑keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA, together with a release protocol, showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biologic products.
 A sponsor also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off‑label use”). Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 Additional Regulation
 26

Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. See Risk Factors—“Our relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.”
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval, particularly for novel products. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels, for such products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, the payors may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. See Risk Factors—“Even if we are able to commercialize our product candidates, the products may not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors in the United States and in other countries in which we seek to commercialize our products, which could harm our business.”
 EMPLOYEES 
 As of February 15, 2018, we had 182 full-time employees, all of whom are located at our headquarters in Richmond, California. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining organization or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced work stoppages. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
