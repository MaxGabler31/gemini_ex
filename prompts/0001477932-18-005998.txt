GridIron BioNutrients is the owner and has right to intellectual property, including trademark, trade names, images, likenesses and other associated intellectual property, such as the name “Gridion BioNutrients” and related to Timothy Orr.
 
We intend to:

Principal Products
 
Gridiron BioNutrients principal products currently include:
 
Gridiron MVP™ Water Beverage (16.9oz)
 Gridiron MVP™ Concentrate (2oz / 4oz)
 
These products contain a proprietary blend of humic and fulvic acid, trace minerals, probiotics, electrolytes, cannabidiol (CBD) within an alkaline of pH10.
 
Gridiron has secured the rights to this proprietary formulation through its CEO, Timothy Orr. (VERBAL AGREEMENT). Timothy Orr provided the formulation in connection with his receipt of 32,500,000 shares of common stock from the Company.

 
Gridiron has the exclusive right(s) to develop CBD products with this formulation. However, Gridiron is limited to developing only CBD products with this formulation and as such does not have any rights to develop products that do not contain CBD with this formulation.
 
In addition to the Gridiron MVP™ beverage and concentrate Gridiron currently has the following products available to market:
 
Gridiron Salve
 Gridiron Premium Hemp Oil Drops (1oz /2oz)
 Gridiron Premium Hemp Oil Capsules
 
Gridiron executed a 1 month “trial period” Manufacture Distribution Agreement on September 22, 2017 with a manufacturer of high quality CBD for the above mentioned products. The Distribution Agreement allows Gridiron to “White Label” (market and distribute) on a non-exclusive basis the above products under the Gridiron name. The Company anticipates executing a long term Manufacture Agreement with this Company or a similar Company within the next three months.
Distribution of Products
 
Gridiron’s products are currently available for sale on its website http://gridironbionutrients.com. The Company intends to retain a consultant(s) to provide avenues to distribution its products within the next twelve months. However, in order to retain any consultant(s) the Company will require funding and currently the Company does not have the required funding to accomplish this task. If the Company is unable to secure financing; it would likely result in a material loss of any investment made into the Company.
Competition
 
Competition within the cannabidiol (CBD) industry is intense with many well-established companies within the market and numerous start-up companies entering the market. Gridiron intends to brand and market high quality CBD products through both exclusive and non-exclusive strategic alliances that will serve to make the Company a market leader.

In addition to the products described herein the Company intends to add an additional CBD water beverage to its product line within the next 4-5 months. The Company can provide no assurance or guarantee that it will be able to develop and/or maintain any strategic alliances now or in the future or that its anticipated new CBD beverage will be accepted by the market if and when developed. If the Company cannot develop and maintain strategic alliances or be successful with the offer of its CBD products and proposed CBD products it would be a significant material negative impact on the business that could result in a significant loss to any investment made into the Company.
 
Sources of Raw Materials
 
Gridiron MVP™ product(s) contain proprietary blend of nutrients that are sourced from various third parties and formulated into the water beverage and concentrate. If for any reason any of these sources are disrupted and the Company is unable to obtain the raw materials necessary to formulate the Gridiron MVP™ product(s) it would materially impact the business that may result in significant losses. Moreover, the Company will be dependent upon third party bottling facilities for its Gridiron MVP™ product; currently the Company has no arrangements or otherwise with any bottling facility and cannot provide any assurance that a suitable bottling facility can be retained or maintained in the future.
 
The Company currently has a Distribution place for the Gridiron Salve, Gridiron Premium Hemp Oil Drops (1oz /2oz) and Gridiron Premium Hemp Oil Capsules. If there is a disruption with the manufacturer of these products for any reason with the Company, it could result in significant delays and/or the inability to deliver the products to customers which would negatively impact the Company’s business.
 
Strategic Partners
 
The Company intends to develop both exclusive and non-exclusive strategic alliances that promote the Company’s products.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product designs and marks. We do not own any patents.

Government Regulation and Approvals
 
We are not aware of any governmental regulations or approvals needed for any of our products. We do not believe that we are subject to any government regulations relating to the ownership and licensing of our intellectual property.
Federal Controlled Substances Act
 
As of June 2017, there are a total of 29 states, plus the District of Columbia, with legislation passed as it relates to medicinal cannabis. These state laws are in direct conflict with the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as having a high potential for abuse, has no currently-accepted use for medical treatment in the U.S., and lacks acceptable safety for use under medical supervision.
 
These 29 states, and the District of Columbia, have adopted laws that exempt patients who use medicinal cannabis under a physician’s supervision from state criminal penalties. These are collectively referred to as the states that have de-criminalized medicinal cannabis, although there is a subtle difference between de-criminalization and legalization, and each state’s laws are different.
 
The dichotomy between federal and state laws has also limited the access to banking and other financial services by marijuana businesses. Recently the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Treasury issued guidance for banks considering conducting business with marijuana dispensaries in states where those businesses are legal, pursuant to which banks must now file a Marijuana Limited Suspicious Activity Report that states the marijuana business is following the government’s guidelines with regard to revenue that is generated exclusively from legal sales. However, since the same guidance noted that banks could still face prosecution if they provide financial services to marijuana businesses, it has led to the widespread refusal of the banking industry to offer banking services to marijuana businesses operating within state and local laws.
 
In an effort to provide guidance to federal law enforcement, the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) has issued Guidance Regarding Marijuana Enforcement to all United States Attorneys in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General David Ogden on October 19, 2009, in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on June 29, 2011 and in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013. Each memorandum provides that the DOJ is committed to the enforcement of the CSA, but the DOJ is also committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way.
 
The August 29, 2013 memorandum provides updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning marijuana enforcement in light of state laws legalizing medical and recreational marijuana possession in small amounts. The memorandum sets forth certain enforcement priorities that are important to the federal government:
 


· | Distribution of marijuana to children; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Revenue from the sale of marijuana going to criminals; 
· | Diversion of medical marijuana from states where it is legal to states where it is not;
· | Using state authorized marijuana activity as a pretext of other illegal drug activity; 
· | Preventing violence in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; 
· | Preventing drugged driving; 
· | Growing marijuana on federal property; and 
· | Preventing possession or use of marijuana on federal property. 

 
The DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property, but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits.

Based on public statements and reports, we understand that certain aspects of those laws and policies are currently under review, but no official changes have been announced. It is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.
 
Although we do not produces, handle or sell cannabis, and the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical use is permitted in Nevada, and medical and recreational use is permitted in the State of Washington, where our administrative offices are located, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with applicable Nevada and Washington law and regulations. Any changes in federal, state or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect our ability to operate our business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.
