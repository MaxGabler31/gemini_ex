ITEM 1. BUSINESS
INTRODUCTION 
 
Kidoz Inc. (TSXV: KIDZ) is a mobile advertising technology company and owner of the KIDOZ Safe Ad Network (www.kidoz.net) and the Kidoz Publisher Software Development Kit (“SDK”). By developing solutions for app developers to monetize with safe, relevant, and fun ads we help keep the Google and Apple app stores safe and free for children. Our commitment to children’s privacy and safety has created one of the fastest growing mobile networks in the world. Unlike most digital advertising, every campaign on the Kidoz platform is free of location information, device identifiers, behavioural data, and other trackers used by advertisers to identify and track users across the Internet commonly known as IDFA and AAID. Our technology does not rely on any permanent identifiers, and as Google and Apple begin to disallow persistent trackers from being employed by any network (child-directed or not), Kidoz’s strength increases. 
 
Fiscal 2021 saw Kidoz’s growth, profitability, and revenues reach new heights. The Company’s continued and increasing pace of growth is attributed to potent market and consumer forces both from the wider digital economy and also specific to the Kidoz niche of private, safe, and contextual advertising. One of the key factors driving growth is the ever-increasing dominance of mobile usage and mobile entertainment across all age groups. Mobile is now consumers’ preferred choice for entertainment and Kidoz provides a safe and high-performance platform to reach hundreds of millions of consumers on their mobile devices.
 
Kidoz is a dedicated AdTech developer that is completely focused on creating a high-performance mobile ad network. We’ve listened to our advertisers who want safe mobile inventory with the greatest reach and widest variety combined with full-service transparency and brand safety. As a contextual network free of data targeting, we build value and trust with advertisers by facilitating pre-campaign contextual app list planning, live campaign optimizations, and detailed post-campaign reporting and analysis. Our strategy continues to succeed in the dynamic digital advertising environment, and we’re excited to be expanding our team and refining our products to grow even faster in the months and years ahead.
 
The Kidoz network continues to grow in size and now boasts more than double the SDK app adoption than its closest direct mobile ad competitor. Kidoz continues to build value and trust with advertisers who seek private, safe, and contextual advertising. We continue to invest heavily into our systems and technology to increase our network reach and solidify our position as the market leader. The latest Kidoz technology that was released in 2021 has the power to further increase our growth rate and fill the billions of impressions exposed monthly on the Kidoz network.

The most powerful new product is Kidoz’s COPPA compliant programmatic technology solution: Kidoz Connect. This new product release is a unique programmatic solution providing ‘review & monetize’ technology to enable open market ad sourcing at scale. Kidoz Connect creates a safe pipeline of advertising sources to be connected to the Kidoz Contextual Ad Network and funneled to the thousands of apps currently utilizing Kidoz monetization technology.
 
Kidoz has also developed new tools for enabling the growth of performance campaigns on the Kidoz network. Software that facilitates the management, tracking, attribution and reporting of performance app install campaigns have enabled Kidoz to significantly grow this cost-per-install (CPI) business line.
 
Kidoz is recognized globally for safely reaching children under the age of 13 on their mobile devices via the Kidoz Contextual Ad Network. After years of development and growth of the Kidoz mobile platform, the Company has now expanded its offering to include both the teens (13-19) and parents’ markets. Using the enormous reach of the Kidoz SDK, the Kidoz media team can now contextually target the children, teen and parent segments in their favourite gaming and app environments. 
 
Kidoz has a unique sales strategy that empowers more than thirty local and international media agencies to sell the Kidoz mobile advertising inventory created by the Kidoz SDK and Kidoz Connect programmatic solution. Agencies are thrilled with the expansion of the Kidoz technology into the Teen and Parent markets as the opportunities for new business are enormous. The success of our strategy and technology increases the pace of our technical investments and creates further opportunities to accelerate the speed of our growth as we refine our software and systems. Mobile digital media is one of the world’s largest industries and Kidoz is perfectly positioned with the correct team and technology to deliver value to its publishers, advertisers, and investors.
 
Kidoz has recently closed the busiest quarter in Company history. Management is pleased with the Company’s performance in 2021, excited by the trajectory of our technology, and believe that 2022 will be another record year for Kidoz.
 
Kidoz’s mobile products include the Kid Mode Operating System installed on millions of OEM tablets worldwide, Rooplay (www.rooplay.com) the cloud-based EduGame system for kids to learn and play; and Trophy Bingo (www.trophybingo.com), live across mobile platforms.

Product Strategy
 
Kidoz builds and maintains the Kidoz Safe Ad Network, the Kidoz SDK, and the Kidoz Connect Programmatic solution for app developers and global advertisers to reach children and families in a compliant and brand safe way. The Kidoz SDK is the core of the advertising technology that enables Kidoz to have advertising impressions available for sale. The Kidoz proprietary advertising system is compliant with COPPA (“Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule”), GDPR-K (“The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation for children”) and other regulations adopted to protect children in a complex digital world. Kidoz technology is completely proprietary. Kidoz continues to upgrade its advertising systems to be compatible with the latest IAB (“International Advertising Board”) specifications for real-time-bidding, header bidding, and server-to-server direct connections. Our design and implementation of these solutions incorporates a view to their utilization not only in the kids’ marketplace but to the entire advertising market. Programmatic advertising is the use of automated advertising technology to enable media buying and selling as opposed to traditional direct methods of digital advertising which involve humans interfacing to agree to deal terms. Offering a managed programmatic solution of the best mobile advertising inventory is a valuable offering that our agency partners are utilizing with increased frequency and scale.
Marketing & Distribution Strategy
 
Each new app that installs the Kidoz SDK increases our user base and increases the number of available impressions that Kidoz can monetize. The adoption of the Kidoz SDK has been rapid as app developers have few choices when it comes to sources of safe, compliant, and relevant ads for their users. Kidoz has built its brand and reputation as the market leader for safe child and family mobile advertising technology and this has enabled our SDK to become quickly adopted. It is our strategy to invest in our systems and build alliances with the largest software companies in the world. Since Google’s certification of Kidoz and Apple’s updated rules endorsing Kidoz’s methodologies the Company is experiencing unprecedented demand for its safe advertising solutions.
Sales & Pricing Strategy
 
Kidoz has a global sales agency partnership strategy that places local sellers into dozens of national and international markets. In 2021 Kidoz launched campaigns in 58 different countries. Through our direct sales and marketing channels we locate, recruit and sign new international sales houses. As the Kidoz network is a unique advertising platform in the market, it commands high prices and media sales houses aspire to represent the Company. Kidoz has found the agency partnership strategy to be highly effective as once sales houses are recruited and the first few campaigns are delivered with success, repeat customers are established and the value of the region begins to grow. After years of development with this strategy, Kidoz has many established sales houses in the largest economies of the world and is now tasked with increasing the value of each partnership and empowering the sales houses to increase the portion of advertisers’ budgets that is spent with Kidoz. The Kidoz Connect solution has created new opportunities for all of Kidoz’s agency partners as the solution creates inventory for brands who are building awareness with parents and teens in addition to children.
Growth Strategy
 
The Kidoz sales, product, and operational strategies are custom fit to match the favorable regulatory, consumer, and technological trends occurring in the market. It is the Kidoz mission to deliver best-in-class solutions for our advertiser and publisher partners that are compliant with Apple, Google, and strict government data privacy regulations. Kidoz technology is built with privacy as a priority and we champion contextual advertising as a superior method of reaching target consumers. Kidoz publisher partners can monetize with human-curated safe advertising on a global scale and with the knowledge that their users’ data is not compromised.
 
Kidoz is growing at a rapid pace as a result of its core media business and the expansion to include the teen and parent segments. Kidoz growth is also being propelled by a new customer type, the app developer themselves. Kidoz is increasingly utilized as a performance platform for apps to scale their installs and revenues by paying on a cost-per-install (“CPI”) basis. The global app install segment of mobile advertising is estimated to be US$118B in 2022 according to AppsFlyer. Kidoz has launched new software to support this high growth business and the Company expects performance CPI media to be an increasing percentage of overall business. Finally, Kidoz Connect is the latest product release to deliver enhanced value to our advertising partners as the technology enables Kidoz to ingest programmatic campaigns of all types and scale them across the Kidoz network. The Kidoz commercial teams look forward to welcoming many new and existing customers to this new offering as we expand the Kidoz reach within the global digital advertising ecosystem.

Furthermore, while the focus of the Company is the development and expansion of the KIDOZ Safe Ad Network, we are investigating options to use our technology to expand into new markets, either through new connections to the wider mobile advertising market, or via synergistic M&A.
 
Kidoz Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”)
 
Kidoz’s mobile products includes the Kid Mode Operating System (“OS”) installed on millions of OEM tablets worldwide. The Company earns license fees based on the OEM agreements dependent on the number of devices the Kidoz Kid Mode OS is installed. 
Rooplay
 
The Company owns Rooplay (www.rooplay.com) the cloud-based EduGame system for kids to play multiple games to learn and play. The platform is live on the Google’s Android system and has stand-alone games available on Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android systems.
Trophy Bingo
 
The Company has the social bingo games Trophy Bingo which is available on Apple’s iOS, Google’s Android and Amazon Android systems. Revenue is generated in the games via in-app purchases and advertising.
OPERATIONS 
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 32 consultants, employees and independent contractors throughout the world including fourteen full-time employees in Canada and Israel. Since 2006 it has been, and continues to be, the Company’s objective to control its costs by retaining consultants, as needed, to provide special expertise in developing internal strategic, marketing, accounting and technical services. None of our employees or consultants are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relationship with our employees and consultants is good.
 
We are substantially dependent upon the continued services and performance of J. M. Williams, Co-Chief Executive Officer; Eldad Ben Tora, Co-Chief Executive Officer and T. M. Williams, Executive Chairman. The loss of the services of these key individuals would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not carry any key man life insurance on any individuals.
 
Competition
 
Kidoz competes with other advertising technology providers that offer safe, COPPA compliant, products. These companies include Super Awesome and Google’s Admob. However, these competitors are not direct threats to Kidoz as their operations and strategies are quite different. For instance, Super Awesome, who maintains a COPPA SDK, sells a variety of media types and technologies unrelated to mobile inventory which is core to Kidoz. As a result, Super awesome is one of Kidoz largest customers. While on the other hand, Google’s Admob SDK is focused on mobile inventory, but is not human curated for child safety. As the technology barriers are high to enter the market with a mobile advertising network, few competitors exist for Kidoz. Kidoz offers a highly customized and targeted offering to advertisers that management believes will enable the Company to grow and succeed in the market.
