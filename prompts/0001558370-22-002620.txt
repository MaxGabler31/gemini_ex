Item 1. Business
​
Background 
​
Plug is building an end-to-end green hydrogen ecosystem, from green hydrogen production, storage and delivery to energy generation through mobile or stationary applications, to help its customers meet their business goals and decarbonize the environment. In creating the first commercially viable market for hydrogen fuel cell technology, the Company has deployed more than 50,000 fuel cell systems for forklifts and more than 150 fueling stations customers use daily to fill their forklift trucks. Plug intends to deliver its green hydrogen solutions directly to its customers, and through joint venture partners into multiple environments, including material handling, e-mobility, power generation, and industrial applications. 
 ​
We are focused on proton exchange membrane (“PEM”), fuel cell and fuel processing technologies, fuel cell/battery hybrid technologies, and associated hydrogen and green hydrogen generation, storage and dispensing infrastructure. A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that combines hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and heat without combustion. In support of the market growth and its own ambitions, Plug is building a state-of-the-art gigafactory to produce electrolyzers stacks and fuel cells.
​
Plug delivers end-to-end clean hydrogen and zero-emissions fuel cell solutions for supply chain and logistics applications, on-road electric vehicles, the stationary power market, and more. Our largest market today is material handling; we support customers at multi-shift high volume manufacturing and high throughput distribution sites where we believe our products and services provide a unique combination of productivity, flexibility, and environmental benefits. 
​
Additionally, we manufacture and sell fuel cell products to replace batteries and diesel generators in stationary backup power applications. These products have proven valuable with telecommunications, transportation, and utility customers as robust, reliable, and sustainable power solutions. 
​
We were organized as a corporation in the State of Delaware on June 27, 1997. 
​
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “Company,” “Plug,” “we,” “our” or “us” as used herein refer to Plug Power Inc. and its subsidiaries.

​
Competition
​
We experience competition in all areas of our business. The markets we address for motive and backup power are characterized by the presence of well-established battery and combustion generator products. We also face competition from integrated gas companies, and companies offering Steam Methane Reformers and electrolyzers. We believe the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include product features, including size and weight, relative price and performance, lifetime operating cost, including any maintenance and support, product quality and reliability, safety, ease of use, foot print, rapid integration with existing equipment and processes, customer support design innovation, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation.
​
Intellectual Property 
​
We believe that neither we nor our competitors can achieve a significant proprietary position on the basic technologies currently used in PEM fuel cell systems. However, we believe the design and integration of our system and system components, as well as some of the low-cost manufacturing processes that we have developed, are intellectual property that can be protected. Our intellectual property portfolio covers, among other things: fuel cell components that reduce manufacturing part count; fuel cell system designs that lend themselves to mass manufacturing; improvements to fuel cell system efficiency, reliability and system life; and control strategies, such as added safety protections and operation under extreme conditions. In general, our employees are party to agreements providing that all inventions, whether 

10




patented or not, made or conceived while being our employee, which are related to or result from work or research that we perform, will remain our sole and exclusive property.
​
We have a total of 105 issued patents currently active with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), expiring between 2022 and 2039. At the close of 2021, we had 16 U.S. patent applications pending. Additionally, we have 22 trademarks registered with the USPTO expiring between 2022 and 2032, and three trademark applications pending.
​
Government Regulation
​
Our fuel cell, electrolyzer, and hydrogen products, their installations, and the operations at our facilities are subject to oversight and regulation at the international level, as well as federal, state and local levels in accordance with statutes and ordinances relating to, among others, building codes, fire codes, public safety, electrical and gas pipeline connections and hydrogen siting. The level of regulation may depend, in part, upon where a system is located – both domestically and abroad. 
​
In addition, product safety standards have been established by the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”), covering the overall fuel cell system. The class 1, 2 and 3 GenDrive products are designed with the intent of meeting the requirements of UL 2267 “Fuel Cell Power Systems for Installation in Industrial Electric Trucks” and NFPA 505 “Fire Safety Standard for Powered Industrial Trucks.” The hydrogen tanks used in these systems have been either certified to ANSI/CSA NGV2-2007 “Compressed Natural Gas Vehicle Fuel Containers” or ISO/TS 15869 “Gaseous hydrogen and hydrogen blends—Land vehicle fuel tanks.” We will continue to design our GenDrive products to meet ANSI and/or other applicable standards. We certified several models of Class 1, 2 and 3 GenDrive products to the requirements of the CE mark with guidance from a European certified body. The hydrogen tanks used in these systems are certified to the Pressure Equipment Directive by a European certified body. The GenFuel hydrogen storage and dispensing products are designed with the intent of meeting the requirements of NFPA 2 “Hydrogen Technologies Code.”We are also subject to standards as applied to the design of our electrolyzer products, both domestically and abroad. Such standards include, but are not limited to, “Hydrogen Generators Using Water Electrolysis” (ISO 22734), “Hydrogen Technologies Code” (NFPA 2), “Explosive Atmospheres” requirements (UL 60079), CE product standards within the European Commission, and AS/NZS standards for our products within each jurisdiction, as applicable. As our Company increasingly expands to new markets and jurisdiction, we also become currently subject to new and different regulations in such jurisdictions. 
​
We are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the use, handling, storage, transportation, disposal and human exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, product safety, and emissions of pollution into the environment, and the remediation of contamination. In addition, certain environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can significantly increase the costs of our operations. Violations of environmental laws and regulations can subject us to additional costs and expenses, including defense costs and expenses and civil and criminal penalties. Environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and compliance costs are significant and will continue to be significant in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that existing or future environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our business. We believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental rules and regulations in all material respects.
​
As our business expands – particularly as part of our green hydrogen production strategy – we will continue to evaluate the potential impact such provisions will have on our business, as applied to each relevant jurisdiction in which we conduct business. We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect in the foreseeable future on our business or markets that we serve, or on our results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. However, there is no guarantee that any such legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords will be favorable to our business. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.
​
Other than these requirements, at this time we do not know what additional requirements, if any, each jurisdiction will impose on our products or their installation. We also do not know the extent to which any new regulations may impact our ability to distribute, install and service our products. As we continue distributing our systems to our target markets, the 

11




federal, state, local or foreign government entities may seek to impose regulations or competitors may seek to influence regulations through lobbying efforts.
​
See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a description of these governmental regulations and other material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position. 
​
Raw Materials and Suppliers 
​
Most components essential to our business are generally available from multiple sources. We believe there are component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to us could have a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition. We are mitigating these potential risks by introducing alternate system architectures which we expect will allow us to diversify our supply chain with multiple fuel cell stack and air supply component vendors. We are also working closely with these vendors and other key suppliers on coordinated product introduction plans, strategic inventories, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. Historically, we have not experienced significant delays in the supply or availability of our key raw materials or components provided by our suppliers, however, we have seen a price increase primarily due to the increased cost of freight. 
​
Research and Development 
​
Because the fuel cell industry is still in the early state of adoption, our ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. We continue to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of cost, size, weight, and in supporting service solutions in order to drive further commercialization.
​
We may also expand the range of our product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third-party business and technology. Our research and development expense totaled $64.8 million, $27.8 million, and $15.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We also had cost of research and development contract revenue of $0.2 million, during the year ended December 31, 2019. We had no cost for research and development contract revenue in 2021 and 2020. These expenses represent the cost of research and development programs that are partially funded under cost reimbursement research and development arrangements with third parties and are reported within other cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.
​
Human Capital Resources 
​
As of December 31, 2021, we had 2,449 employees, of which 200 are temporary employees, with 2,105 located in the United States and 344 located outside of the United States. In order to facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Plug a safe, rewarding, and challenging workplace with competitive salaries. 
​
Our employees are critical to the Company’s growth, expansion and success, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be positive.

​
Engagement
​
We believe that listening to our employees is key to providing a work environment that is inclusive and results in a motivated and engaged workforce. We regularly conduct anonymous employee surveys to understand where we have opportunities to improve and solicit ideas from employees. Several initiatives have been launched, such as focus groups with Human Resources and leadership and bi-monthly small group sessions with our Chief Executive Officer to provide a platform for employees to share honest feedback in an open-forum.
​
Transparency and communication are key elements of the Company’s culture. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a weekly all employee meeting led by our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President of Human Resources provide information on safety measures as relates to the Company’s practice on COVID-19. The meeting also includes a timely business topic delivered by a subject matter expert within the Company. This provides timely information and opportunities for upcoming leaders to develop their presentation skills, and aims to align the workforce with the Company’s vision, strategy, and objectives. An open question and answer session is hosted as part of the weekly employee meeting by the Chief Executive Officer, in which employees are encouraged to submit questions and can do so anonymously if they prefer.
​
Community Involvement
​
We recognize the importance of supporting our local communities as we continue to grow as an organization. Our efforts not only provide value back to our community members but enables our employees to give back, helping them to meet their own values. We also facilitate employee donations through the United Way, supporting its four pillar objectives helping our communities, which includes the (1) ability to meet basic needs, (2) education leading to a good job, (3) income providing financial security, and (4) an ability to gain and maintain health. This system enables our employees to donate money to causes they care about in their individual communities through payroll deductions.
​
Performance Management and Incentives
​
Our full-year performance management process begins with setting annual goals for the Company, which guide the development of functional and individual employee goals. Employees and their managers are accountable for goals and must review performance against the goals on an ongoing basis. We provide employee base wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, and location. Additionally, we believe that individual performance and the results of the Company are directly linked to payment of annual short-term incentive compensation. Employees may also be granted equity compensation awards with multi-year vesting for retention.

COVID-19 Health Measures
​
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in March 2020, state governments—including those in New York and Washington, where our manufacturing facilities are located—issued orders requiring businesses that do not conduct essential services to temporarily close their physical workplaces to employees and customers. As a result, we put in place a number of protective measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, which included the canceling of all commercial air travel and all other non-critical travel, requesting that employees limit non-essential personal travel, eliminating all but essential third-party access to our facilities, enhancing our facilities’ janitorial and sanitary procedures, encouraging employees to work from home to the extent their job function enabled them to do so, encouraging the use of virtual employee meetings, and providing staggered shifts and social distancing measures for those employees associated with manufacturing and service operations. 
​
In June 2021, in accordance with revised CDC guidelines and where permitted by state law, employees who were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and have been through Plug’s certification process, were permitted to enter Plug facilities without a face covering. Individuals inside Plug facilities who did not wish to go through the certification process were required to wear proper face coverings and continued to maintain social distancing of six feet or greater. In states where the guidelines for face coverings was still government mandated, Plug complied with the state and local jurisdictions

and enforced face mask usage, as well as social distancing at our sites. In early August 2021, we adjusted our guidance as a result of an influx of COVID-19 cases and began requiring all employees and visitors regardless of vaccination status to wear a face-covering at all times while within a Plug facility, and strongly encouraged social distancing. We continue to provide enhanced janitorial and sanitary procedures, encourage employees to work from home to the extent their job function enables them to do so, and encourage the use of virtual employee meetings. Additionally, starting on January 3, 2022, all U.S. based employees, including temporary employees are required to either be vaccinated against COVID-19, or be subject to weekly COVID-19 testing in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19 and continue to protect our workforce. Based on the decrease of COVID-19 cases globally, all vaccinated employees and visitors will no longer be required to wear a face-covering while within Plug facilities as of February 15, 2022. Unvaccinated employees and visitors will continue to be required to wear a face-covering until further notice. Additionally, we will continue to monitor the trends and the developments of COVID-19, and adjust our health measure as needed to ensure the safety and well-being of our workforce.

COVID-19 Update
​
We cannot predict at this time the full extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business, results, and financial condition, which will depend on many factors. We are staying in close communication with our manufacturing facilities, employees, customers, suppliers, and partners, and acting to mitigate the impact of this dynamic and evolving situation, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so. Many of the parts for our products are sourced from suppliers in China and the manufacturing situation in China remains variable. Supply chain disruptions could reduce the availability of key components, increase prices or both, as the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant challenges for global supply chains resulting primarily in transportation delays.  These transportation delays have caused incremental freight charges, which have negatively impacted our results of operations. We expect that these challenges will continue to have an impact on our businesses for the foreseeable future.
​
We continue to take proactive steps to limit the impact of these challenges and are working closely with our suppliers and transportation vendors to ensure availability of products and implement other cost savings initiatives. In addition, we continue to invest in our supply chain to improve its resilience with a focus on automation, dual sourcing of critical components and localized manufacturing when feasible. To date, there has been limited disruption to the availability of our products, though it is possible that more significant disruptions could occur if these supply chain challenges continue.
