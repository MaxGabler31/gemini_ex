Item 1. Business 
Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “the Company,”  “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Alamo Group Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

General

The Company is a leader in the design, manufacture and servicing of high quality vegetation management and infrastructure maintenance equipment for governmental, industrial and agricultural use. The Company’s products include tractor mounted and self-propelled mowers, zero-turn mowers, agricultural implements, tree and branch chippers, forestry/wood recycling equipment, street and parking lot sweepers, leaf and debris collection equipment, pothole patchers, vacuum trucks, hydro-excavation equipment, telescopic boom excavators, and snow removal equipment. The Company emphasizes high quality, cost-effective products for its customers and strives to develop and market innovative products while constantly monitoring and seeking to contain its manufacturing and overhead costs. The Company has a long-standing strategy of supplementing its internal growth through acquisitions of businesses or product lines that currently complement, command, or have the potential to achieve a meaningful share of their niche markets. 
The Company has approximately 4,200 employees and operates a total of 29 plants in North America, South America, Europe, and Australia. The Company sells its products primarily through a network of independent dealers and distributors to governmental end-users, related independent contractors, as well as to the agricultural and commercial turf markets. The primary markets for our products are North America, South America, Europe and Australia.

 The predecessor corporation to Alamo Group Inc. was incorporated in the State of Texas in 1969, as a successor to a business that began selling mowing equipment in 1955, and Alamo Group Inc. was reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 1987.
History
 Since its founding in 1969, the Company has focused on satisfying customer needs through geographic market expansion, product development and refinement, and selected acquisitions. The Company’s first products were based on rotary cutting technology. Through acquisitions, the Company added flail cutting technology in 1983 and sickle-bar cutting technology in 1984. The Company added to its presence in the industrial and governmental vegetation markets with the acquisition of Tiger Corporation (“Tiger”) in late 1994.
 The Company entered the agricultural mowing markets in 1986 with the acquisition of Rhino Products Inc. (“Rhino”), a leading manufacturer in this field. With this acquisition, the Company embarked on a strategy to increase the Rhino dealer distribution network during a period of industry contraction. The addition of M&W Gear Company (“M&W”) in early 1995 allowed the Company to enter into the manufacturing and distribution of tillage equipment, which complements the Rhino distribution network. M&W is part of the vegetation management marketing group. 
 In 1991, the Company began its international expansion with the acquisition of McConnel Ltd. (“McConnel”), a United Kingdom (“U.K.”) manufacturer of vegetation maintenance equipment, principally hydraulic boom-mounted hedge and grass cutters and related parts. Bomford-Turner Ltd. (“Bomford”), also a U.K. company, was acquired in 1993. Bomford is a manufacturer of heavy-duty, tractor-mounted grass and hedge mowing equipment. McConnel and Bomford sell their products to dealers and distributors through their respective sales forces.
 In 1994, the Company acquired Signalisation Moderne Autoroutiere S.A. (“SMA”) located in Orleans, France. SMA manufactures and sells principally a line of heavy-duty, tractor-mounted grass and hedge mowing-equipment and associated replacement parts primarily to departments of the French government. This acquisition, along with the acquisitions of Forges Gorce ("Forges Gorce"), a flail blade manufacturer in France, in 1996 and Rousseau Holdings S.A. (“Rousseau”), a leading French manufacturer of hedge and verge mowers, in 2004, when combined with McConnel and Bomford, has made the Company one of the largest manufacturers in the European market for the kind of vegetation management equipment sold by the Company.
In 1995, the Company expanded its business in the agricultural market with the acquisition of Herschel Corporation (“Herschel”), a manufacturer and distributor of aftermarket farm equipment replacement and wear parts.

Impact of COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19" or "the pandemic") outbreak a global pandemic. COVID-19 has had a material negative impact on public health and the global economy. While direct impacts from the transmission of the disease have caused significant disruptions to our business, these impacts appear to be moderating at the present time. However, the indirect effects of the pandemic, including, among other things, supply chain disruptions, input cost inflation, labor shortages and logistics challenges, all of which materially impacted our business and financial results in 2021, continue to adversely impact our business and we expect these will continue to impact us at least through the first half of 2022.  The longer term impacts of COVID-19 on our business remain uncertain and will depend on certain future developments, including the duration of the pandemic; any adverse impact due to variants of the virus; its impact on market demand for our products; its impact on our employees, customers, and suppliers; the range of government mandated restrictions and other measures; and the success of the deployment of approved COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutic drugs and their effectiveness and rate of adoption. Additional information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business can be found under Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and risks related to COVID-19 can be found under Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Sales and Marketing Strategy

The Company believes that within the U.S. it is a leading supplier to governmental markets, a leading supplier in the U.S. agricultural market, and one of the largest suppliers in the European market for its key niche product offerings. The Company’s products are sold through the Company’s various marketing organizations and extensive worldwide dealer and distributor networks under the Gradall®, VacAll®, Super Products®, Rivard®, Alamo Industrial®, Terrain King®, Tiger®, Herder®, Conver®, Roberine®, Votex®, Schwarze®, NiteHawk®, ODB™, Henke®, Tenco®,  Wausau®,  Everest®, H.P. Fairfield™, R.P.M. Tech™, Morbark®, Rayco®,Denis Cimaf®, Boxer®, Bush Hog®, Rhino®, RhinoAg®, M&W®, Dixie Chopper®, Herschel®, Schulte®, Fieldquip®, Santa Izabel™, McConnel®, Bomford®, Spearhead™, Twose™, SMA®, Forges Gorce™, Rousseau® , Timberwolf® , and Wolftrack® trademarks (some with related designs) as well as other trademarks and trade names. 
Products and Distribution Channels
At the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company began reporting operating results on the basis of two new segments, namely, the Vegetation Management Division and the Industrial Equipment Division. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company had been reporting its operating results on the basis of two segments which were the Industrial Division and Agricultural Division. The Vegetation Management Division includes all of the operations of the former Agricultural Division plus the mowing and forestry/tree care operations that were previously part of the former Industrial Division, including the Company's recently acquired Morbark and Dutch Power business units. The Industrial Equipment Division includes the Company’s vocational truck business and other industrial operations such as excavators, vacuum trucks, street sweepers, and snow removal equipment. We believe the realignment of our two divisions provides greater potential to capture synergies in cross-branding, distribution, product development, supply chain management and logistics. The two divisions are also more balanced in scale and scope giving the Company two strong platforms for ongoing development through a mix of organic growth and
acquisitions.

Replacement Parts
The Company derives a significant portion of its revenues from sales of replacement parts for each of its wholegoods lines. Replacement parts represented approximately 20%, 21% and 19% of the Company’s total sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Replacement parts generally are more profitable and less cyclical than wholegoods.
Product Development
The Company’s ability to provide innovative responses to customer needs, to develop and manufacture new products, and to enhance existing product lines is important to its success. The Company continually conducts research and development activities in an effort to improve existing products and develop new products. As of December 31, 2021, the Company employed 268 people in its various engineering departments, 164 of whom are degreed engineers and the balance of whom are support staff. Amounts expended on research and development activities were approximately $11.7 million in 2021, $12.4 million in 2020 and $12.0 million in 2019. As a percentage of sales, research & development was approximately 0.9% in 2021, 1.1% in 2020 and 1.1% in 2019, and is expected to continue at similar levels in 2022. 
Seasonality
 The Company’s unit sales are fairly constant quarter to quarter. However, replacement part sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, because a substantial number of the Company’s products are used for maintenance activities such as vegetation maintenance, highway right-of-way maintenance, construction, and street and parking lot sweeping. Usage of this equipment is typically lower in harsh weather. The Company utilizes an annual twelve-month sales forecast provided by the Company’s marketing departments which is updated quarterly in order to develop a production plan for its manufacturing facilities. In addition, many of the Company’s marketing departments attempt to equalize demand for products throughout the calendar year by offering seasonal sales programs which may provide additional incentives, including discounts and extended payment terms.
Competition
The Company’s products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. The principal competitive factors are price, quality, availability, service and reputation. The Company competes with several large national and international companies that offer a broad range of equipment and replacement parts, as well as with numerous small, privately-held manufacturers and suppliers of a limited number of products, mainly on a regional basis. Some of the Company’s competitors are significantly larger than the Company and have substantially greater financial and other resources at their disposal. The Company believes that it is able to compete successfully in its markets by effectively managing its manufacturing costs, offering high quality products, developing and designing innovative products and, to some extent, avoiding direct competition with significantly larger potential competitors. There can be no assurance that the Company’s competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products competitive with the Company’s products or that new competitors with greater resources will not enter the Company’s markets.
Unfilled Orders
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had unfilled customer orders of $800.8 million compared to $354.1 million at December 31, 2020. Management expects that substantially all of the Company’s unfilled orders as of December 31, 2021 will be shipped during fiscal year 2022. The amount of unfilled orders at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including manufacturing and shipping schedules which, in most instances, are dependent on the Company’s seasonal sales programs and the requirements of its customers. It is possible that unanticipated effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply chain disruptions or customer issues, could continue to cause delays in delivery or an inability to complete unfilled customer orders. The Company’s orders are subject to cancellation at any time before shipment; therefore, a comparison of unfilled orders from period to period 
is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of future actual shipments. No single customer or group of customers is responsible for 10% or more of the aggregate revenue of the Company or of a segment of the Company.
Sources of Supply
The principal raw materials used by the Company include steel, other metal components, hydraulic hoses, paint and tires. During 2021, the raw materials needed by the Company were available from a variety of sources in adequate quantities and at prevailing market prices.

While the Company manufactures many of the parts for its products, a significant percentage of parts, including most drivelines, gearboxes, industrial engines, and hydraulic components, are purchased from outside suppliers which manufacture to the Company’s specifications. In addition, the Company, through its subsidiaries, purchases tractors and truck chassis as a number of the Company’s products are mounted and shipped with a tractor or truck chassis. Tractors and truck chassis are generally available, but some delays in receiving tractors or truck chassis can occur throughout the year. The Company sources its purchased goods from international and domestic suppliers. No one supplier is responsible for supplying more than 10% of the principal raw materials or purchased goods used by the Company. 

Patents, Trademarks and Trade Names

 The Company owns various U.S. and international patents, trademarks and trade names. While the Company considers its patents, trademarks and trade names to be advantageous to its business, it is not dependent on any single patent, trademark, trade name or group of patents, trademarks, or trade names. The net book value of patents, trademarks and trade names was $84.8 million and $89.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Environmental and Other Governmental Regulations
 Like other manufacturers, the Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations including those relating to climate change; emissions to air, including Tier 4 or similar engine emission regulations; discharges to water; restrictions placed on water usage and water availability; product and associated packaging; use of certain chemicals; restricted substances, including "conflict minerals" disclosure rules; import and export compliance, including country of origin certification requirements; worker and product user health and safety; energy efficiency; product life-cycles; outdoor noise laws; and the generation, use, handling, labeling, collection, management, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, and other regulated materials. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the California Air Resources Board ("CARB"), and similar regulators in other U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we sell our products have emission requirements setting maximum emission standards for certain equipment. In addition to the the EPA's implementation of Tier 4 emission requirements applicable to diesel engines, China, the European Union ("EU") and and the United Kingdom also have adopted similar regulations, and similar emission regulations are also being considered in other markets in which we sell our products. CARB continues to propose and discuss implementation of zero emissions equipment regulations that will likely create increasingly stringent requirements on exhaust and other emissions from some of the products we manufacture.
The U.S. federal government, several U.S. states, and certain international markets where we sell our products, including the EU and some EU member countries have introduced product life-cycle laws, rules, or regulations, which are intended to reduce waste and environmental and human health impact, and require manufacturers to label, collect, dispose, and recycle certain products, including some of our products, at the end of their useful life. These include, among other laws and regulations: (i) the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals directive or similar substance level laws, rules, or regulations that require notification of use of certain chemicals, or ban or restrict the use of certain chemicals; (ii) California Proposition 65 and other product substance restriction laws, some of which require certain labeling of products; (iii) energy efficiency laws, rules, or regulations, which are intended to reduce the use and inefficiencies associated with energy and natural resource consumption and require specified efficiency ratings and capabilities for certain products; (iv) conflict minerals laws, such as those contained in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules 
promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), which require specific procedures for the determination and disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as "conflict minerals," which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries; and (v) supply chain transparency laws and regulations addressing modern slavery and human trafficking.
The Company is also subject to various other federal, state, and local laws affecting its business, as well as a variety of regulations relating to such matters as working conditions, equal employment opportunities, and product safety, including National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reporting. In addition, a variety of laws regulate the Company’s contractual relationships with its dealers, some of which impose restrictive standards on the relationship between the Company and its dealers, including events of default, grounds for termination, non-renewal of dealer contracts, and equipment repurchase requirements. 
We believe we have maintained compliance with existing laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business and will continue to do so. While we believe there will be some additional costs to our business as a result of the increasing level of regulation applicable to our business activities, we do not believe that the costs associated with our compliance efforts will have a material impact on our financial results. 
Human Capital Resources and Management 
 We recognize that the success of our Company is dependent upon the talents and dedication of our people, and we are committed to investing in their success. Our Vice-President of Corporate Human Resources is responsible for developing and executing our human resources strategy together with our President and Chief Executive Officer and the other members of the Company's management team. Our Chief Executive Officer and Vice-President of Human Resources regularly update our Board of Directors regarding the status of our human resources activities. Among the key elements of our human resources strategy are the following:
Focus on Health and Safety: Employee health and safety is of paramount importance to us. We believe it is our responsibility to maintain a safe and healthy workplace in each of our locations and to make continuous improvements in this area. We do this by embedding safety into every level of the organization as one of our core values. Our approach is proactive and preventative. Regular safety meetings are held at our plants on an ongoing basis. Every location offers frequent safety training programs to all employees and leverages safety committees who conduct safety audits to identify and remove potential issues. We ensure that safety performance is tracked, aggregated, and reviewed on an ongoing basis. Our corporate technical affairs and safety team collects data on recordable injury rates, severe injury rates, and near misses from each Alamo Group operating company, and conducts root cause analysis with corrective action plans to prevent future occurrences. This data is reviewed monthly by the executive leadership team and shared with the Company's Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented, and continue to adhere to, certain rigorous and meaningful safety measures recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, and federal, state, local, and foreign authorities that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, customers, and suppliers. This led to the adoption of various measures including COVID-19 case tracking and quarantining where and when necessary, mandating face coverings when required by local rules and regulations (except where hazardous), regular sanitization, reconfiguration of workstations to allow for appropriate distancing, expanding the use of internal video meetings and installation of related technology, minimizing travel, and implementing remote work assignments, amongst other actions.
Employee Engagement and Talent Development: We focus on attracting, developing, and retaining a team of highly talented and motivated employees. Our key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within, so they are “ready now” when career opportunities arise, and when we recruit externally to select candidates with future stretch potential. We provide all employees a wide range of professional development experiences, both formal and informal, at all stages in their careers. Our formal offerings include tuition reimbursement, a diverse curriculum of learning programs, leadership development experiences, vocational and trade skills training, and external partnerships across the globe. The Company's focus on supervisor and manager development and a culture of promoting a diverse, inclusive, and respectful workplace supports our ability to attract, engage, retain, and motivate industry-leading talent to meet our customer’s needs and sustain the Company’s growth. Formal welder training, apprenticeships, and local partnerships with vocational training programs, junior colleges, and high schools ensure that our operating companies continue to attract and grow their critical manufacturing skills. The Company’s emphasis on our core competencies, including Leading People and Leading Change, continues to favorably impact our succession planning and employee retention with below industry average annual turnover rates. In January of 2022, we implemented The Alamo Group Learning & Development Academy, a new talent development program which focuses on building and strengthening the leadership capabilities of our management teams and also offers technical skills training for our production floor employees. Many programs are available on-demand to 
manufacturing supervisors, which offers development opportunities to those with direct oversight of the people building our products. Training is easily accessible both to employees who work on-site as well as those who work in remote and hybrid environments. Virtual, in-person and on-campus programs are offered to encourage cross-location and cross-functional networking and sharing of ideas that foster and support our culture of continuous improvement. 
Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion: We recognize, value, and respect the individual differences of our employees and believe that a diverse set of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives is crucial to our ability to continue to innovate, collaborate, and meet the needs of our global workforce and customers. Accordingly, we are committed to encouraging and fostering an inclusive culture where diversity and individual differences are accepted, respected, and valued so that employees feel empowered to contribute fully to the Company's ongoing success. To promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace, we dedicate people and resources to promote an inclusive environment through policies and training. We also promote our career opportunities to a wide network of organizations and job boards that can help us source diverse candidate pools. We actively volunteer and engage in local community projects and contribute donations to charitable organizations. We build strategies and implement tactics that will attract and maintain a diverse workforce, positively impacting the communities and markets in which our employees live and work. Initiatives include but are not limited to increased diversity and inclusion training that increases awareness and reinforces respect in the workplace, as well as building partnerships with organizations like Women in Manufacturing and The National Diversity Council. 
Compensation and Benefits: We conduct regular assessments of our pay and benefit practices to help ensure that our people are compensated fairly and competitively. We also devote significant resources to management and employee training and development, including tuition assistance for career-enhancing academic and professional programs. In addition to salaries, our compensation programs, which vary by country and region, can include annual bonuses, profit sharing, stock-based compensation awards, company-sponsored retirement savings plans with employee matching opportunities (or similar local retirement benefits), healthcare and insurance benefits, dependent care and flexible savings accounts, paid time off such as vacation and holidays, sick pay, disability pay and family leave, flexible work schedules, wellness and employee assistance programs for mental health, self-improvement, legal and financial services, service anniversary awards, tuition assistance and dependent college scholarships, and discounts on products and services. 
Labor Agreements: As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 4,200 employees. In the U.S. the Company has a collective bargaining agreement at its Gradall plant which covers 174 employees and will expire on April 14, 2024. In Canada the Tenco bargaining agreement covers 109 employees and expires on December 31, 2025; RPM has an agreement covering 4 employees which expires on February 1, 2025; and Everest has a collective bargaining agreement covering 70 employees which will expire on November 30, 2023. In the Company’s European locations, all employees are covered by the European Works Council agreements. McConnel, Bomford, Spearhead, AMS-UK, SMA, Faucheux, Forges Gorce, Rousseau, Rivard, and Alamo Group The Netherlands have various collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 969 employees. The Company considers its employee relations to be satisfactory.
