ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Gannett Co., Inc. ("Gannett", "we", "us", "our", or the "Company") is a subscription-led and digitally-focused media and marketing solutions company committed to empowering communities to thrive. Gannett operates a scalable, data-driven media platform that aligns with our consumer and digital marketing trends. We aim to be the premier source for clarity, connections, and solutions within our communities. Our strategy is focused on driving audience growth and engagement by delivering deeper content experiences to our consumers, while offering the products and marketing expertise our advertisers desire. The execution of this strategy is expected to enable us to continue our evolution from a more traditional print media business to a digitally-focused content platform. 
Our current portfolio of media assets includes USA TODAY, local media organizations in 45 states in the U.S., and Newsquest, a wholly-owned subsidiary operating in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") with more than 120 local media brands. We also operate a digital marketing solutions company branded LOCALiQ, that provides a cloud-based platform of products to enable small and medium businesses ("SMBs") to accomplish their marketing goals. In addition, we run what we believe is the largest media-owned events business in the U.S., USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures.
Through USA TODAY, our local property network, and Newsquest, we deliver high-quality, trusted content with a commitment to balanced, unbiased journalism, where and when consumers want to engage with it on virtually any device or platform. Additionally, we have strong relationships with hundreds of thousands of local and national businesses in both our U.S. and U.K. markets due to our large local and national sales forces and a robust advertising and digital marketing solutions product suite. The Company reports in two segments, Publishing and Digital Marketing Solutions. We also have a Corporate and other category that includes activities not directly attributable to a specific reportable segment and includes broad corporate functions such as legal, human resources, accounting, analytics, finance, and marketing. A full description of our reportable segments is included in Note 15 — Segment reporting of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company has made both internal and external investments in data, product, content, and marketing to align with the shift in spending habits to digital products by both consumers and marketers. In 2021, total digital revenues, which includes Digital advertising and marketing services revenues, Digital-only circulation revenues, and Digital syndication and affiliate revenues, were $1.028 billion, or 32% of our total revenues. As of December 31, 2021 our U.S. media network, which includes USA TODAY and our local properties, had approximately 4,220 journalists. We continue to invest in unique, premium content as we seek to accelerate growth of a subscription-led digital business model, anchored on high-quality, original, impactful journalism. Our U.S. media network averaged 141 million(1) unique visitors monthly during 2021, who accessed content through desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets. In the U.K., Newsquest is a publishing and digital leader with approximately 626 journalists as of December 31, 2021 and a network of websites that averaged over 40 million unique visitors monthly during 2021. As of December 31, 2021 we had approximately 1.6 million digital-only subscribers, up 49% year over year.
Until November 19, 2019, our corporate name was New Media Investment Group Inc. ("Legacy New Media") and Gannett Co., Inc. was a separate publicly traded company. On November 19, 2019, New Media completed its acquisition of Gannett Co., Inc. (which was renamed Gannett Media Corp. and is referred to as "Legacy Gannett"). In connection with the acquisition, New Media changed its name to Gannett Co., Inc. and assumed Legacy Gannett's ticker symbol "GCI" (having previously traded under "NEWM"). In addition, effective at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on December 31, 2020, the Company's former management agreement (the "Former Management Agreement") with FIG LLC (the "Former Manager") was terminated. 
We believe that a number of factors and industry trends have, and will continue to, present risks and challenges to our business. For a detailed discussion of certain factors that could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, see "Item 1A — Risk Factors."
Publishing Segment
 Our Publishing segment is comprised of the following core products:
•Over 550 Digital media brands, including USA TODAY, Sports+, and our local property network in the U.S. and the U.K. exceeding 1.6 million digital-only subscribers as of December 31, 2021;
•USA TODAY Group which includes our sports network (owned and operated as well as affiliates) and Reviewed.com (an affiliate marketing business); 
•230 daily print media brands, including our local property network in the U.S. and USA TODAY, with total paid circulation of over 1.9 million and Sunday circulation of 2.2 million as of December 31, 2021; 
•249 weekly print media brands (published up to three times per week) with total circulation of approximately 1.4 million at December 31, 2021; 
•292 locally-focused websites, which extend our businesses onto digital platforms;
•123 daily and weekly news media brands, as well as over 80 magazines in the U.K. as of December 31, 2021; and
•Our community events platform, USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures.
In addition to our core products, we also opportunistically produce niche publications that address specific local market interests such as recreation, sports, healthcare, and real estate. Many of our publications are located in small and mid-size markets where we are often the primary provider of comprehensive local market news and information. Our content is primarily devoted to topics we believe are highly relevant and of interest to our audiences, such as local news and politics, community and regional events, health and wellness, youth sports, local schools, obituaries, and crime news.
More than 80% of our daily media brands have been published for more than 100 years. We believe the longevity of our publications demonstrates the value and relevance of the local information we provide and has created a strong foundation of reader loyalty and a highly-recognized media brand name in each community we serve. 
Since its introduction in 1982, USA TODAY has been a cornerstone of the national media landscape under its recognizable and respected brand. It also serves as the foundation for our newsroom network, the USA TODAY NETWORK, which allows for content sharing capabilities across our local and national markets. Since 1918, our USA TODAY NETWORK newsrooms have won 96 Pulitzer Prizes. Most recently, the Indianapolis Star won the 2021 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting, alongside partners at The Marshall Project, AL.com and the Invisible Institute, for a year-long investigation that found police dogs attack people suspected of petty crimes, bystanders and even officers, leaving many with life-altering injuries. Also, in 2021, the Louisville Courier Journal was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in two categories, Breaking News and Public Service. This marks five Pulitzer Prize winners and four finalists awarded to Gannett journalists in the last four years. 
The scale of our consumer audience across the Publishing segment makes us an attractive marketing partner to various local and national businesses trying to reach consumers. We reach 1 in 2 adults in the U.S., led by USA TODAY and amplified by local media brands within the USA TODAY NETWORK. We are the leading news media publisher in the U.S. in terms of circulation and have the sixth largest digital audience in the News and Information category, based on December 2021 Comscore Media Metrix®; per those metrics, our content reaches more people digitally than Fox News Digital Network, New York Times Digital, Insider Inc. or WashingtonPost.com.(1) 
•In our U.S. local property network, the digital audience reached 61.4 million(1) monthly unique visitors, on average, during 2021 while the combined average daily print readership was approximately 4.2 million on Sundays and 5.4 million daily Monday through Saturday. At USA TODAY, the digital audience reached approximately 95.3 million(1) monthly unique visitors, on average, in 2021 and print readership averaged 2.5 million daily Monday through Friday. While our print audience skews to an older demographic, our digital audience skews younger as evidenced by an average 59%(1) of the total U.S. digital millennial audience (ages 25 - 44) that accessed our USA TODAY NETWORK content monthly during 2021.
•In the U.K., our wholly-owned subsidiary, Newsquest, had a digital audience in 2021 of 39.6 million(2) monthly unique users, on average, with a total average print readership of over 3.6 million every week. 
The Publishing segment generates revenue primarily through advertising and subscriptions to our print and digital publications and, to a lesser extent, commercial printing and distribution. The USA TODAY NETWORK has developed an efficient operating model utilizing a single content management platform and integrated shared support for back-office operations such as content design and layout services, print and digital creative development, certain sales and service platforms, and accounting and finance. We also centrally manage production and distribution across our entire newsroom network to maximize efficiency. 
Advertising and marketing: In 2021, Advertising and marketing services revenues at the Publishing segment were $1.337 billion, which represented 46% of total Publishing segment revenues, consistent with 46% in 2020. 
We track our Print advertising revenues in two primary categories: local and national, and classified. Below are descriptions of the categories:
•Local and national advertising includes ads run in our print products, such as our daily or non-daily publications, and are either run-of-press or preprinted inserts (typically stand-alone, multiple page fliers inserted into daily and Sunday 
print products). Local advertising is associated with local merchants or locally owned businesses and national advertising is principally associated with advertisers who are promoting national products or brands. It also includes national brands that are advertised in our local markets. Examples include retailers, commercial banks, airlines, and telecommunications; and
•Classified advertising includes major categories such as legal, obituaries, automotive, employment, and real estate or rentals. Classified advertising is published in the classified or other sections within the publication.
We track Digital advertising and marketing services revenues in three main categories: digital media, digital classified, and digital marketing services. Below are descriptions of these three categories:
•Digital media represents all display advertising either delivered on our products or off-platform on partner channels such as Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News;
•Digital classified encompasses digital advertising revenues associated with our classified partnerships, including auto, employment (i.e., ZipRecruiter, Recruitology), and real estate (i.e., Homes.com) as well as legal, and obituaries; and 
•Digital marketing services represents our integrated, proprietary marketing platform helping local businesses build their online presence, drive awareness and leads, manage and nurture leads, and measure which activities are most effective.
Our advertising teams employ a multi-platform approach to advertising sales under the LOCALiQ brand, which can be specifically tailored to the individual needs of advertisers from small, locally-owned merchants to large, complex businesses. We believe local and national advertisers find it challenging to manage the complexity of their media budgets, particularly on the digital side, and are seeking to reach a shifting audience while also desiring to influence attitudes and behavior at each stage of the purchase path. Our diverse sales force, unique industry scale, and broad portfolio of print and digital advertising and marketing products position us well to solve these challenges. Through our media planning process, we present advertisers with targeted, integrated solutions that help them reach this shifting audience.
The Publishing segment's Advertising and marketing services revenues are subject to moderate seasonality primarily due to fluctuations in advertising volumes tied to holidays and regional weather and activity in our various markets, some of which have a high degree of seasonal residents and tourists. Our Advertising and marketing services revenues are typically highest during the fourth quarter due to holiday and seasonal advertising and lowest in the first quarter following the holiday season. 
Circulation: In 2021, Publishing segment Circulation revenues of $1.250 billion comprised 43% of total Publishing segment revenues, down from 45% in 2020, which makes it our single largest revenue category. In a trend generally consistent within the domestic publishing industry, print circulation volumes declined in 2021. Circulation revenues in the U.S. are derived from our all access content subscription model, single-copy sales, and digital-only subscriptions. Circulation revenues at Newsquest are centered more on single-copy sales, with a larger portion of weekly paid-for titles and free titles as compared to our U.S. publications.
Our all access content subscription model in our local markets includes access to our content via multiple platforms including websites, smartphone and tablet applications, and e-Editions, with subscription prices varying significantly by market, frequency, and product, among other variables. As of December 31, 2021, we had 2.0 million subscribers. We offer our customers EZ Pay, a payment system which automatically deducts subscription payments from customers' credit cards or bank accounts. We have experienced greater subscriber retention with our customers that use EZ Pay. At the end of 2021, EZ Pay was used by 58% of all subscribers across our U.S. local property network (not including USA TODAY).
Growing our digital-only subscribers remains a top strategic priority and, in 2021, our digital-only subscribers increased by 49% on a total Company basis to approximately 1.6 million. While over 95% of digital-only subscriptions were generated from local markets, domestically and internationally, at the end of 2021, USA TODAY, for the first time, launched a digital-only subscription model, placing certain premium content behind a paywall. Our primary digital subscriber acquisition strategies include converting our significant organic traffic through on-platform promotion, paywalls, and dynamic meters for our premium content, conversion through our freemium funnel, paid social, and email marketing. Conversion of organic traffic is also achieved through content marketing, enhancing personalization, content targeting capabilities, and enhanced product experience. A variety of pricing strategies are also used, including discounted introductory periods and sales, to encourage trial and habituation before transitioning to the full price rate. In addition to digital-only subscriptions to our media brands, we offer standalone subscriptions to our Sports+ and Crossword apps. 
In the U.S. local markets, Circulation revenue is largely subscription based, with approximately 87% of Circulation revenues derived from our all access content subscription model and digital-only subscriptions in 2021. 
In addition to the subscription model in our U.S. local markets, single-copy print editions continue to be sold at retail outlets and accounted for approximately 10% of daily and 15% of Sunday net paid circulation volume in 2021. Approximately 47% of the net paid circulation volumes of USA TODAY in 2021 was generated by single-copy sales at retail outlets, vending machines, or hotels that provide copies to their guests. The remainder was generated by home and office delivery, mail, educational, and other sales.
Events: USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures, our events and promotions business, was started in late 2015 to better connect communities and diversify the Company's traditional media offerings. In 2021, USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures produced over 250 events for the Company with a collective attendance over 6.6 million. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of events in 2021 continued to be held virtually, although more live events occurred in 2021 than in 2020. 
USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures creates impactful consumer engagement and experiences through world-class events, promotions, races, and technologies. Our portfolio includes the largest high school sports recognition program in the country, USA TODAY High School Sports Awards, and other brands including the Official Community's Choice Awards, American Influencer Awards, Rugged Maniac, Hot Chocolate 15K/5K, Blockbuster Bucket List sweepstakes, Amazing Teachers contest, and more. Our events are managed with our proprietary ticketing and registration platform, EnMotive, one of the largest race timing companies in the U.S. 
USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures revenues are generated primarily through sponsorship sales, race registrations, ticket sales, and print and digital advertising.
Production and Distribution: Gannett Publishing Services ("GPS") owns and/or operates 35 print facilities. Our print facilities produced 21 publications on average during 2021. By clustering our production resources, utilizing excess capacity for commercial work, or outsourcing where cost-beneficial, we are able to reduce the operating costs of our publications while increasing the quality of our small and mid-size market publications that would typically not otherwise have access to high quality production facilities. We also believe we are able to reduce future capital expenditure needs by having fewer overall pressrooms and buildings. We believe our superior production quality is critical to maintaining and enhancing our position as the leading provider of local news coverage in the markets we serve. 
GPS leverages our existing assets, including employee talent and experience, physical plants and equipment, and our vast national and local distribution networks to produce print products for both Gannett and third party customers. GPS is particularly focused on maximizing our geographic footprint to most efficiently produce and transport our printed product. GPS is responsible for internal and external printing, packaging, and distribution. The distribution of our daily newspapers is typically outsourced to independent, locally based, third-party distributors that also distribute a majority of our weekly newspapers and non-newspaper publications. We continuously evaluate lower cost options for newspaper delivery. In addition, certain of our shopper and weekly publications are delivered via the U.S. Postal Service.
Newsquest operates its publishing activities in a similar manner to GPS, through regional centers to maximize the use of management, finance, printing, and personnel resources. This regional approach allows the business to leverage a variety of back-office and administrative activities to optimize financial results and enables the group to offer readers and advertisers a range of attractive products across the market.
Competition: Our U.S. and U.K. publishing operations and affiliated digital platforms compete with other media and digital companies for advertising and marketing spend. Our Publishing operations also compete for circulation and readership against other news and information outlets and amateur content creators. Each of our publications compete for advertising revenues to varying degrees with traditional media outlets such as direct mail, yellow pages, radio, outdoor advertising, broadcast and cable television, magazines, local, regional and national newspapers, shoppers, and other print and online media sources, including local blogs. We also increasingly compete with digital and social media companies, as well as advertising networks and other programmatic buying channels for advertising revenues. 
Development of opportunities in, and competition from, digital and social media, including websites, tablet, mobile, and social products continues to increase. There is very little barrier to entry and limited capital requirements for new companies to enter the market with competitive digital products. Additionally, we are generally not compensated for the use of our original content by third-party digital products and social platforms. 
The Company expects to continue to expand its audience reach in the digital media industry through internal audience development efforts, content distribution programs, acquisitions, and partnerships to protect its audience market share. Additionally, the Company expects to continue to improve its suite of advertising and marketing services products through both internal development and partnerships to protect its advertising market share.
Government Regulation: We are subject to a variety of laws, rules and regulations in numerous jurisdictions within the United States and in each of the countries where we conduct business. These laws, rules and regulations cover several diverse areas including environmental matters, employee health and safety, data and privacy protection and anti-trust provisions. We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Compliance with governmental regulations did not have during fiscal 2021, and is not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
Environmental Regulation: The Company is committed to protecting the environment. Our goal is to ensure our production and distribution facilities comply with federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and to incorporate appropriate environmental practices and standards in our operations. We believe we are one of the industry leaders in the use of recycled newsprint. During 2021, 12% of our domestic newsprint purchases contained recycled content, with average recycled content of 22%.
Our operations use inks, solvents, and fuels. The use, management, and disposal of certain of these substances are regulated by environmental agencies. We retain a corporate environmental legal consultant who, along with internal and outside counsel, provides advice on regulatory compliance and preventive measures. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations for the protection of the environment and the health and safety of our employees based upon existing facts presently known to us. Compliance with federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, and other related activities has had, and will continue to have, an impact on our operations but has been accomplished to date without having a material adverse effect on our operations. While it is difficult to estimate the timing and ultimate costs to be incurred due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, and technology, based on information currently known to us and insurance procured with respect to certain environmental matters, we do not expect environmental costs or contingencies to be material or to have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Our operations involve risks in these areas, however, and we cannot provide assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect us.
Raw Materials: Newsprint, which is the basic raw material used in our print publications, has been and may continue to be subject to significant price changes from time to time. During 2021, we purchased newsprint as well as other specialty paper grades from 13 domestic and global suppliers. Our total consumption was approximately 180,370 metric tons in 2021, a decrease of 8% from 2020, which included consumption by our owned and operated print sites, third-party printing sites, and Newsquest, and includes consumption for Gannett products as well as products printed commercially for third-parties. In 2021, newsprint availability was constrained due to manufacturing facility closures and on-going capacity shifts between newsprint and specialty paper grades. Further, transportation and other issues challenged and continue to challenge supplier deliveries, including delays that worsened during the fourth quarter of 2021 with increased seasonal demand associated with the holidays. Additionally, inflationary pressures are impacting the overall cost of newsprint and delivery services. The availability and price of newsprint is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which are described more fully under "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Joint Operating Agencies: Our publishing subsidiaries in Detroit, Michigan and York, Pennsylvania each participate in a joint operating agency ("JOA"). In each instance, the JOA performs the production, sales, distribution, and back office functions for our subsidiaries and the publisher of another publication pursuant to a joint operating agreement. Operating results for the Detroit and York JOAs are fully consolidated along with a charge for the minority partners' share of profits. 
Digital Marketing Solutions Segment 
The mission of our Digital Marketing Solutions ("DMS") segment is to help local businesses thrive by delivering customers and driving leads through technology and insights. The DMS segment, branded LOCALiQ, is a sophisticated, cloud-based platform of products differentiated by our proprietary:

•Marketing automation and management tools;
•Patent-pending artificial intelligence bidding engines with goal-based and omnichannel advertising optimization; and
•Customizable reporting with integrated third party platform data.
We believe local businesses want a single, unified solution to solve their digital marketing needs. Our DMS products and solutions help SMBs thrive in four primary ways: 
•Building online presence (i.e., websites, local listings, search engine optimization, social media management, live chat);
•Driving consumer awareness and generating business leads with advertising (i.e., search engine marketing, social advertising, mobile advertising, display advertising, video and over the top advertising, targeted email marketing);
•Building an audience while managing and nurturing leads and customers (i.e., lead alert tools, lead management, lead engagement and automation, job management); and
•Measuring and knowing what works and optimizing future marketing campaigns (i.e., conversion analytics, cross-channel optimization, lead attribution, phone tracking, campaign reporting).
Utilizing our products, we build long-term, recurring revenue relationships while fulfilling our mission of helping local SMBs thrive. As of December 31, 2021, the majority of our DMS customers have a recurring evergreen subscription. With customer budget retention rates of 96% in 2021, we believe the DMS segment provides a stable and predictable business model. 
We run an efficient operating model by leveraging our entire sales organization, which includes local sales in our publishing markets, direct and national sales, and inside sales channels, who utilize a single customer relationship management tool and service all clients and campaigns through our proprietary LOCALiQ platform. The LOCALiQ platform has centralized post-sales functions and utilizes integrated shared support for back-office operations such as accounting and finance. 
We believe the creation of a complementary go-to-market model of "freemium," do-it-yourself ("DIY"), and buy online channels will continue to expand the DMS customer base and revenue. Our new freemium digital marketing solutions offering, launched on the platform in late 2021, is intended to serve as a low friction tool for acquiring new registered users while providing small businesses immediate marketing value and exposing them to the proprietary functionality of our broader LOCALiQ platform before converting to a paid product. We expect to expand the freemium capabilities throughout 2022, in conjunction with DIY and buy online products that we anticipate adding to the platform portfolio. 
Products: Digital marketing requires a holistic view of how online presence, advertising and conversion efforts work together to get results. Our solutions work across the USA TODAY NETWORK and major online platforms such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Snap and others. Our product portfolio offers a simple all-in-one platform powered by artificial intelligence and service experts that grows and adapts with the needs of local business owners. For example, some businesses might need to significantly improve their websites and focus on converting sales leads, while others may need to focus on building awareness of their business and driving more leads to their site and social pages. LOCALiQ DMS identifies the biggest opportunities and provides solutions by recommending the right mix of product platform features and measuring results. 
We have a proprietary set of technologies that enable a business to receive a score on their overall marketing efforts, show them how they stack up against their competitors, and recommend a comprehensive set of solutions to help them achieve their goals. This customized solution is sold as a subscription to our LOCALiQ DMS platform. This platform removes the concerns of unexpected overages and misaligned goals and allows us to set performance-based pricing. The platform optimizes to produce the best results for the business and service experts are assigned to assist with each account, as needed.  
•Our online presence solutions offer high conversion websites, with e-commerce, custom content creation to empower businesses to look professional, and human or bot-enabled live chat which ties into our lead conversion tools. These products are designed to work in concert with our digital advertising products with a goal of enhancing clients’ marketing return on investment.
•Our online advertising products include award-winning technology for bidding and budget management that cover more than 90% of the U.S. online audience. They also include patent-pending machine learning algorithms which optimize multiple advertising channels and campaigns toward a goal with a single budget. Search engine marketing, which is recorded as Advertising and marketing services revenues accounted for 64% of our DMS segment's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.
•Our lead conversion software is a marketing automation platform that includes tools for capturing web traffic information and converting leads into new customers for clients. We provide tools designed to significantly improve the conversion of leads to customers and to help stay top-of-mind during the prospect's decision-making process by using integrated marketing automation to send new prospects targeted e-mails and alerts reminding them to follow up on each lead. Our lead conversion software also provides reports to show how many leads clients are getting from each marketing source and other important business insights. 
•Our additional cloud-based software solutions, offered as a channel partner, include a customer relationship management solution tailored for SMBs, a market-leading collaboration and productivity tool, and voice-over-IP software. Our software solutions are available in North America and our lead conversion software is available in all of our markets.
Distribution: We deliver our suite of products and solutions to local businesses through a combination of our proprietary technology platform, our sales force, and select third-party agencies and resellers. Our DMS segment has sales operations in the 
United States, Canada, New Zealand, and the U.K. During 2021, approximately 94% of our DMS segment revenues were generated in North America and the remaining 6% from other international markets. All DMS segment revenues are digital revenues. 
Competition: The market for local online advertising solutions is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. The market is highly fragmented as there are a number of smaller companies which provide internet marketing services at highly competitive prices and, increasingly, we compete with SMB marketing providers who offer solutions tailored for specific verticals. In addition, the online publishers that we utilize for clients, such as Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, generally offer their products and services through self-service platforms. Many traditional offline media companies also offer online advertising solutions and have large, direct sales forces and digital publishing properties.
Strategy
Gannett is committed to a subscription-led business strategy that drives audience growth and engagement by delivering deeper content experiences to our consumers, while offering the products and marketing expertise our advertisers desire. The execution of this strategy is expected to allow the Company to continue its evolution from a more traditional print media business to a digitally focused content creator and marketing solutions platform.
We intend to create stockholder value through a variety of methods including organic growth driven by our consumer and business-to-business strategies as well as through paying down the debt assumed to consummate the acquisition of Legacy Gannett. The five key operating pillars of our strategy include:
Accelerating digital subscriber growth
The broad reach of our newsroom network, linking leading national journalism at USA TODAY, our local property network in 45 states in the U.S. and Newsquest in the U.K. with more than 120 local media brands, gives us the ability to deepen our relationships with consumers at both the national and local levels. We bring consumers local news and information that impacts their day-to-day lives while keeping them informed of the national events that impact their country. We believe this local content is not readily obtainable elsewhere, and we are able to deliver that content to our customers across multiple print and digital platforms. As such, a key element of our consumer strategy is growing our paid digital-only subscriber base. As part of our digital subscriber growth strategy, we expect to continue to develop and launch new digital subscription offerings tailored to specific topics and audiences. 
Driving digital marketing services growth by engaging more clients in a subscriber relationship
We are now of significant digital scale, with unique reach at both the national and local community levels. We expect to leverage our integrated sales structure and lead generation strategy to continue to aggressively expand our digital marketing services business into our local markets, both domestically and internationally. Given our extensive client base and volume of digital campaigns, we plan to use data and insights to inform new and dynamic advertising products, such as our "freemium" offering to complement our sales structures, that we believe will deliver superior results. 
Optimizing our traditional businesses across print and advertising
We plan to continue to drive the profitability of our traditional print operations through the continued evolution of the core print product, economies of scale, process improvements, and operational focus. We are committed to improving customer service and delivering high quality products for our print subscribers. Print advertising continues to offer a compelling branding opportunity across our network due to our scale and unique reach at both the national and local community levels. 
Prioritizing investments into growth businesses that have significant potential and support our vision
By leveraging our unique footprint, trusted brands, and media reach, we identify, experiment, and invest in potential growth businesses. USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures is a strong example of one such experiment that has grown significantly since its founding in 2015. During 2021, we hosted over 250 events and maintained 92% of USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures' revenues as compared to 2020.
Building on our inclusive and diverse culture to center around meaningful purpose, individual growth and customer focus
Inclusion, Diversity and Equity are core pillars of our organization and influence all that we do, from recruiting, development and retention, to day-to-day operations including hiring, onboarding, education, leadership training and professional development. We have published our inclusion goals for 2025 and our ongoing efforts to progress toward them, including an annual workforce diversity report, which was released for the first time in the first quarter of 2021. We believe aligning our culture around empowering our communities to thrive and putting our customers at the center of everything we do will provide the foundation for our broader strategic efforts. 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
We believe our employees are our greatest asset and the foundation of our business is the people and employees who make our day-to-day operations possible. Inclusion, Diversity and Equity are core pillars of our organization and we regularly track our progress on workforce demographics. In 2021, we published our first installment of an annual report focused on our inclusion, diversity, and equity efforts. The 2021 annual report outlined current workforce diversity data, Gannett's inclusion goals that reach into 2025, as well as the steps we are taking to achieve our goals. The 2021 report highlighted how we are working to meet our goals, including through our employee resource groups ("ERGs"), inclusion training library, emerging leaders program, and diversity advisory council, and improving our recruiting and hiring process to attract more diverse talent, among other things. Gannett expects to continue publishing company-wide workforce demographics twice a year, and 2021 was the first year we gathered intersectional demographic data including military status, LGBTQ+ status, and identification with multiple ethnicities, to enhance our visibility of inclusion among our employees. 
During 2021, the Company also expanded its employee outreach and communications through the launch of an inclusion newsletter, which provides inclusion, diversity and equity news and information, insights on Gannett's latest efforts around inclusion, and details on how employees can participate. The inclusion training library, also developed in 2021, is available to all employees, with courses focused on building an inclusion, diversity, and equity mindset throughout the employee experience. Course materials cover topics such as creating a culture of inclusion, inclusive recruitment, hiring and onboarding, and strengthening a culture of inclusion through employee development. 
In 2021, Gannett was recognized by Forbes Best Employers for Diversity for the second year in a row. Gannett was also recognized in the 2021 Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality. In 2022, for the fifth year in a row, Gannett received a perfect score of 100 on the Corporate Equality Index, the nation’s premier benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality and inclusion. 
Enabling a positive employee experience, within a values-based, inclusive work culture, is a top priority at Gannett. Aligned to our purpose, we endeavor to provide engaging work and foster a culture that supports our employees’ ability to reach their goals and grow through learning and development. We aim to cultivate a safe, diverse, inclusive, and equitable culture with broad promotion of ERGs, with eleven active ERGs operating in the Company. We now operate within a "4c" model to establish goals, determine topics for programming and live discussions, as well as track progress and successes. This 4c model includes the four strategic pillars of Career, Culture, Company, and Community and directly aligns to our Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity strategy. Our two-way communication strategies include intersectional ERG events, monthly Town Hall meetings with our Chief Executive Officer and senior leadership, and our Together employee newsletter, which shares strategies on topics such as remote working, staying connected, and vaccination information and resources.
We listen through bi-annual Your Voice Engagement surveys, multiple Pulse surveys targeting current concerns, and Glint surveys to understand the Gannett employee experience. The performance review process includes goal setting as well as regular manager feedback and coaching to assist with the career growth of our employees, and the use of development plans for individual career growth. We understand the critical need for succession planning and have developed talent and succession plans with customized development plans for critical roles within the organization. On an annual basis, the Board of Directors reviews the succession plans for key senior leadership. Our learning programs have been designed to successfully orient employees, build leadership capabilities and meet individual development needs. Through our centralized Learning Experience Platform, we deliver and manage both internally developed and customized programs such as our leadership development program, as well as partner programs. To further our employees' experience, we offer a volunteer time benefit and community giving campaigns and added Juneteenth as an additional holiday in 2021.
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 13,800 employees in the U.S., of which approximately 17% are represented by labor unions, most of which are affiliated with one of seven international unions. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 2,500 employees outside of the U.S., including approximately 1,800 employed by Newsquest in the 
U.K. Our U.K. subsidiaries bargain with two unions over working practices, wages, and health and safety issues only. Most of our unionized employees work under collective bargaining agreements that have expired, are in the negotiation process, or are negotiating towards an initial collective bargaining agreement. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 79 existing collective bargaining agreements and 15 bargaining units negotiating initial contracts. We believe relations with our employees are generally good, and we had no work stoppages during 2021 at any of our publications.
Climate Change
Gannett's mission of empowering communities to thrive cannot be achieved without considering the pillars that make up our corporate social responsibility platform. As part of our commitment to social responsibility, Gannett strives to minimize its environmental impact through sustainable business practices for sourcing, consumption, and waste. We have taken a number of steps within the organization in an effort to reduce our use of water, to recover and recycle electricity and fossil fuels when possible, and to pursue green energy options where available. We continue to reduce the number of presses in operation by consolidating print operations and by significantly reducing the square footage of our office space through consolidation of offices, in many cases, to more energy efficient spaces. Gannett expects to complete a carbon emissions report during 2022 that will help establish targets around Gannett's carbon usage. 
Gannett will continue its efforts to represent the concerns of the local and national communities where we live and work, reporting on local issues including climate impacts, water quality and sanitation. Gannett launched a National Climate Change reporting team covering the full USA TODAY NETWORK and published more than 270 stories, newsletters or major projects about climate change and the environment in 2021. The USA TODAY NETWORK publishes a weekly newsletter, Climate Point, that curates content about the environment, sustainability, and climate change from across the network for a national audience, helping readers make better informed decisions for themselves, their families, and their communities.
