---+------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Yer Brands Inc. 

1. Hero Wellness Systems Inc. (fka Vitalizer Americas Inc.)
 
Hero Wellness Systems Inc. (“Hero Wellness”) –Pursuant to the terms and conditions of a shareholder’s agreement dated in September 29, 2018, the Company entered into a joint venture relationship originally for the purpose of importing, selling and distributing products offered by Vitalizer International of Switzerland. However, due to supplies and other processing issues, Hero Wellness has sourced its own supplier and is now importing, selling and distributing its own products. SPGX’s participation in the joint venture is 55%. SPGX’s role is to provide certain services, including general management and day to day operations of the joint venture. Currently, the joint venture is comprised of the following ownership: 55% the Company with the balance of ownership held by two non-controlling owners.
 
The Company is focused on the retail and B2B market segment of the lifestyle and healthcare markets. B2B clients consist of spas and salons, hotels and hospitality and entertainment venues in the United States. Additionally, the company is active in the distribution of its Hero Chroma massage chair through its webstore www.herochroma.com and additional websites operated by the company. The company is also in discussions with several brick and mortar retail furniture, specialty sports and massage equipment establishments.
 
Hero Wellness Systems Inc. is dependent upon a functioning supply chain, as it sources finished products from its suppliers in China. Hero Wellness sees this as a risk-factor and is looking for alternative suppliers at this time. Thus far, the supplier has never experienced inventory shortfalls. Additionally, due to its wide marketing strategy, targeting retail customers through internet sales, as well as key account management to gain corporate customers, Hero Wellness is not dependent on singular customers. However, the company’s products are considered luxury lifestyle products and thus are dependent on healthy consumer spending behavior. Slowdowns in consumer confidence could have a negative impact on purchasing behavior of these types of products all across the economy.
 
Hero Wellness Systems operates in a crowded market place. Several providers of massage chair products from low-end to high-end exist. Hero Wellness Systems Inc. operates in the high end-spectrum, competing against a number of established companies. The company aims to differentiate itself from existing providers through a higher level of service, including white glove delivery and significantly faster delivery.
 
While previously predominantly focused on the B2B segment the unprecedented changes in hygiene requirements in shared spaces has had significant impact on purchasing behavior of B2B customers as it relates to leisure equipment. The company currently focuses virtually exclusively in the B2C segment through direct distribution. This led to continued significantly lower than expected sales volumes and will require additional funding for penetrating the market. Additionally, the past 12 months have shown a significant influx of lower cost alternatives distributed by big-box retailers. Price erosion in this segment continues to be an issue for this venture.
 
See Exhibit 10.14 - Shareholder’s Agreement for more details.
 
2. Yer Brands Inc.
 
On May 8th, 2020 Sustainable Projects Group Inc. signed a letter of intent with inventors of the Soy-yer Dough product line, Sawyer and Samantha Sparks, to purchase all production rights, know-how, trademarks and manufacturing equipment of Soy-yer Dough. Soy-yer Dough is a soy and corn-based, gluten free modeling clay. It is estimated that up 6% of the US population suffers from some form of gluten intolerance, with approximately 1% of the US population suffering from the more severe form, Celiac Disease.
 
The product gained initial commercial success when it was featured on the TV Show ABC’s Shark Tank and was named as one of the most innovative product inventions by college students in the New York Times newspaper. Since its invention, the product has been sold in all 50 states in the United States, and to a smaller extent internationally, both online and in retail locations. However, with limited production capabilities and resources, growth prospects were limited.

Sustainable Projects Group has formed YER Brands Inc. as a wholly-owned subsidiary to establish increased production and distribution capabilities of the Soy-yer Dough product line. Inventor and face of the brand, Sawyer Sparks, has agreed to take on the CEO position, while his wife and co-inventor Samantha Sparks will be responsible for production. Production facilities will be co-located with one of the Company’s portfolio companies, Cormo USA Inc. manufacturing facility to benefit from raw material sourcing, logistics and marketing infrastructure synergies. As of May 8th, the new company had begun site improvement at the Rushville production site and it produced and shipped first retail-ready products by mid-May 2020.
 
Previously Soy-yer Dough was sold through the Online B2C, Brick and Mortar, and Scholastic Market. Over the past years, predominantly driven by limited production capacities, a heavy focus was placed on the scholastic market. With COVID-19 related shutdowns, that market has been severely impacted and is currently virtually non-existent even as schools have reopened across the United States.
 
There is a multitude of modeling clays available on the market, Soy-yer Dough shines as a “Made in the USA” and a “Gluten-Free” product with a long track record of positive reviews in the US media. Management believes the product is well positioned for market expansion in the near term. Additionally, YER Brands Inc is in the planning stages for additional, value-added products that involve Soy-yer Dough modeling clay to further the product portfolio and potential revenue and profit generation.
 
The majority of raw ingredients required for the formulation of the product are widely available and produced in the United States. The company does not anticipate supply chain issues for the main ingredients of the Soy-Yer Dough line of products. Additional raw materials are widely available, and several sources of suppliers exist. The company is not dependent on one single source of supplies for any of its ingredients and packaging materials and management sees limited supply chain and sourcing risks.
 
As part of production upscaling the company determined that a successful rollout in the brick and mortar market will require a significant upscaling in production capacity. Given the significant investment needs to develop these capacities the company made the decision to focus on out-sourcing production. At the current time the company is actively seeking production partners for the upscaling process of Yer Brands Inc. Currently the product is not expected to be a significant revenue driver until problems in upscaling and stability can be solved.
 
Dependence on Major Customers
 
As of the date of this filing, neither the Company nor any of its holdings are dependent on any major customers.
 
Patents/Trade Marks/Licenses/Franchises/Concessions/Royalty Agreements or Labour Contracts
 
SPGX has an interest in the following intellectual property:
 
Yer Brands Inc, - There are no registered patents on any of the products produced by Yer Brands Inc, but SPGX holds the intellectual property for the technology. Yer Brands Inc. is the owner of the US Trademark for “Yer Dough” (Serial Number: 90015770).
Government Controls and Regulations
 
The Company’s various business segments are subject to various levels of government controls and regulations, which are supplemented and amended from time to time. Currently, the Company is in compliance with all business and operations licenses that are typically applicable to most commercial ventures. However, management is unable to predict what additional legislation or revisions may be proposed that might affect its business or when any such proposals, if enacted, might become effective. There can be no assurance that existing or new laws or regulations that may be adopted in various jurisdictions in the future, will not impose additional fees and taxes on SPGX and its business operations. Management is not aware of any such revisions to existing laws and regulations nor new laws or regulations that could have a negative impact on the Company’s business and/or any additional costs to the Company’s business operations. Such changes, however, could require increased capital and operating expenditures and could prevent or delay certain operations by the Company.
 
Currently there is no effect of these existing regulations on the Company’s business segments and the Company is able to carry out its business operations as planned. However, it is possible that in the future, governments could change the regulations which could affect the business operations and limit the Company’s ability to continue its operations.
