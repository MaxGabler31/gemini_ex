Rail Products and Services
The Company’s Rail Products and Services (“Rail”) segment is comprised of several manufacturing and distribution businesses that provide a variety of products and services for freight and passenger railroads and industrial companies throughout the world. The Rail segment has sales offices throughout the Americas and Europe, and frequently bids on rail projects where it offers products manufactured by the Company, or sourced from numerous supply chain partners, and aftermarket services. The Rail segment is comprised of the following business units: Rail Products, Rail Technologies, and CXT Concrete Ties.
Rail Products
The Rail Products business is comprised of the Company’s Rail Distribution, Allegheny Rail, and Transit divisions.
Rail Distribution sells new rail mainly to passenger and shortline freight railroads, industrial companies, and rail contractors for the replacement of existing lines or expansion of new lines. Rail accessories sold by the Rail Distribution division include track spikes, bolts, angle bars, and other products required to install or maintain rail lines. These products are manufactured by the Company or purchased from other manufacturers and distributed accordingly. Rail Distribution also sells trackwork products to Class II and III railroads, industrial, and export markets.
The Company’s Allegheny Rail Products (“ARP”) division engineers and fabricates insulated rail joints and related accessories for freight and passenger railroads and industrial customers. Insulated joints are manufactured at the Company’s facilities in Pueblo, CO and Niles, OH.
The Company’s Transit Products division supplies power rail, direct fixation fasteners, coverboards, and special accessories primarily for passenger railroad systems. These products are fabricated at Company facilities or by subcontractors and are usually sold by sealed bid to passenger railroads or to rail contractors.
Rail Technologies
The Company’s Rail Technologies business unit engineers, manufactures, and fabricates friction management products and application systems, railroad condition monitoring systems and equipment, wheel impact load detection, rail anchors and spikes, wayside data collection and management systems, epoxy and nylon-encapsulated insulated rail joints, and track fasteners, and provides aftermarket services. The Company’s friction management products control the friction at the rail/wheel interface, helping our customers reduce fuel consumption, improve operating efficiencies, extend the life of operating assets such as rail and wheels, reduce track stresses, and lower related maintenance and operating costs.

CXT Concrete Ties
L.B. Foster’s subsidiary, CXT Incorporated, manufactures engineered concrete railroad ties for freight and passenger railroads and industrial companies at its facility in Spokane, WA.
Construction Products
The Construction products segment is composed of the following business units: Piling Products, Fabricated Bridge Products, and Precast Concrete Products.
Piling Products
Sheet piling products are interlocking structural steel sections that are generally used to provide lateral support at construction sites. Bearing piling products are steel H-beam sections which are driven into the ground for support of structures such as bridge piers and high-rise buildings. Piling is often used in water and land applications including cellular cofferdams and OPEN CELL® structures in inland river systems and ports.
Piling products are sourced from various manufacturers and either sold or rented to project owners and contractors. The piling division, via a sales force deployed throughout the United States, markets and sells piling domestically and internationally. This division offers its customers various types and dimensions of structural beam piling, sheet piling, and pipe piling. The Company is the primary distributor of domestic steel sheet piling for its primary supplier.
Fabricated Bridge Products
The fabricated products facility in Bedford, PA manufactures a number of fabricated steel and aluminum products primarily for the highway, bridge, and transit industries including concrete reinforced steel grid deck, open steel grid deck, aluminum bridge railing, and stay-in-place steel bridge forms.
Precast Concrete Products
The Precast Concrete Products unit primarily manufactures concrete buildings for national, state, and municipal parks. This unit manufactures restrooms, concession stands, and other protective storage buildings available in multiple designs, textures, and colors. The Company is a leading high-end supplier in terms of volume, product options, and capabilities. The unit also manufactures various other precast products such as burial vaults, bridge beams, box culverts, septic tanks, and other custom pre-stressed and precast concrete products. The products are manufactured in Spokane, WA, Hillsboro, TX, and Waverly, WV.
Tubular and Energy Services
The Tubular and Energy Services segment has four primary business units: Protective Coatings, Threaded Products, Precision Measurement Systems, and Test and Inspection Services. The segment provides products and services predominantly to the mid and upstream oil and gas markets.
Protective Coatings
There are two pipeline service locations that make up the Protective Coatings business unit. The Birmingham, AL facility coats the outside diameter and, to a lesser extent, the inside diameter of pipe primarily for oil & gas transmission pipelines. This location partners with its primary customer, a pipe manufacturer, to market fusion bonded epoxy coatings, abrasion resistant coatings, and internal linings for a wide variety of pipe diameters for pipeline projects throughout North America. The second location is in Willis, TX. The Willis facility applies specialty outside and inside diameter coatings for a wide variety of pipe diameters for oil & gas transmission, mining, and waste water pipelines. This location also provides custom coatings for specialty fittings and connections.
Threaded Products
The Company’s Magnolia, TX facility cuts, threads, and paints pipe primarily for water well applications for the agriculture industry, municipal water authorities, and Oil Country Tubular Goods (“OCTG”) markets.
Precision Measurement Systems
The Company manufactures and provides a turnkey solution for metering and injection systems for the oil and, to a lesser extent, gas industry. The Willis, TX location operates a fabrication plant that builds metering systems for custody transfer applications including crude oil and other petroleum-based products. These systems are used at well sites, pipelines, refineries, chemical plants, and loading/unloading facilities. The Willis location also manufactures and installs additive and dye injection systems. These systems are used to inject performance additives and/or dyes into petroleum products.
Test and Inspection Services
The Company provides inspection and tubular integrity management services for the upstream oil and gas industry. Services include non-destructive testing, inspection, and other asset integrity services such as repair and threading for OCTG and drill tools. Inspection and testing of these products, which include replaceable and re-usable products such as casing,

production tubing, drill pipe, directional motors, drill collars, and related equipment, is a critical preventative measure to ensure personnel and well-site safety, enhance efficiency, and avoid costly equipment failures and well-site shutdowns. The Company offers these services in every major oil and gas producing region throughout the United States.
L B Pipe Joint Venture
The Company is a member of a joint venture, L B Pipe & Coupling Products, LLC (“L B Pipe JV”), in which it maintains a 45% ownership interest. L B Pipe JV manufactures, markets, and sells various machined components and precision couplings products for the energy, water well, and construction markets and is scheduled to terminate on June 30, 2019. The Company has classified its ownership interest as an asset held for sale during the current period. More information concerning L B Pipe JV is set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 8 Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.
Marketing and Competition
L.B. Foster Company generally markets its Rail Products and Services directly in all major industrial areas of the United States, Canada, and Europe. The Construction Products and Tubular and Energy Services are primarily marketed domestically. The Company employs a sales force of approximately 71 people that is supplemented with a network of agents across Europe, South America, and Asia to reach current customers and cultivate potential customers in these areas. For the years ended 2017, 2016, and 2015, approximately 19%, 19%, and 16%, respectively, of the Company’s total sales were outside the United States.
The major markets for the Company’s products are highly competitive. Product availability, quality, service, and price are principal factors of competition within each of these markets. No other company provides the same product mix to the various markets the Company serves. However, there are one or more companies that compete with the Company in each product line. Therefore, the Company faces significant competition from different groups of companies.
During 2017, 2016, and 2015, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.
Raw Materials and Supplies
Most of the Company’s products are purchased in the form of finished or semi-finished products. The Company purchases the majority of its supplies from domestic and foreign steel producers. Generally, the Company has a number of vendor options. However, the Company has an arrangement with a steel mill to distribute steel sheet piling in North America. Should sheet piling from its present supplier not be available for any reason, the Company risks not being able to provide such product to its customers.
The Company’s purchases from foreign suppliers are subject to foreign currency exchange rate changes as well as the usual risks associated with changes in international conditions and to United States and international laws that could impose import restrictions on selected classes of products and for anti-dumping duties if products are sold in the United States at prices that are below specified prices.
Backlog
The dollar amount of firm, unfilled customer orders at December 31, 2017 and 2016 by business segment is as follows:

 | December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016
Rail Products and Services | $ | 68,850 | | | $ | 62,743 
Construction Products | 71,318 | | | 71,954 | 
Tubular and Energy Services | 26,737 | | | 12,759 | 
Total | $ | 166,905 | | | $ | 147,456

Approximately 5% of the December 31, 2017 backlog is related to projects that will extend beyond 2018.
Research and Development
Expenditures for research and development approximated $2,241, $3,511, and $3,937 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. These expenditures were predominately associated with expanding product lines and capabilities within the Company’s Rail Technologies business.
Patents and Trademarks
The Company owns a number of domestic and international patents and trademarks primarily related to its Rail Technologies products. Our business segments are not dependent upon any individual patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks, and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent or trademark, or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product, to be of material importance in relation to our total business.
