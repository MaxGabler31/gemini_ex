Words like “Natural,” “clean label,” “green,” “eco-friendly”, “organic”, “non GMO” and “sustainability” are the new buzzwords in today’s food and beverage industry. Products and ingredients bearing these tags have created demand among consumers, and therefore have been significant purchase influencers. The markets for these natural and naturally derived products are growing at a fast rate, creating an immense profit potential for food and beverage manufacturers. The past two decades have witnessed consumers becoming more health conscious and resorting to preventive measures, rather than reactionary ones. Functional foods and beverages play a major role in this segment, promoting the concept of healthiness-on-the-go. These functional foods and beverages include health ingredients, which may promote general health and well- being by preventing certain diseases. However, the industry also confronts certain challenges in coping with the demand of natural ingredients used in food and beverage applications, particularly, in terms of sustainability.
 
The “health and wellness” mega trend drives the overall natural ingredients market. Increasing incidence of lifestyle-based disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), obesity, osteoporosis and diabetes, has propelled consumers to resort to natural alternatives. Moreover, the number of articles and newsletters circulated in media describing the ill-effects of consuming synthetic ingredients has further cautioned consumers. Consumers perceive natural ingredients as having a positive impact on general health, while synthetic ingredients have certain detrimental effects on health. As a result, food manufacturers have promptly responded to the situation by completely replacing or partially replacing synthetic ingredients with their natural counterparts.
 
It is becoming clearer that healthy eating is transitioning from a niche market to the mainstream. Health and wellness-focused products are expanding rapidly, with eight out of ten of the fastest growing food and beverage categories inextricably linked to consumer perceptions of health. In 2013, the market for Health & Nutrition foods at retail value is estimated at $720 billion with a CAGR of 7.4%. This constituted 24% of the total food market which had an average CAGR of 2.8%. More specifically, the global functional food market is expected to show a CAGR of 9.7% during 2014-2017.
