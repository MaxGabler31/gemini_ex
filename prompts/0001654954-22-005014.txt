ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Form and Year of Organization

American Bio Medica Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated on April 2, 1986 under the laws of the State of New York under the name American Micro Media, Inc. On September 9, 1992, we filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation and changed our name to American Bio Medica Corporation. 

Our Business

We manufacture and sell lateral flow immunoassay tests, primarily for the immediate detection of drugs in urine and oral fluid. Our products are self-contained, cost-effective and user-friendly products that are capable of accurately identifying the presence or absence of drugs in a sample within minutes. The products we manufacture are made 100% in in the United States while our competitors manufacture their products outside the United States, primarily in China. One of our drug testing lines is private labeled for another diagnostic company. 

We also provide strip manufacturing, product assembly and packaging services to an unaffiliated third party related to a diagnostic test that they sell outside the United States and, we manufacture a diagnostic product that is sold under a private label by an unaffiliated third party. We sell (via distribution) a number of other products related to the immediate detection of drugs in urine and oral fluid, as well as offering other point of care diagnostic products via distribution. 

Beginning in March 2020 and throughout the year ended December 31, 2021, we also continued to distribute, on a non-exclusive basis, various Covid-19 rapid tests. 

Our Products

Products for the Detection of Drugs in Urine. We manufacture a number of products that detect the presence or absence of drugs in urine. We offer a number of standard configurations, custom configurations on special order, and different cut-off levels for certain drugs. Cut-off levels are concentrations of drugs or metabolites that must be present in urine (or oral fluid) specimens before a positive result will be obtained. Our urine drugs tests are either 510(k) cleared, CLIA Waived and/or OTC cleared (see “Government Regulations” for information on the regulations related to the sale of our drug tests). We currently manufacture the following urine drug testing product lines: 
Rapid Drug Screen® The Rapid Drug Screen, or RDS®, is a patented rapid drug test that detects the presence or absence of 2 to 10 drugs simultaneously in a single urine specimen. The RDS is available as a card only, or as part of a kit that includes a collection cup.

RDS InCup® The patented RDS InCup is a drug-testing cup that detects the presence or absence of 1 to 12 drugs in a urine specimen. The RDS InCup incorporates collection and testing of a urine sample in a single step. Each RDS InCup contains multiple channels, and each channel contains a drug-testing strip that contains the chemistry to detect a single drug.

Rapid TOX® Rapid TOX is a cost-effective drug test in a cassette platform that simultaneously detects the presence or absence of 1 to 10 drugs in a urine specimen. Each Rapid TOX contains one or two channels, and each channel contains a drug-testing strip that contains the chemistry to detect 1-5 drugs. 

Rapid TOX Cup® II The patented Rapid TOX Cup II is another drug testing cup that detects the presence or absence of 1 to 16 drugs in a urine specimen. The Rapid TOX Cup II also incorporates collection and testing of the urine sample in a single step. Each Rapid TOX Cup II contains multiple channels and each channel contains a single drug-testing strip that contains the chemistry to detect more than one drug. This product is available in two (2) formats; one of which has a smaller cup and testing strips to be more cost competitive. 

Private Label Products We provide a private labeled version of Rapid TOX to an unaffiliated third party for sale globally. In the year ended December 31, 2021 (“Fiscal 2021”), sales of these products were not material. 

Products for the Detection of Drugs in Oral Fluid. We manufacture drug tests that detect the presence or absence of drugs in oral fluids. These products are easy to use and provide test results within minutes with enhanced sensitivity and detection. As of the date of this report, our oral fluid drug tests are marketed “for forensic use only” or for “employment use only” as well as in markets outside the United States; (see “Government Regulations” for information on the regulations related to the sale of our drug tests). We currently offer the following oral fluid drug tests:

OralStat® OralStat is a patented and patent pending, innovative drug test for the detection of drugs in oral fluids. Each OralStat simultaneously tests for 6 or 10 drugs in an oral fluid specimen. 

Private Label Products We do provide a private labeled version of our OralStat product to an unaffiliated third party for sale outside of the United States. There were no sales of this product in Fiscal 2021. 
Other Products. Throughout Fiscal 2021, we distributed a number of other products related to the detection of substances of abuse as well as products to detect certain infectious disease. We do not manufacture these products. With the exception of Covid-19 test sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 (“Fiscal 2020”) outlined below, sales of these products are not a material portion of our total net sales (i.e. they do not total more than 10% of our net sales in the fiscal year). 

In Fiscal 2021, we continued to market various Covid-19 rapid tests via non-exclusive distribution relationships. Currently we are offering a Covid-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test to detect Covid-19 antibodies in whole blood, serum or plasma (via a distribution agreement with Healgen Scientific, LLC), the Co-Diagnostics Logix Smart Covid-19 test, various Covid-19 rapid antigen tests, a Covid-19-Influenza A/B combination test, and in late Fiscal 2021, we started to offer an “at home” Covid-19 rapid antigen test. All of the Covid-19 tests we are offering are being marketed in full compliance with an Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and in compliance with each specific product’s EUA issued by FDA. In Fiscal 2021, we sold $54,000 in Covid-19 testing products; which was 2.4% of our net sales in Fiscal 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2020 (“Fiscal 2020”), we sold $1,572,000 in Covid-19 testing products; which was 37.9% of our net sales in Fiscal 2020. 

Our Markets and Distribution Methods

Rehabilitation/Drug Treatment

The Rehabilitation/Drug Treatment market includes people in both inpatient and outpatient treatment for substance abuse. Drug testing is a positive aspect of treatment as it aids in relapse prevention and encourages honesty both within the patient and with outside interactions. In addition, being able to accurately gauge the current drug use by patients enrolled in a substance abuse program is essential so, urine drug testing is an integral part of treatment programs, including physician office-based programs. There is typically a high frequency of testing in this market. We sell our urine drug tests in this market primarily through our direct sales force and also through a number of distributors.

Pain Management

Drug testing in pain management is one of the major tools of adherence monitoring in the assessment of a patient’s predisposition to, and patterns of, misuse/abuse; a vital first step towards establishing and maintaining the safe and effective use of drugs in the treatment of chronic pain. There are many benefits of using an ABMC drug test; these include reducing the risk for toxicity in patients vulnerable to adverse drug effects, detecting patient non-compliance, reducing the risk of therapeutic failure, and avoiding or detecting drug-drug interaction. Additionally, drug testing enhances the physician’s ability to use drugs effectively and minimize costs. We currently sell our urine drug tests in this market primarily through our direct sales force and also through a number of distributors. 
Other Clinical

Other Clinical markets include emergency rooms/hospitals, family physician offices and laboratories. There are a number of medical emergencies associated with adverse reactions, accidental drug ingestions, and misuse or abuse of prescription drugs and over-the-counter medications. To address this issue, drug testing is performed so healthcare professionals are able to ascertain the drug status of a patient before they administer pharmaceuticals or other treatment. We currently sell our urine drug tests in this market primarily through our direct sales force and also through a number of distributors. We also have a long-term relationship with one of the world’s largest clinical laboratories. 

Government (including law enforcement and criminal justice) 

The Government market includes federal, state, county and local agencies, including police departments, adult and juvenile correctional facilities, pretrial agencies, probation, drug courts and parole departments at the federal and state levels. A significant number of individuals on parole or probation, or within federal, state, county and local correctional facilities and jails, have one or more conditions to their sentence, including but not limited to, periodic drug-testing and substance abuse treatment. We sell our products in this market through our direct sales force.

Employment/Workplace 

The Workplace market consists of pre-employment testing of job applicants, as well as random, cause and post-accident testing of employees. Many employers recognize the financial and safety benefits of implementing drug-free workplace programs, of which drug testing is an integral part. In some states, there are workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance premium reductions, tax deductions and other incentives for adopting these programs. We sell our products in this market through our direct sales force and through a select network of distributors.

International

The International market consists of various markets outside of the United States. Although workplace testing is not as prevalent outside of the United States as within, the international Government and Clinical markets are somewhat in concert with their United States counterparts. One market that is significantly more prevalent outside of the United States is roadside drug testing. We sell in this market through a select network of distributors.
Contract Manufacturing

We provide strip manufacturing and assembly and packaging services to non-affiliated diagnostic companies. In Fiscal 2021, we manufactured a test for the detection of RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus; the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children worldwide), a test for Malaria (a disease transmitted to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes) and we manufactured a special custom panel of our Rapid TOX as a private label. Fiscal 2021 contract manufacturing sales were 9.44% of our net sales in Fiscal 2021.
Competition

We compete on the following factors:

Pricing: The pricing structure in our markets is highly competitive. We offer the only drug testing products that contain testing strips that are 100% manufactured in the US and that is 100% assembled in the United States. Price pressure is the greatest when comparing our pricing with pricing of products manufactured outside of the United States.

Quality: We manufacture, assemble and package our testing strips and products completely in the United States in accordance with quality system regulations set forth by FDA. Many companies in our industry claim their products are manufactured in the United States when in fact; their products are only assembled or packaged in the Unites States. The testing strips and in most cases the assembly of the product is done outside of the Unites States; usually in China. Products manufactured outside of the United States are generally manufactured outside of the requirements of quality system regulations set forth by FDA. In our opinion, this results in inferior, sub-par products being offered in the market. Most of our markets require accurate detection near the cut-off level of the test. Our products are manufactured to detect drug use closer to the cut-off level of the test. The majority of the drug tests on the market today are less “aggressive”; meaning they are not as sensitive and they will miss positive results. Missing positive results can be extremely troublesome to customers from both an economic and liability perspective; and in the clinical market, missing positives can be a threat to the health of the individuals being tested. We do offer products manufactured outside of the United States via distribution relationships to those customers that do not require accuracy near or at the cutoff level in their drug testing programs. 

Customer and technical support: Our customers often need guidance and assistance with certain issues, including but not limited to, test administration, drug cross reactivity and drug metabolism. We provide our customers with continuous customer and technical support on a 24/7/365 basis; staffed by our employees. We believe that this support gives us a competitive advantage since our competitors do not offer this “employee staffed” extended service to their customers. 

Raw Materials and Suppliers

The primary raw materials required for the manufacture of our test strips and our drug tests consist of antibodies, antigens and other reagents, plastic molded pieces, membranes and packaging materials. We maintain an inventory of raw materials. Currently, most raw materials are available from several sources. We own the molds and tooling for our plastic components that are custom and proprietary. The ownership of these molds affords us flexibility and control in managing the supply chain for these components. We do not own the molds and tooling for plastic components that are “stock” items. 
Major Customers

One of our customers accounted for 57.5% of net sales in Fiscal 2021 and 35.2% of net sales in Fiscal, respectively. 

Patents and Trademarks/Licenses

As of December 31, 2021, we have 26 patents issued related to our testing products affording protection in 15 different countries outside the United States and we hold 10 patents in the United States. As of December 31, 2021, we have 1 foreign patent application pending. We are incurring fees related to these patent applications that are being capitalized over the term of the patents.

As of December 31, 2021, we have 15 trademarks registered in the United States and 10 trademarks registered in countries/regions such as Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.

Government Regulations

DOA Products

In certain markets, the development, testing, manufacture and sale of our drug tests, and possible additional testing products for other substances or conditions, are subject to regulation by the United States and foreign regulatory agencies. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and associated regulations, the FDA regulates the pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution and promotion of medical devices. When a product is a medical device, a 510(k) marketing application must be submitted to the FDA. A 510(k) is a premarketing submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is safe and effective. Applicants must compare their 510(k) device to one or more similar devices currently being marketed in the United States. Most of our urine-based products are marketed and sold in the Clinical market (in addition to other markets) and therefore, we have obtained 510(k) marketing clearance, CLIA waiver (see below) and/or Over-The-Counter (OTC) marketing clearance on our urine based products. Our oral fluid products are not 510(k) cleared; so we can only market and sell these products to the forensic market, the employment market (under a limited exemption issued by FDA in July 2017) and for export outside the United States.

In order to sell our products in Canada, we must comply with ISO 13485:2003, the International Standards Organization’s Directive for Quality Systems for Medical Devices (MDD or Medical Device Directive), and in order to sell our products in the European Union, we must obtain CE marking for our products (in the European Union, a “CE” mark is affixed to the product for easy identification of quality products). Collectively, these standards are similar to FDA regulations, and are a reasonable assurance to the customer that our products are manufactured in a consistent manner to help ensure that quality defect-free goods are produced. As of the date of this report, we have received approval and the right to bear the CE mark on our Rapid Drug Screen, Rapid ONE, Rapid TOX, RDS InCup, Rapid TOX Cup II, Rapid Reader and OralStat. We are currently certified to I.S. EN ISO 13485:2016 with an expiration date of July 31, 2022. In Fiscal 2020, we decided not to renew our product licenses in Canada due to significant increased costs of licensing compared to the negligible sales we had in Canada. 

The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988 established quality standards for laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. As a result, those using CLIA waived tests are not subject to the more stringent and expensive requirements of moderate or high complexity laboratories. We have received CLIA waiver from the FDA related to our Rapid TOX product line and OTC clearance on our Rapid TOX Cup II product line (the OTC clearance of the Rapid TOX Cup II product line means they are CLIA waived products). 

Due to the nature of the manufacturing of our drug tests, the products we offer through contract manufacturing and the raw materials used for both, we do not incur any material costs associated with compliance with environmental laws, nor do we experience any material effects of compliance with environmental laws.

 Covid-19 Testing Products

 Covid-19 related testing products are (as of the date of this report), being marketed and sold in the United States under the March 2020 Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) policy set forth by the FDA. An EUA is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including testing devices, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In order for a product to be marketed under the EUA policy, a number of requirements must be met. All of the Covid-19 tests we are offering are being marketed in full compliance with the EUA issued by the FDA and in compliance with each specific product’s EUA issued by FDA. In order to sell Covid-19 tests to locations within Europe, the products must be CE marked. All of the Covid-19 testing products referenced herein bear CE marking. 
Manufacturing and Employees

Our facility in Kinderhook, New York houses assembly and packaging of the products we manufacture (including the products we supply on a contract manufacturing basis and the products we supply to a third party who markets the products under their own private label). Our warehouse, shipping department and administrative offices are also within our New York facility. 

In our Logan Township, New Jersey facility, we manufacture our drug test strips and test strips for unaffiliated third parties. We also perform research and development in our New Jersey facility. 

Unaffiliated third parties manufacture the adulteration, alcohol and certain forensic drug testing products we offer as well as the Covid-19 testing products we distribute. We continue to primarily outsource the printing of the plastic components used in our products, and we outsource the manufacture of the plastic components used in our products. 

As of December 31, 2021, we had 37 employees, of which 32 were full-time and 5 were part-time. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
