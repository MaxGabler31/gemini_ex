Item 1. Business. 
General 
 The AZEK Company Inc. (the Company, which may be referred to as AZEK, we or us) is an industry-leading designer and manufacturer of beautiful, low maintenance and environmentally sustainable outdoor living products, including TimberTech® decking, Versatex® and AZEK® Trim, and StruXure™ pergolas. Our predecessor was formed on August 15, 2013, and, in connection with our initial public offering, or our IPO, we became a Delaware corporation and changed our name to The AZEK Company Inc. on June 11, 2020. Our principal executive offices are located at 1330 W Fulton Street, Suite 350, Chicago, Illinois 60607, and our telephone number is 877-275-2935. AZEK operates highly automated manufacturing and recycling facilities in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Idaho, Georgia, Nevada, New Jersey, Michigan and Minnesota. Our website address is www.azekco.com.

Environmental, Social Responsibility and Corporate Governance 
 Through our FULL-CIRCLE™ ESG strategy, we are committed to pursuing initiatives that positively impact our products, our people and our planet. One of our core values is to “always do the right thing”. We make decisions according to what is right, not what is the cheapest, fastest or easiest, and we strive to always operate with integrity, transparency and with the customer in mind. In furtherance of that value, we are focused on sustainability across our operations and have adopted strategies to enable us to meet the growing demand for environmentally friendly products. 
 Under the direction of our chief executive officer and the board of directors, we are focused on continually improving our high level of environmental and social responsibility and further strengthening our corporate governance. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our strategy on corporate social responsibility and sustainability, including environmental, social and governance, or ESG, matters and related policies and communications. Additionally, we have established an internal ESG Steering Committee comprised of cross-functional leaders from across our organization that is focused on implementing ESG strategies and policies and reports directly to our chief executive officer. 
 Our corporate values serve as a belief system that guides how we work. These values influence our decisions, our interactions with colleagues and customers, and our standards for behavior. Our core value of “always do the right thing” is the foundation of our overarching commitment to ESG stewardship. In accordance with this commitment, we are a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, a global initiative focused on advancing sustainable and responsible business practices related to human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. 
 We operate our business in a manner that is centered on sustainability and promotes environmental stewardship across our value chain from product design to raw material sourcing and manufacturing to employee, customer and stakeholder communications and engagement. For example, we estimate that since 2015 more than two million trees have been saved because our customers chose our decking products over wood. As part of the building materials industry, we believe that we can play a role in advancing the circular economy to create a more sustainable future by increasing the recycling of wood, plastic, aluminum and water, measuring our product lifecycle impacts, measuring and committing to reduce our carbon footprint and encouraging those in our supply chain to do the same. For instance, the wood used in the core of our composite decking products is 100% recycled from sources that include, but are not limited to, facilities that manufacture wood mouldings, flooring, windows, doors and other products. Through our recycling programs, approximately 500 million pounds of scrap and waste were diverted from landfills in fiscal year 2022. In addition, approximately 56% of all of our extruded materials were manufactured from recycled materials in fiscal year 2022 and we believe there is an opportunity to increase this percentage in the future.  To further demonstrate our commitment to sustainability, in 2021, we announced an ambition to use one billion pounds of waste and scrap annually in the manufacturing of our products by the end of 2026. In 2022, we committed to setting science-based emissions reductions targets through the Science-Based Targets initiative, a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature. Other actions include investing in state-of-the-art polyethylene and PVC recycling facilities, continuing and expanding our innovative FULL-CIRCLE Recycling™ program, increasing the amount of recycled content in our products, which lowers the overall carbon footprint of our products, repurposing the scraps from our board-making process back into production, implementing water- and energy-efficient manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facilities and deliberately sourcing and reusing hard-to-recycle materials that would traditionally end

up in landfills. AZEK has been broadly recognized for its leadership in sustainability and ESG, including receiving Cohn Reznick’s 2022 Gamechangers in ESG award as well as achieving +VantageVinyl verification from the Vinyl Sustainability Council for the second year in a row.
 We are also committed to social responsibility within our workforce and our community and have adopted human capital and human rights management policies to further our commitment to social responsibility. Our culture is driven by a shared passion for our values, mission and performance. It is an inclusive culture of innovative, growth-minded individuals committed to always doing the right thing, continuous improvement and solving problems for our customers and partners. 
 We compensate our employees according to our fair remuneration policies and believe deeply in paying for performance. We also provide attractive benefits that promote the health of our employees and their families including medical, dental and vision coverage, company-paid life insurance, short and long-term disability, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts and an employee assistance program. We are also committed to the financial wellness of our employees and have launched several resources and policies in alignment with this, including a 401(k) plan with a company match, an employee stock purchase program with a company match, a parental leave policy and a military leave policy for our active military members. In addition, in conjunction with our initial public offering, we provided all employees an opportunity for ownership in our company by granting them shares of our Class A common stock.
 We have implemented recruitment strategies that enable us to hire and retain diverse and highly talented employees that bring a diverse range of thought and skills to the business. In our employee selection process and the operation of our business we adhere to equal employment opportunity policies. Additionally, we work to build an inclusive culture of continued learning by offering a comprehensive training program which includes diversity-focused and leadership development trainings in order to provide employees opportunities to broaden their perspective and develop their skills in application to the business.
 Our employees frequently hear from executive management, especially the Chief Executive Officer, who leads all-employee town halls where he provides business updates, aligns employees to our mission and values, and answers questions submitted directly from employees. He also regularly meets with small groups of employees to receive their feedback on the business. On an annual basis, we distribute an employee engagement survey that allows us to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement to ensure continued engagement, satisfaction and retention of our employees. 
 We are also proud to develop a culture that celebrates the individuality of our employees while providing a supportive team environment. We host quarterly, diversity-focused engagement events frequently featuring employees themselves, and even members from our Board of Directors. We launched employee resource groups that provide resources and support to our employees and are active in our local communities. We also provide opportunities for employees to get involved in the community as volunteers, whether in support of sustainability or people-focused initiatives. We implemented an employee charitable match program that matched donations made by employees and contributes in recognition of volunteer hours served to eligible charitable organizations. These programs fall under our Bringing Forward the Best of AZEK culture initiative which focuses on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), leadership development and values-alignment. 
 In recognition of creating a culture where employees feel highly engaged, appreciated and fulfilled, AZEK was named one of Chicago Tribune’s Top Workplaces for the second year in a row in 2022. AZEK was also named one of America’s Most Trusted Companies in 2022 by Newsweek and Statista in a survey of 50,000 participants including customers, investors and employees. Finally, AZEK was included in Inc. Magazine’s first-annual Best-Led Companies.
 Our Environmental, Health and Safety, or EHS, Policy outlines our management programs and expectations throughout our operations and businesses. We manage operational hazards and risks to provide workplaces that are safe and healthy for our employees, visitors, contractors, customers, and the communities in which we operate. We train our employees, so they have the awareness, knowledge and skills to work in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. We continually are reviewing and improving our EHS performance through ongoing training, objectives and management systems. 
 As a company, we are committed to being responsible and respected citizens in the communities in which we live and work. We support organizations that help people live more productive, educated and enriched lives and encourage our employees to contribute their time to support various community and charitable activities in alignment with their values.

 Business and Growth Strategies 
 We are an industry-leading designer and manufacturer of beautiful, low-maintenance and environmentally sustainable products focused on the highly attractive, large and fast-growing Outdoor Living market. Homeowners are investing in their outdoor spaces and are increasingly recognizing the significant advantages of engineered, long-lasting products, which are converting demand away from traditional materials, particularly wood. Our products transform those outdoor spaces by combining highly appealing aesthetics with significantly lower maintenance costs compared to traditional materials. Our innovative portfolio of Outdoor Living products, including decking, railing, exterior trim, siding, cladding, pergolas and cabanas and accessories, inspires consumers to design outdoor spaces tailored to their unique lifestyle needs. In addition to our leading suite of Outdoor Living products, we sell a broad range of highly engineered products that are sold in commercial markets, including partitions, lockers and storage solutions. We are a leader in our product categories because of our significant scale, vertically-integrated manufacturing capabilities, extensive material science expertise and execution-focused management team. 
 Over our more than 30-year history, we have developed a reputation as a leading innovator in our markets by leveraging our differentiated manufacturing capabilities, material science and research and development, or R&D, expertise to capitalize on favorable secular growth trends that are accelerating material conversion from traditional materials such as wood, to sustainable, low-maintenance engineered materials, and to expand our markets. We believe our core competency of consistently launching new, high-quality products into the market, combined with our consistent investments in sales, marketing, R&D and manufacturing, will 
 5

continue to solidify our incumbent position as a market leader and enable us to generate long-term demand for our products through various economic cycles. Throughout our history, we have introduced numerous disruptive products and demonstrated our ability to drive material conversion and extend our portfolio, addressing consumer needs across a wide range of price segments. We have achieved a premium brand reputation through our unwavering commitment to our customers and developing innovative new products that combine the latest style and design trends with our differentiated material science expertise and proprietary production technologies. For example, we have launched products that take premium flooring trends, such as wire-brushed and hand-scraped finishes and multiple widths, into the decking market and have seen strong demand for those innovative products, providing consumers greater flexibility to curate and personalize their outdoor lifestyle. In fiscal year 2022, we introduced a new color within our Landmark decking collection, French White Oak, which emulates the aesthetic of reclaimed wood, as well as our CAPTIVATETM prefinished trim and siding products that leverage our proprietary PaintPro® technology.  Our competitive advantages enable us to create award-winning products and back them with some of the industry’s longest warranties, such as the 50-year fade & stain limited warranty that we offer on our TimberTech AZEK decking product line. 
 We have created an operating platform that is centered around sustainability, one of our core strategic pillars, which extends across our value chain from product design to raw material sourcing and manufacturing, and we increasingly utilize plastic waste, recycled wood and scrap in our products. We have also made significant investments in our recycling capabilities over the past few years, including our acquisition of Return Polymers in 2020, which further enhance the sustainability of our manufacturing operations and reduce our costs. In fiscal year 2019, we opened a new polyethylene recycling facility that utilizes advanced technologies to transform a broad range of plastic waste into raw material used in our products. Today, our TimberTech PRO and EDGE decking lines offer high-quality products made from approximately 85% recycled material. Through our recycling programs, approximately 500 million pounds of waste and scrap were diverted from landfills in fiscal year 2022. Furthermore, approximately 99% of scrap generated is re-used, and the majority of our TimberTech, AZEK Exteriors and Versatex products are recyclable at the end of their useful lives. 
 We believe our multi-faceted growth and margin expansion strategy positions us to drive profitable above-market growth in the markets we serve. This strategy includes initiatives to: 
  
• | Accelerate material conversion from wood and other inferior products to AZEK’s low-maintenance, long-lasting products by capitalizing on downstream investments;

Our Brands and Products 
 We currently operate in two reportable segments: Residential and Commercial. We leverage a shared material technology and U.S.-based manufacturing platform to create an extensive range of long-lasting and low-maintenance products that convert demand away from traditional materials. Our Residential segment serves the high-growth Outdoor Living market by offering products that inspire consumers to design outdoor spaces tailored to their individual lifestyles. Our innovative portfolio of Outdoor Living products, including decking, railing, exterior trim, pergolas and cabanas and accessories, are sold under our TimberTech, AZEK Exteriors, VERSATEX, ULTRALOX, StruXure and INTEX brands. Our Commercial segment addresses demand for low-maintenance, highly engineered products in a variety of commercial and industrial markets, including the outdoor, graphic displays and signage, educational and recreational markets, as well as the industrial and chemical industries. Products sold by our Commercial segment include highly engineered polymer sheeting as well as partitions, lockers and storage solutions. 
Residential Segment 
 In our Residential segment, we design and manufacture engineered Outdoor Living products, including decking, railing, trim and moulding, siding and cladding, pergolas and cabanas and accessories that drive conversion away from wood and other traditional materials. These products are primarily manufactured using capped wood composites and PVC technology that are aesthetically similar, yet functionally superior, to finished wood, as they require less maintenance, do not rot or warp, are resistant to water, insects, stains, moisture, mold, mildew, scuffs and scratching, and do not require painting or staining for protection. Many of our products are also designed to ease installation for contractors and builders and reduce lifetime maintenance costs for consumers, without sacrificing aesthetics. We believe these factors, combined with some of the industry’s longest warranties and a comprehensive range of on-trend color palettes and styles, drive contractor loyalty and offer a compelling choice for consumers looking to reinvent their outdoor living spaces and the exteriors of their homes.

In fiscal year 2022, our Residential segment generated net sales of $1,169 million, representing approximately 86% of our total consolidated net sales. Our Residential segment consists of Deck, Rail & Accessories which is approximately 56% of total consolidated net sales, Exteriors which is approximately 25% of total consolidated net sales and Pergolas and Cabanas which is approximately 5% of total consolidated net sales. Demand for our Residential segment products is largely driven by repair and remodel activity, which we estimate accounted for approximately 80% of our Residential segment net sales in fiscal year 2022 with the remaining sales attributable to new construction activity. 
 Decking 
 We are one of the only decking manufacturers to offer both capped wood composite and PVC decking products. Our decking products transform consumers’ outdoor areas into aesthetically appealing spaces, while reducing lifetime maintenance costs as compared to those made with traditional materials. These high-quality, innovative products are artfully crafted with a broad range of design options and distinguishing features, such as cascading or variegated tones to emulate the natural look and finish of wood. Our products are long lasting and often a more cost-effective alternative over time than products made of traditional materials such as wood, which can fade quickly, require frequent sanding, staining and maintenance and are prone to rot, splinter and crack. In addition, our decking products span a wide range of entry-level to premium price points and are covered by some of the industry’s longest warranties. We are also committed to sustainability and to manufacturing our products with recycled waste and scrap. The wood used in the core of our decking products is 100% recycled, and we do not use any virgin timber. We continue to expand our use of recycled materials in our decking products, such as in our TimberTech PRO and EDGE decking product lines, which offer products made from approximately 85% recycled material. 
Through our three primary decking product lines—TimberTech AZEK, TimberTech PRO and TimberTech EDGE—we offer a broad range of colors, textures and styles to provide consumers with a myriad of design options at a variety of price points. Our TimberTech AZEK line is our most advanced, premium capped polymer technology and offers single- and multi-color options, multiple form factors, including variable widths and a 1.5” thick profile version, and increased benefits, such as durability, slip resistance, heat dissipation and fire resistance, as compared to both wood and capped composite products. TimberTech AZEK products are made from up to 60% recycled content. Our TimberTech PRO line is our premium capped composite line that is made from a combination of recycled plastics, recycled wood and other additives, and it is made from up to 85% recycled content, including 100% recycled wood. TimberTech PRO products are capped on all four sides, which offers greater mold and moisture protection as compared to similar products that are capped only on three sides. This line also offers many of the aesthetic options available in our TimberTech AZEK line. Our TimberTech EDGE line is our entry-level capped composite line that is also made from up to 85% recycled content, including 100% recycled wood, and offers consumers a cost-effective alternative to wood. TimberTech EDGE products are capped on three sides and offer a high level of moisture resistance as compared to wood, come in both monochromatic and blended coloring profiles. All of our decking lines are backed by our industry-leading warranties, ranging from 25-year limited and fade and stain warranties on our TimberTech EDGE products to a lifetime limited warranty and a 50-year fade and stain limited warranty on our TimberTech AZEK products.
 Our decking product lines are complemented by our porch collection as well as our broad range of decking accessories, including in-deck and riser lighting, risers for use on stairs, fascia, end coating, flashing and joist tape and our TimberTech Deck Cleaner. Our growing portfolio of porch board products leverages the same materials and production technologies as our industry-leading decking products and allows us to deliver similar design aesthetics and low-maintenance benefits across a variety of textures. We offer a broad range of high-quality fasteners that enable an efficient installation, safe fastening and superior aesthetics, including traditional fasteners, which are color-matched to the decking product and are offered in both coated carbon steel and stainless steel; concealed fasteners, which are covered with a color-matching cap to blend into the associated decking product; and hidden fasteners, which are fastened out of sight under the decking boards. 
 Railing 
 Our railing solutions enable consumers to accent their outdoor living spaces with attractive, high-quality, low-maintenance composite, PVC and aluminum railing products, which we offer through our TimberTech, ULTRALOX and INTEX brands. Our railing products reduce the need for ongoing maintenance by eliminating many of the major functional disadvantages of traditional materials, such as warping and rust, and thus are often a more cost-effective alternative over time. For example, our TimberTech composite railing products are covered by a four-sided cap, which eliminates the need for annual sanding, staining, sealing and painting, and our TimberTech aluminum railing products feature a powder coated surface, which produces a long-lasting, color-durable, moisture-resistant finish. Our premium INTEX brand offers high-quality PVC railing solutions, including custom and kitted products.
 Our railing products are available in various materials and in a broad range of colors, finishes and styles, including traditional, modern and minimalist designs, and we offer a wide selection of infill options, such as composite and aluminum balusters, cable rails and glass panel kits. Our aluminum railing products are lighter weight and easier to install than other metal railing materials, and their sleek, minimalistic designs allow unobstructed views, especially when coupled with a glass or cable infill option. Our railing products 
 7

are diverse and highly customizable, and, in addition to complementing our decking product lines, they also appeal to a broader, stand-alone market, such as for use on decks constructed from traditional materials and in commercial applications. 
 We believe we are particularly well positioned to serve the fast growing aluminum railing market. Using Ultralox’s proprietary Interlocking Machine, a dealer or contractor can create a customized aluminum, pre-panelized, interlocking railing system on site. This facilitates faster and easier assembly and installation without special tools, mechanical fasteners or welding for both residential and commercial applications. Our TimberTech brand also sells a pre-panelized version that utilizes the Ultralox Interlocking Technology branded as Impression Rail Express. 
 To complement our railing products, we offer an array of functional and decorative accessories, including drink rails, structural mounting posts, a complete lighting package and gate kits. Our decking, railing and related accessory products are frequently used in combination in order to enable consumers to create their own highly customized and sustainable outdoor living spaces. 
 Trim and Moulding 
 We are the leading designer and manufacturer of PVC trim and moulding products for the Outdoor Living market. We operate two large PVC trim manufacturing plants and offer a diverse portfolio of PVC trim and moulding products through our AZEK Exteriors and VERSATEX brands. Our trim and moulding products are aesthetically similar to wood and can be easily milled, routed or shaped for use in almost any application. Our products are moisture- and insect-resistant and are more durable and require less maintenance than traditional wood products. Contractors and homeowners can use our products in conventional applications, to express their creativity through unique home exteriors, and to complement our decking and railing products. For example, two-story decks are often paired with column wraps, canvas porch ceilings and other trim and moulding accents. Our trim and moulding products are also increasingly utilized within the home, including as wainscot trim or as shiplap, which originated to protect the exteriors of homes in harsh climates, but is now a popular way to create unique interior spaces. Our products are also used by mill shops and OEM fabricators, who rely on our products due to their consistent formulation, dimensional accuracy and precision and high machinability, to manufacture a wide range of other Outdoor Living products such as pergolas, arbors and flowerbeds. 
 Our full line of AZEK Exteriors and VERSATEX products includes trim and moulding, value-added fabricated products, paintable trim and specialty siding solutions:

Product Research and Development 
 Over the past 30 years, we have built an R&D organization with significant expertise in material science and production process technologies. We leverage our R&D and U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities to deliver innovative new products to market that address evolving customer needs. We have made substantial investments in our R&D organization, which, as of September 30, 2022, consisted of over 30 team members, including approximately 20 engineers. We are committed to continuing to invest in our R&D capabilities to further strengthen our ability to regularly introduce new products that set us apart from our competition and accelerate future growth. 
 Our product managers and marketing team actively analyze proprietary consumer research and work with architects, contractors and consumers to identify and develop new products that incorporate consumer feedback, expand our portfolio and extend the range of style and design options we offer. Our R&D team then designs, prototypes and tests these new products prior to full scale production. Our rigorous R&D process incorporates in-house analytical capabilities and comprehensive product testing with more than 260 distinct tests, such as accelerated weathering. 
 We believe our focus on innovation allows us to bring on-trend products to market rapidly. For example, we were able to leverage our proprietary color pigmentation technology to adapt quickly to lighter color decking trends and introduce our whitewashed cedar products. Similarly, in response to popular flooring trends, our technological and material science expertise enables us to manufacture wide-width and multi-width decking products that we believe will help accelerate conversion from wood decking products. More recently in fiscal year 2021, our innovation engine enabled us to successfully introduce an engineered decking product that mimics the appearance of reclaimed wood, providing homeowners with a rustic aesthetic but without the hassle of maintaining dilapidated wood. In our Commercial segment, the introduction of our Aria partitions responds to demand for increased privacy and the introduction of our TimberLine products addresses the adjacent market demand for beautiful, low-maintenance engineered products with a wood-like look in outdoor furniture, cabinetry and other applications. 
 We currently have a broad portfolio of ongoing development projects across our core product categories as well as certain adjacent products and markets. We leverage our acquisitions to bring us new technologies and product applications. For example, we continue to leverage the Ultralox team to develop additional aluminum and steel railing products and the StruXure acquisition to introduce new pergola and cabana products to TimberTech customers. In addition, we are constantly evaluating opportunities to use our technological and U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities to expand into new markets where we believe there is an opportunity to drive material conversion or otherwise broaden our market reach. 
 Distribution 
 Within our Residential segment, we sell our products through a network of more than 5,000 professional dealers and thousands of home improvement retail outlets, including both stocking and special order locations. These outlets are served by approximately 40 distributors with over 150 branch locations, enabling us to effectively serve contractors and customers throughout the United States and Canada. Within our Commercial segment, we sell our products through a widespread distribution network, as well as directly to OEMs. Our products are generally sold through both one-step and two-step distribution channels. Our distribution network has broad geographic coverage and benefits from the logistics capabilities of our distributors as well as the ability of our distributors and dealers to help generate demand for our products through direct sales, merchandising and marketing. In fiscal year 2022, approximately 99% of our gross sales came from the United States and Canada. Our distributors in locations outside of the United States and Canada are responsible for marketing and selling our products in other countries to which our products are exported. We are continually evaluating our distribution strategy to ensure that we can meet the demands of our consumers in the most effective ways. 
Residential Segment 
 We distribute the majority of our Residential segment products through approximately 40 distributors, who in turn sell our products to dealers. Our distributors also maintain an inventory of our products and support our dealers by managing shipping logistics. We have exclusive relationships with our distributors for decking and trim with respect to specified geographies, and, although some legacy distributors are permitted to carry only certain of our products, many of our distributors are required to carry a comprehensive selection of our TimberTech and AZEK products. Our top ten distributors for the year ended September 30, 2022, accounted for a majority of our total net sales during that period. 
 Through our distributors, our products are sold to more than 5,000 professional dealers and lumber yards and through thousands of home improvement retail outlets, including both stocking and special order locations. Additionally, we have special order and stocking relationships with certain home improvement retailers with thousands of locations across the United States and Canada. We attempt to drive sales to our dealers and retailers through digital tools and extensive marketing directed at consumers who can help create pull-through demand for our products among influencers and decision makers such as architects, builders and contractors. Our dealers typically exhibit high brand loyalty and are incentivized to consolidate the manufacturers from which they purchase to maximize early buy discounts and annual volume rebates. 
 10

Contractors purchase our products through dealers and retailers. We believe contractors are typically loyal to brands and products they trust because their reputations are often connected to the quality of the products they install and they are a direct point of contact for consumers to provide feedback. We consider the needs of and feedback from contractors in designing and manufacturing new products, and we invest in strengthening our relationships with these contractors as we believe they significantly influence decisions regarding material and brand selection for the types of products we produce. 
 We allocate significant sales force resources to support our dealers, and we believe our strong relationships with dealers and contractors are driven by the trust and reliability that we have generated through product innovation, superior quality and performance and the continuing support that we offer. Such support includes specialized training opportunities such as AZEK University and sales support initiatives such as digital lead generation, joint marketing funds, new sample kits, display kiosks, enhanced product literature, print, TV and radio advertising and social media initiatives. AZEK University provides training for contractors and customers installing and using TimberTech and AZEK Exteriors products. We have invested and upgraded our AZEK University programming to include virtual trainings and on-demand digital tools that have enabled us to reach a larger audience in an efficient manner. Additionally, our AZEK Pro Rewards program leverages our new website and digital capabilities to share curated digital leads with our contractors. 
 Parksite Inc., who distributes our Residential segment products, accounted for approximately 19% of our net sales for the year ended September 30, 2022. 
 Commercial Segment 
 Our Vycom products are primarily sold through approximately 125 engineered product distributors across the United States, Canada and Latin America, who in turn sell full sheet and/or fabricated products that have been converted into a wide variety of components or items for various industrial uses primarily to OEMs. We also sell certain Vycom products directly to OEMs. 
 Our Scranton Products bathroom partition and locker systems are sold through a network of approximately 850 dealers who sell to industrial and commercial customers across the United States and in Canada. We market the benefits of our bathroom partition and locker systems directly to architects and facilities managers, who frequently specify products by name and material in their designs. 
 Operations and Manufacturing 
 We are a vertically-integrated, U.S-based manufacturer, delivering superior quality products with a competitive cost position. Our competitive cost position, including our relatively low transportation costs resulting from us being a U.S.-based manufacturer, provides us with a competitive freight advantage relative to imported products. Our versatile, process-oriented manufacturing operations are built on a foundation of extensive material development and processing capabilities. Approximately 85% of our gross sales are attributable to products that are manufactured through an extrusion process that contains a blend of virgin polymers and recycled materials. Our proprietary production technologies, material blending proficiency and range of extrusion capabilities enable innovation and facilitate expansion into new markets. We have deep experience working with multiple technologies that enable us to provide some of the industry’s most attractive visuals through advanced streaking and multi-color technologies. Our manufacturing footprint includes 14 manufacturing and recycling facilities across 13 geographic locations totaling approximately 3.5 million square feet, and we have made significant investments in people, processes and systems to increase our manufacturing scale and productivity. We have expanded our manufacturing operations with the addition of a manufacturing facility in Boise, Idaho, which began production in fiscal year 2022. We expanded our vertical manufacturing capabilities through our acquisition of PVC recycling operation Return Polymers in early 2020, which complements our polyethylene recycling facility. In late 2021, we acquired StruXure Outdoor, LLC, or StruXure, a designer and manufacturer of high-quality and innovative aluminum pergolas and cabanas, which are a natural complement to our TimberTech portfolio and drive wood conversion. In 2022, we also acquired INTEX Millwork Solutions, LLC, or INTEX, a provider of high-quality railing solutions, column wraps, and pergolas that strengthens our existing Railing and Exteriors portfolios with similar material science targeting wood conversion.
 In line with our core values of being “better today than yesterday” and “leading through innovation”, we use our continuous improvement program known as the AZEK Integrated Management System to manage and monitor operations, and we also utilize Lean Six Sigma tools and techniques at all our manufacturing facilities to reduce material waste and improve manufacturing efficiency. We have integrated manufacturing operations and differentiated technical expertise in utilizing recycled materials to develop sustainable, cutting-edge products. Sustainability is one of our core strategic pillars, and we are committed to introducing sustainable products that utilize recycled materials, reduce deforestation and are versatile and recyclable at the end of their useful lives. We are dedicated to expanding our recycling capability and investing in the use of reclaimed materials in our manufacturing processes.

Sales and Marketing 
 Residential Segment 
 Our Residential segment sales organization is organized under our AZEK Exteriors, TimberTech, StruXure, INTEX, VERSATEX and ULTRALOX product lines and is composed of a general sales organization, which is primarily geographically based, and also includes specialty sales organizations who focus on exterior trim, railing, retail and key accounts. Our sales organization is primarily focused on generating downstream demand with contractors, architects and builders as well as maintaining relationships with and educating influencers. We believe we can continue to leverage our downstream investments to accelerate material conversion in our markets, strengthen our position in the pro channel and enhance our retail presence. 
 We maintain a national sales organization that works with builders and supports certain national or large regional dealers with multiple locations and/or buying groups to provide a single point of contact and more effectively serve these customers. Our national sales organization is focused on increased penetration into these accounts by working with corporate decision makers and with buyers at the local level. We have also enhanced our retail-focused sales team, who is focused on supporting individual retail locations, training pro desk associates within retail locations and facilitating deliveries for special orders placed at home improvement retailers. 
 We maintain comprehensive marketing campaigns using various media in support of our brands, targeted towards growing our dealer base, as well as acquisition and engagement of customer groups such as architects, builders, remodelers, contractors and consumers. We continue to invest in our marketing organization and prioritize demand generation and brand building amongst consumer and pro audiences. Our elevated brand positioning, diverse digital strategy, consistent media presence and experiences drive increased engagement with a variety of customer groups as well as affinity among consumer and professional influencers. Our digital platform facilitates the consumer journey from inspiration and design to installation. The experience educates consumers on the benefits of our products versus traditional materials, utilizes digital visualization tools to allow consumers to re-imagine their outdoor living spaces and directly connects users to pre-qualified local contractors and dealers. We enjoy strong preference for our products among professional contractors, who typically purchase our products at dealers, and we are investing in improved merchandising at pro locations and retailers as the majority of consumers include visits to home improvement locations as they research decking and outdoor living projects. These consumer engagement strategies are focused on creating additional brand differentiation, pull-through demand and accelerating our growth. In addition, we have augmented our advertising efforts by reinforcing the “Timber” and the “Tech” messaging and developing educational, simplified and visually appealing product displays, marketing tools and sample kits to market our products across channels. 
 We also provide frequent demonstrations, education, product training and other sales and loyalty initiatives to help drive awareness, reinforce key selling points and installation best practices. We operate in-person and virtual AZEK University classes to educate distributors, dealers, contractors, architects and builders via classroom tutorials, hands-on sessions and plant tours. In addition, through our AZEK Pro Rewards program, we seek to secure preferred brand status with contractors by providing them with marketing tools, leads and various other rewards in connection with increased purchases of our products. We believe these efforts increase our market position because many buying decisions involve input from both the contractor and consumer, with consumers frequently relying on contractor recommendations. 
 Commercial Segment 
 Our Vycom sales organization focuses on providing engineered polymer solutions for a wide variety of Industries, including the graphic displays and signage, semiconductor, marine, chemical and corrosion, recreation and playground and food processing markets. Our Vycom products are sold to plastics distributors in the United States, Canada and Latin America, who sell primarily to OEMs, and in certain cases are sold directly to OEMs. The Vycom sales force is made up of a combination of direct territory managers and manufacturing representatives focused on increasing market penetration by working with printers, fabricators, OEMs and end-users to generate demand for Vycom materials. 
 As of September 30, 2022, Scranton Products utilized direct sales and regional manufacturers’ sales representatives to provide coverage to a network of approximately 850 dealers who sell to institutional and commercial customers across the United States and in 
 12

Canada. The Scranton Products’ sales force and agents service architects and facility managers to create pull-through demand in traditional institutional markets, such as schools, universities and stadium arenas, and in targeted new markets, such as retail stores, commercial and professional buildings, industrial facilities and food processing plants. Our Scranton Products sales force has leveraged a leading market position, enhanced promotional materials and specialized products to develop close relationships with architects and assist them in designing products and has enhanced awareness of the benefits of our products through targeted efforts to educate architects and designers. 
 Raw Materials and Suppliers 
 The primary raw materials used in our products are various petrochemical resins, including polyethylene, polypropylene and PVC resins, reclaimed polyethylene and PVC material, waste wood fiber and aluminum. We also utilize other additives, including modifiers, titanium dioxide, or TiO2, and pigments. Our contracts with key suppliers are typically short term in nature, with terms generally ranging from one to three years. We have not entered into hedges of our raw material costs at this time, but we may choose to enter into such hedges in the future, and our supply contracts with our major vendors do not contain obligations to sell raw materials to us at a fixed price. Prices for spot market purchases are negotiated on a continuous basis in line with current market prices. Other than short term supply contracts for resins with indexed based pricing and occasional strategic purchases of larger quantities of certain raw materials, we generally buy materials on an as-needed basis. 
 The cost of petrochemical resins used in our manufacturing processes has historically varied significantly and has been affected by changes in supply and demand and in the price of crude oil. Substantially all of our resins are purchased under supply contracts that average approximately one to two years, for which pricing is variable based on an industry benchmark price index. The resin supply contracts are negotiated annually and generally provide that we are obligated to purchase a minimum amount of resins from each supplier. In addition, the price of reclaimed polyethylene material, waste wood fiber, aluminum, other additives (including modifiers, TiO2 and pigments) and other raw materials fluctuates depending on, among other things, overall market supply and demand and general economic conditions. We seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in our raw material costs by broadening our supplier base, increasing our use of recycled material, increasing our use of scrap and reducing waste and exploring options for material substitution without sacrificing quality. For example, between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2022, we have invested over $75 million to enhance our recycling capabilities and have increased our use of “regrind,” through the collection and reprocessing of scrap generated in our manufacturing processes. 
 Although we do not rely on any single supplier for the majority of our raw materials, we do obtain certain raw materials from single or a limited number of suppliers. In particular, we rely on a single supplier for certain critical capped compounds used in our decking and railing products. If one or more suppliers were unable to satisfy our requirements for particular raw materials, we could experience a disruption to our operations as alternative suppliers are identified and qualified and new supply arrangements are entered into. 
 Competition 
 We compete with multiple companies, including divisions or subsidiaries of larger companies and foreign competitors. We compete on the basis of a number of considerations, including service, quality, performance, product characteristics, brand recognition and loyalty, marketing, product development, sales and distribution and price. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. 
Residential Segment 
 Our residential products compete primarily with products made from wood, aluminum and engineered wood that our products are designed to replace. We also compete with other manufacturers of engineered products designed to replace wood and other traditional materials, including Trex Company Inc., Fiberon, LLC, a subsidiary of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc., Deckorators, a subsidiary of UFP Industries, Inc., Oldcastle APG, Inc., Westlake Corp., including Westlake Royal Building Products and Kleer Lumber, and CertainTeed Corporation. 
Commercial Segment 
 Our Vycom products compete in a highly fragmented market. Manufacturers generally focus on a few core materials sold to narrow sub-segments through a specialized distribution network. Competitors for other non-fabricated products include other national and regional manufacturers like Mitsubishi Chemical Advanced Materials (formerly Quadrant EPP), Rochling Engineering Plastics, 3A Composites USA Inc., Simona AG and Kommerling Plastics USA. 
 The bathroom partition and locker market is also highly fragmented and is addressed by manufacturers producing products in a variety of different materials and at varying price ranges. Scranton Products’ primary plastic bath and locker competitors are Global Partitions Corp. (d/b/a ASI Global Partitions), Hadrian Manufacturing Inc. and Bradley Corporation. 
 13

Seasonality 
 Although we generally experience demand for our products throughout the year, our sales have historically experienced some seasonality. We have typically experienced moderately higher levels of sales of our residential products in the second fiscal quarter of the year as a result of our “early buy” sales and extended payment terms typically available during the second fiscal quarter of the year. As a result of these extended payment terms, our accounts receivable have typically reached seasonal peaks at the end of the second fiscal quarter of the year, and our net cash provided by operating activities has typically been lower in the second fiscal quarter relative to other quarters. In addition, our sales are affected by the individual decisions of distributors and dealers on the levels of inventory they carry, their views on product demand, their financial condition and the manner in which they choose to manage inventory risk. Our sales are also generally impacted by the number of days in a quarter or a year that contractors and other professionals are able to install our products. This can vary dramatically based on, among other things, weather events such as rain, snow and extreme temperatures. We have generally experienced lower levels of sales of our residential products in the first fiscal quarter due to adverse weather conditions in certain markets, which typically reduces the construction and renovation activity during the winter season. In addition, we have experienced higher levels of sales of bathroom partition products and our locker products during the second half of our fiscal year, which includes the summer months during which schools are typically closed and are more likely to undergo remodel activities. 
Intellectual Property 
 We rely on trademark and service mark protection to protect our brands, and we have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks and service marks. In particular, we believe the AZEK and AZEK Exteriors brands, the TimberTech brand, the VERSATEX brand, the StruXure brand and the FULL-CIRCLE brand, including FULL-CIRCLE PVC Recycling and FULL-CIRCLE Recycling, are significant to the success of our business. We also rely on a combination of unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and to a lesser extent, patents to preserve our position in the market. As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 375 trademark registrations and 167 issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and other countries. As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 109 issued U.S. patents and 21 U.S. patent applications pending. We also had approximately 25 issued foreign patents and 12 foreign patent applications pending. As we develop technologies and processes that we believe are innovative, we intend to continually assess the patentability of new intellectual property. In addition, we employ various other methods, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with third parties and employees who have access to trade secrets, to protect our trade secrets and know-how. Our intellectual property rights may be challenged by third parties and may not be effective in excluding competitors from using the same or similar technologies, brands or works. 
Employees and Human Capital
 We have adopted human capital and human rights management policies to further our commitment to social responsibility. Our culture is driven by a shared passion for our values, mission and performance. It is an inclusive culture of innovative, growth-minded individuals driven by our value to always do the right thing and committed to continuous improvement and solving problems for our customers and partners. 
 The members of our management team and our board of directors come from diverse backgrounds, and we have implemented recruitment strategies that enable us to hire and retain diverse and highly talented employees that bring a diverse range of thought and skills to the business. In our employee selection process and the operation of our business, we adhere to equal employment opportunity policies. We have also committed to include diverse candidates in any pool of candidates from which employees are chosen. Additionally, we work to build an inclusive culture of continued learning by offering a comprehensive training program which includes diversity-focused and leadership development trainings in order to provide employees opportunities to broaden their perspective and develop their skills in application to the business.
 We compensate our employees according to our fair remuneration policies and believe deeply in paying for performance. We also provide attractive benefits that promote the health and financial wellness of our employees and their families, as well as opportunities for our employees to participate in and give back to their communities, including through volunteer activities and a charitable matching program. Our employees frequently hear from executive management, especially the Chief Executive Officer, who leads all-employee town halls where he provides business updates, aligns employees to our mission and values, and answers questions submitted directly from employees.
 We measure our ability to achieve our human capital objectives by regularly conducting small employee focus groups that are led by our CEO and other members of management and by conducting employee engagement surveys on an annual basis. The results of these focus groups and surveys allow us to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement to ensure continued engagement, satisfaction and retention of our employees.
 As of September 30, 2022, we had 2,182 full-time employees. Our workforce is not unionized, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees.

Environmental Laws and Regulations; Health and Safety
 Our operations and properties are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local environmental protection laws, regulations and ordinances. These laws, regulations and ordinances, among other matters, govern activities and operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air, soil and water, and establish standards for the handling of hazardous and toxic substances and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. We are also subject to permitting requirements under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Those requirements obligate us to obtain permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to conduct our operations. We believe we comply in all material respects with environmental laws and regulations and possess the permits required to operate our manufacturing and other facilities. Our environmental compliance costs in the future will depend, in part, on the nature and extent of our manufacturing activities, regulatory developments and future requirements that cannot presently be predicted. 
 We are also subject to workplace safety regulation by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and state and local regulators. Our health and safety policies and practices include an employee training and competency development program to regularly train, verify and encourage compliance with health and safety procedures and regulations.
