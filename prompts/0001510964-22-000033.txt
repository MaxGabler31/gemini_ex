ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
CV Sciences, Inc. ("CV Sciences," "we," "our" or "us") is a life science company that operates two distinct business segments: (i) a consumer product division focused on developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling plant-based dietary supplements and hemp-based cannabidiol ("CBD") products to a range of market sectors; and (ii) a specialty pharmaceutical segment focused on developing and commercializing CBD-based novel therapeutics. The Company’s consumer products are marketed and sold at more than 8,400 retail locations throughout the United States. According to SPINS, a leading provider of syndicated data and insights for the natural, organic, and specialty products industry, the Company's PlusCBD™ product is the top-selling brand of hemp-derived CBD in the natural product retail market. Our state-of-the-art facility follows all guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMP") and our hemp extracts are processed, produced, and tested throughout the manufacturing process to confirm that the cannabinoid content meets strict company standards. With a commitment to science, the benefits of our products when utilized by individuals that are in good health are supported by human clinical research data and three published clinical case studies available on PubMed.gov. In addition, PlusCBD™ was the first hemp CBD supplement brand to invest in the scientific evidence necessary to achieve self-affirmed Generally Recognized as Safe ("GRAS") status. Our primary offices and facilities are located in San Diego, California.

Hemp-based CBD is one of more than 100 cannabinoids found in hemp and is non-psychoactive. Our U.S. based operations oversee our raw material supply chain, raw material processing, product development and manufacturing, and sales and marketing. We will continue to scale operations to accommodate market conditions.
Specialty Pharmaceuticals
Our specialty pharmaceutical segment is developing cannabinoids intended to treat medical indications. Cannabinoids are compounds derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, which contains two primary cannabinoids, CBD, and tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Clinical and preclinical data suggest that CBD has promising results in treating a range of medical indications. We acquired drug development assets utilizing CBD as the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our CanX acquisition.
Our first product candidate, CVSI-007, combines CBD and nicotine in treatment of smokeless tobacco use and addiction. There are currently no drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for treatment of smokeless tobacco use and addiction. The worldwide smokeless tobacco addiction treatment market is estimated at greater than $2 billion. We believe this product candidate will provide treatment options for this significant unmet medical need. CVSI-007 is based on proprietary formulations, processes and technology. In May 2016, we filed a patent application for the technology implemented for CVSI-007 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). On May 19, 2020, we received a formal notice of issuance from the USPTO for our patent application 15/426,617. The patent covers methods of treating smokeless tobacco addiction by administering pharmaceutical formulations containing CBD and nicotine. We are pursuing similar patent protection in other key markets throughout the world. In 2020, we received a notice of allowance from the Japan Patent Office. 
We expect to continue our development efforts as we seek approval from the FDA to commercialize the world's first and only FDA-approved treatment for smokeless tobacco addiction. We currently contract with qualified parties and contract research organizations for our preclinical research and Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) preparation and development. Commercialization of future specialty pharmaceutical products in the United States and other territories may rely on licensing and co-promotion agreements with strategic partners. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States, such commercial infrastructure could include a sales organization, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. However, we anticipate that building such a commercial infrastructure will require significant investment.
Description of our Subsidiaries
CV Sciences was incorporated under the name Foreclosure Solutions, Inc. in the State of Texas on December 9, 2010. On July 25, 2013, CannaVest Corp., a Texas corporation (“CannaVest Texas”), merged with CV Sciences, a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary of CannaVest Texas, to effectuate a change in the Company’s state of incorporation from Texas to Delaware. On January 4, 2016, we filed a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation reflecting our corporate name change to “CV Sciences, Inc.”, effective on January 5, 2016. In addition, on January 4, 2016, we amended our Bylaws to reflect our corporate name change to “CV Sciences, Inc.” As of the date of this report, we don't own any interest in any subsidiaries. 
Government Regulation
We are subject to local and federal laws and regulations pertaining to the sale of hemp derived CBD products in our operating jurisdictions. We maintain required licenses for sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution; we also monitor changes in laws, regulations, treaties, and agreements. 
The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, known as the "2018 Farm Bill", is United States federal legislation signed into law on December 20, 2018, that provides the legal framework for hemp-based products. The 2018 Farm Bill permanently removed “hemp” from the purview of the Controlled Substances Act, and accordingly, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) no longer has any claim to interfere with the interstate commerce of hemp products. Some of the immediate impact from 
this legislation includes the ability for hemp farmers to access crop insurance and U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) programs for competitive grants. 
Notwithstanding the removal of the DEA from enforcement of hemp regulations; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) retains authority to regulate ingestible and topical hemp products, including hemp extracts that contain CBD. Although no longer a controlled substance under federal law, cannabinoids derived from industrial hemp are still subject to a patchwork of state regulations. We have dedicated staff that actively monitors state regulations and proposed regulations to ensure compliance.
A range of federal laws and regulations govern sourcing, manufacturing, distribution, sales, and marketing of hemp-derived CBD products in the U.S. Products sold for oral consumption as liquids, tablets, capsules, softgels, or gummies are under the purview of The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”). Under DSHEA, supplement manufacturing is regulated by the FDA for current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) under 21 CFR Part 111. Furthermore, DSHEA defines a “dietary supplement” as a product intended to supplement the diet that contains one or more of the following: (a) a vitamin; (b) a mineral; (c) an herb or other botanical; (d) an amino acid; (e) a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or (f) a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described in clause (a) through (e). Thus, the law permits a wide range of dietary ingredients in dietary supplements, including CBD, which is an extract of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), which is a legal botanical. CBD also falls under clause (e) as it is a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake.
In conjunction with the enactment of the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA released a statement about the regulatory status of CBD. The statement noted that the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly preserved the FDA’s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. This authority allows the FDA to continue enforcing the law to protect the public while also providing potential regulatory pathways for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds. The statement also noted the growing public interest in cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including CBD, and informed the public that the FDA will treat products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds as it does any other FDA-regulated products — meaning the products will be subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated products containing any other substance, regardless of the source of the substance, including whether the substance is derived from a plant that is classified as hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill. The FDA’s CBD enforcement discretion and regulatory actions with regards to CBD provide regulatory guidance to the CBD industry. 
In October 2021, Assembly Bill 45 passed in California, permitting the retail sale of products containing hemp-derived CBD including dietary supplements, topicals, over-the-counter and pet products. 
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and based upon publicly available information, to our knowledge the FDA has not taken any enforcement actions against CBD companies that are compliant with the FDCA. The FDA, however, has sent Warning Letters to companies demanding they cease and desist from the production, distribution, or advertising of CBD products when these companies have made prohibited, misleading, and unapproved drug claims. We continue to monitor the FDA’s position on CBD.
We are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information; the handling of customer complaints; the requirement to provide warnings about exposures to chemicals with adverse health effects; and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. 
The growth and demand for online commerce has resulted in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online companies. These laws cover issues such as user privacy, spyware and the tracking of consumer activities, marketing e-mails and communications, other advertising and promotional practices, money transfers, pricing, product safety, content and quality of products and services, taxation, electronic contracts and other communications and information security.
There is uncertainty over whether or how existing laws governing issues such as sales and other taxes, auctions, libel, and personal privacy apply to the internet and commercial online services. These issues are predicted to take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities in some states, as well as a Congressional advisory commission, are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce. Furthermore, new state tax regulations may subject CV Sciences to additional state sales and income taxes. Other areas that may result in significant additional taxes or regulatory restrictions include, without limitation, new legislation or regulation; the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply; or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and commercial online services. These taxes or restrictions could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, output, and overall financial condition. Furthermore, there is a possibility that we may be financially responsible for past failures to comply with requirements.
Sales and Distribution
Our products are currently sold online through our websites (www.pluscbdoil.com and www.cvsciences.com), select distributors, brick and mortar retailers, and select e-tailers. We have relationships with wholesalers, distributors and retailers across the food, drug and mass ("FDM"), natural product, specialty, professional market, and convenience industries. We utilize our knowledgeable partners to display and present our products to customers in their brick and mortar stores. These relationships are important to ensure consumers across a variety of sales channels have access to our products. These partnerships and our expansive distribution allow us to build consumer trust in our brand and products. We have additional partners in the natural product channel to service our retail customers by stocking and displaying products and explaining product attributes and health benefits. We also utilize e-commerce platforms to reach consumers and guide them through the CBD buying process as we believe consumers rely heavily on digital research. 
Markets, Geography, Seasonality, and Major Customers
Our products are predominantly sold in North America and primarily in the retail space. Based on our current and historical balance sheets and statement of operations, it does not appear that our business or operations experience any seasonality with respect to our sales as any such seasonality appears to be unpredictable. Although we believe our customers’ historical buying patterns and budgetary cycles may be a factor that impacts our annual and quarterly sales results, we are not able to reliably predict our sales based on seasonality because outside factors (timing of orders, introduction of new products, and other economic factors impacting our industry) can also substantially impact our sales patterns during the year.
Furthermore, because the majority of our sales are spread amongst various retailers, distributors, and direct consumers, our largest customer only accounted for approximately 4% of our sales. As a result, we do not believe our financial condition and results of operations is dependent on any one particular major customer. 
Working Capital Items
Our inventory levels are currently adequate for our short-term needs based upon present level of demand. We consider our products to be generally available and current suppliers to be reliable and capable of satisfying anticipated needs.
Competition
The CBD-based consumer product industry is highly competitive and fragmented with numerous companies, consisting of publicly- and privately-owned companies, such as Charlotte's Web Holdings Inc., cbdMD, Inc., Medterra CBD, Inc., and many others. There are also large, well-funded companies that have indicated their intention to compete in the hemp-based product category in the U.S. We routinely evaluate internal and external opportunities to optimize value for shareholders through new product development or by asset acquisitions or sales and believe we are well-positioned to capitalize in the growing CBD product category. 
There are several companies developing cannabinoid therapeutics for a range of medical indications. The cannabinoid therapeutic area currently includes formulated extracts of the Cannabis plant and synthetic formulations. These formulations include CBD or THC, or a combination of CBD and THC as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Certain companies such as GW Pharmaceuticals plc have focused on plant-based CBD formulations, while other companies such as Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Insys Therapeutics, Inc. have focused on synthetic CBD formulations.
Intellectual Property
We have filed trademark applications on our brands, logos and marks in the U.S. and internationally. On January 30, 2016, we received a Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for our utility patent application number 14/791,184, Novel Process for Generating Hemp Oil with a High CBD Content. This patent covers our solvent-free and highly repeatable process for producing hemp oil with higher concentrations of CBD and expires in 2033.
In May 2016, we filed a patent application for our product candidate CVSI-007 with the USPTO. On May 19, 2020, we received formal notice of issuance from the USPTO for our patent application 15/426,617. The patent covers methods of treating smokeless tobacco addiction by administering pharmaceutical formulations containing CBD and nicotine. We are pursuing similar patent protection in other key markets throughout the world. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received a notice of allowance from the Japan Patent Office.
We review our intellectual property portfolio on a periodic basis, and we will continue to broaden our portfolio in a fiscally prudent manner. We rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. 
Research and Development
Our research and development costs have consisted primarily of salaries and related personnel expense, facilities and equipment expense and other costs related to both our consumer product and drug development business segments. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred in the ongoing development of new consumer products and in development of our drug candidate CVSI-007. We established a cross-functional innovation process for our consumer products development using a modified stage gate process. Our new product development activities include ideation and feasibility, product development, scaleup and validation, and product launch. We incurred research and development expenses of $1.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Raw Materials and Product Manufacturing
We have invested significant capital to develop and maintain relationships with growers on a global scale to ensure access to raw materials to support anticipated revenue growth. We have historically sourced our raw materials from well-established and well-recognized hemp growers in Europe. In addition, we have developed relationships with hemp growers in the United States and purchase raw materials domestically as well. We have maintained access to these growers for their raw material supply and continue to explore and develop other relationships to ensure that we can meet the expected demand for hemp-based consumer products well into the future. 
We are committed to producing a quality product and testing transparency. Our goals include the optimization of our product manufacturing processes and the sourcing of reliable, high-quality raw materials. Our testing procedures are robust and comprehensive, starting with a supply chain built through our supplier verification program. All incoming cannabinoid ingredients are required to be first tested by the supplier at an independent, ISO accredited, third-party laboratory before they reach our production facilities and a Certificate of Analysis provided with each delivery. We then have the cannabinoid ingredients re-tested by an independent, ISO accredited, third-party laboratory to verify the supplier results before they are released into our production process. We test in-house throughout the production process before sending the finished goods off for final verification by an independent ISO accredited third-party laboratory to ensure the finished products meet our high standards. 
We are dedicated to providing the highest quality CBD consumer products on the market. We strive to meet or exceed the FDAs GMP guidelines. These guidelines provide a system of processes, procedures and documentation to assure a product has the identity, strength, composition, quality and purity that appear on its label. Our third party manufacturers use FDA-registered facilities which are independently GMP certified and subject to continuing independent audit and certification. 
Environmental Matters
No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from the Company's operations, and it is not anticipated that our operations will be materially affected by federal, state or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental health and safety requirements have not been material. 
Furthermore, compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had, nor are they expected to have, any material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company. However, we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.
Employees
We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 71 employees, which included 69 full-time and 2 part-time employees. In addition to our full-time employees, we contract with third-parties for the conduct of certain marketing, sales and manufacturing efforts as well as certain preclinical, clinical and manufacturing activities related to drug development efforts. Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of our core values. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in an effort to protect our employees, so they can more safely and effectively perform their work. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and none are represented by labor unions. Management believes the Company has good relationships with its employees.
