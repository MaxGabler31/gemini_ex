 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
     GENERAL
    
Atlantic Power is an independent power producer that owns power generation assets in nine states in the United States and two provinces in Canada. Our power generation projects, which are diversified by geography, fuel type, dispatch profile and offtaker, sell electricity to utilities and other large customers predominantly under long‑term PPAs, which seek to minimize exposure to changes in commodity prices. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of seventeen projects operating or under contract with an aggregate electric generating capacity of approximately 1,598 megawatts (“MW”) on a gross ownership basis and approximately 1,252 MW on a net ownership basis. Fourteen of the projects are majority‑owned by the Company. Two of our Ontario projects totaling 80 MW on a gross and net ownership basis have not operated since the expiration of their contracts on December 31, 2017. In early February 2018, our three plants in San Diego, totaling 112 MW on a gross and net ownership basis, ceased operations and will be decommissioned, as discussed in Our Organization and Segments. 
     The following charts show, based on generation capacity in MW, the diversification of our portfolio by segment and fuel type for our projects currently in operation:

     We sell the majority of the capacity and energy from our power generation projects under PPAs to a variety of utilities and other parties. Under the PPAs, which have expiration dates ranging from June 30, 2019 to March 31, 2037, we receive payments for electric energy sold to our customers (known as energy payments), in addition to payments for electric generation capacity (known as capacity payments). We also sell steam from a number of our projects to industrial purchasers under steam sales agreements. Sales of electricity are generally higher during the summer and winter months, when temperature extremes create demand for either summer cooling or winter heating.
     We directly operate and maintain the majority of our power generation projects. We also partner with recognized leaders in the independent power industry to operate and maintain our other projects, including Heorot Power Management LLC (“Heorot”) and Purenergy LLC (“Purenergy”). Under these operation, maintenance and management agreements, the operator is typically responsible for operations, maintenance and repair services.
     HISTORY OF OUR COMPANY
     Atlantic Power Corporation is a corporation continued under the laws of British Columbia, Canada, which was incorporated in 2004. We used the proceeds from our initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) in November 2004 to acquire a 58% interest in Atlantic Power Holdings, LLC (which we refer to herein as “Atlantic Holdings”) from two private equity funds managed by ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC (“ArcLight”) and from Caithness Energy, LLC (“Caithness”). Until December 31, 2009, we were externally managed under an agreement with Atlantic Power Management, LLC, an affiliate of ArcLight, when we agreed to pay ArcLight an aggregate of $15 million to terminate its management agreement with us. In connection with the termination of the management agreement, we 

 
  4

 
hired all of the then‑current employees of Atlantic Power Management and entered into employment agreements with its three officers.
     At the time of our initial public offering, our publicly traded security was an Income Participating Security (“IPS”), which was comprised of one common share and a subordinated note. In November 2009, our shareholders approved a conversion from the IPS structure to a traditional common share structure in which each IPS was exchanged for one new common share and each old common share that did not form a part of an IPS was exchanged for approximately 0.44 of a new common share. Our common shares trade on the TSX under the symbol “ATP”. On July 23, 2010, we also began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “AT”.
     On November 5, 2011, we directly and indirectly acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited partnership units of Capital Power Income L.P., which was renamed Atlantic Power Limited Partnership on February 1, 2012 (the “Partnership”). The Partnership’s portfolio consisted of 19 wholly‑owned power generation assets located in both Canada and the United States, a 50.15% interest in a power generation asset in the state of Washington, and a 14.3% common ownership interest in Primary Energy Recycling Holdings, LLC which was later sold in 2012. At the acquisition date, the transaction increased the net generating capacity of our projects by 143% from 871 MW to approximately 2,116 MW.
    
On June 26, 2015, we sold our 100% ownership interest in Meadow Creek Project Company, LLC (“Meadow Creek”), 99% ownership in Canadian Hills Wind, LLC (“Canadian Hills”), 50% ownership interest in Rockland Wind Farm, LLC (“Rockland”), 27.6% ownership interest in Idaho Wind Partners 1, LLC (“Idaho Wind”) and 12.5% ownership interest in Goshen Phase II, LLC (“Goshen”) (collectively, the “Wind Projects”), totaling 521 MW net ownership to TerraForm AP Acquisition Holdings, LLC (“TerraForm”), an affiliate of SunEdison, Inc.
     OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY
     General
     Our business strategy is to increase the intrinsic value of the Company on a per-share basis. An important element of that strategy is strengthening our balance sheet and financial flexibility by continuing to reduce our debt and interest costs significantly. We also continue to evaluate our overhead and operating costs for further cost savings opportunities. We use our depth of operational and commercial experience to enhance the operating, contractual and financial performance of our current portfolio of projects, and to extend or renew expiring PPAs for our projects when it is economically feasible to do so. In allocating discretionary capital we are guided by the price-to-value relationship and the impact on intrinsic value per share. We rank the various potential uses – organic growth, external investments and acquisitions, and repurchases of our debt and equity securities – on that basis. With respect to organic growth, we have made optimization investments (to improve efficiency or reliability or increase capacity) in our existing projects that have produced cash returns higher than those currently available externally. We may undertake additional investments to repower certain facilities in conjunction with extensions of existing PPAs, if the returns are attractive. We believe that we have a highly disciplined and opportunistic approach to external growth, with a focus on out-of-favor assets. We will use discretionary cash for repurchases of our debt and equity securities only when the price-to-value level is compelling. 
     Extending PPAs following their expiration
     PPAs in our portfolio have expiration dates ranging from June 30, 2019 to March 31, 2037. We plan for PPA expirations by evaluating various options in the market. New arrangements may involve responses to utility solicitations for capacity and energy, direct negotiations with the original purchasing utility for PPA extensions, approaches by the projects to likely bilateral counterparties, including traditional PPAs, tolling agreements with creditworthy energy trading firms or the use of derivatives to lock in value. The current market for PPAs is challenging. When a PPA expires or is terminated, it is possible that the price received by the project for power under subsequent arrangements, if any, may be reduced and in some cases, significantly. We do not assume that revenues or operating margins under existing PPAs will necessarily be sustained after PPA expirations, since most original PPAs included capacity payments related to return of and return on original capital invested, and counterparties or evolving regional electricity markets may or may not provide similar payments under new or extended PPAs. Our projects may not be able to secure a new agreement 

 
  5

 
and could be exposed to selling power at spot market prices. It is possible that subsequent PPAs or the spot markets may not be available at prices that permit the operation of the project on a profitable basis, which may result in our decision to mothball or retire the project. For the status of description of some of our PPAs and related renegotiations, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risk Related to Our Business and Our Projects—The expiration or termination of our PPAs could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.” 
     Organic growth
     We plan to continue to enhance the operational and financial performance of our projects by improving their operating efficiencies, output, reliability and operation and maintenance costs through investments to upgrade or enhance existing equipment or plant configurations. We also seek to optimize commercial arrangements such as PPAs, fuel supply and transportation contracts, steam sales agreements, operations and maintenance agreements and hedging arrangements.  To the extent we achieve PPA extensions or new contracts on economically feasible terms, and we have sufficient cash flow or are able to obtain financing, we may expand or repower existing projects, or develop new long-term contracted plants with industrial customers.
     External Growth & Acquisitions
     We pursue external growth opportunities consistent with our strategy to maximize the intrinsic value of the Company on a per-share basis. Our acquisition strategy is focused on power generation assets in operation in the United States and Canada, targeting out-of-favor assets with a compelling price-to-value relationship. We may also pursue the greenfield development of new power generation projects when a favorable risk/reward balance exists.             OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
     We have the following competitive strengths:
    
· | Diversified projects. Our power generation projects in operation or under contract have an aggregate gross electric generation capacity of approximately 1,598 MW, and our net ownership interest in these projects is approximately 1,252 MW at December 31, 2018. These projects are diversified by fuel type, electricity and steam customers, technologies, project operators and geography. The majority are located in the U.S. Eastern, Mid‑Atlantic and Midwest regions, and the province of British Columbia.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Experienced management team. Our management team has a depth of experience in commercial power operations and maintenance, project development, asset management, mergers and acquisitions, capital raising and management and financial controls.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Stability of project cash flow. Many of our power generation projects currently in operation have been in operation for more than ten years. Cash flows from each project are generally supported by PPAs with investment‑grade utilities and other creditworthy counterparties. We aim to stabilize operating margins through a combination of a project’s PPAs, fuel supply agreements and/or commodity hedges, when possible. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong in‑house operations and asset management teams. We manage the operations of fourteen of our seventeen operating power generation projects, which represent approximately 62% of our portfolio’s total net generating capacity. The remaining three generation projects are operated by third parties, which are recognized leaders in the independent power business.

 ASSET MANAGEMENT
     Our asset management strategy is to manage our physical assets and commercial relationships to increase shareholder value. We proactively seek scale opportunities and to establish best practices that result in EBITDA and cash flow growth across all of our seventeen operating plants. Our asset management group works to ensure that our projects receive appropriate preventative and corrective maintenance and incur capital expenditures to provide for their safety, efficiency, availability, flexibility, longevity, and growth in EBITDA contribution. We also proactively look for opportunities to optimize power purchase, fuel supply, long‑term service and other agreements to deliver strong and predictable financial performance. The teams at each of the businesses have extensive experience in managing, operating and maintaining the assets.
     For operations and maintenance services at the three projects in our portfolio which we do not operate, we partner with experienced operators in the independent power business. Examples of our third‑party operators include Heorot and Purenergy, which are experienced, well regarded energy infrastructure management services companies. In addition, employees of Atlantic Power with significant experience managing similar assets are involved in all significant decisions with the objective of proactively identifying value‑creating opportunities such as contract renewals or restructurings, asset‑level refinancings, add‑on acquisitions, divestitures and participation at partnership meetings and calls.
     OUR ORGANIZATION AND SEGMENTS
     The following tables outline by segment our portfolio of power generating assets in operation as of December 31, 2018, including our interest in each facility. We believe our portfolio is well diversified in terms of electricity and steam customers, fuel type, regulatory jurisdictions and regional power pools, thereby partially mitigating exposure to market, regulatory or environmental conditions specific to any single region.
     We have four reportable segments: East U.S., West U.S., Canada and Un‑Allocated Corporate. The segment classified as Un‑Allocated Corporate includes activities that support the executive and administrative offices, capital structure and costs of being a public registrant. These costs are not allocated to the operating segments when determining segment profit or loss.
     The sections below provide descriptions of our projects as they are aligned in our segment reporting structure for financial reporting purposes.
     East U.S. Segment
     Our East U.S. segment accounted for 56.2%, 33.7% and 35.7% of consolidated revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and total net generation capacity of 531 MW at December 31, 2018. Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation accounted for 15.1% of total consolidated revenues and 26.8% of total revenues from the East U.S. segment for the year ended December 31, 2018.

 General
     Historically, the North American electricity industry was characterized by vertically integrated monopolies. During the late 1980s, several jurisdictions began a process of restructuring by moving away from vertically integrated monopolies toward more competitive market models. Rapid growth in electricity demand, environmental concerns, increasing electricity rates, technological advances and other concerns prompted government policies to encourage the supply of electricity from independent power producers. More recently, the North American electricity industry has become more diversified but faces the challenges of declining reserve margins and energy prices and uncertainty resulting from environmental regulations.
     According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s (“NERC”) 2018 Long‑Term Reliability Assessment (“LTRA”), published in December 2018, the 10-year forecast compound annual growth rate of the peak summer and winter electricity demand has leveled off, but remains historically low. The LTRA reference case shows a compound annual growth rate of 0.6% for both the summer and winter seasons. This growth rate is consistent with the 2017 LTRA. However, the projected growth rate was 1.5% just a decade earlier. These growth rates are expected to continue to decline due to the increase in energy efficiency and conservation programs as well as the continued growth of distributed solar and other storage sources.
     Despite recent and projected low demand growth, regions where we operate are projected to have reserve margin shortfalls or reserve margins that are lower than NERC’s reference reserve margin level. According to the LTRA, the North American electric power system is undergoing a significant transformation with ongoing retirements of fossil-fired and nuclear capacity as well as growth in natural gas, wind, and solar resources. This shift is caused by several drivers, such as existing and proposed federal, state, and provincial environmental regulations as well as low natural gas prices, in addition to the ongoing integration of both distributed and utility-scale renewable resources. Natural gas-fired generation surpassed coal as the predominant fuel source for electric generation and is the leading fuel type for capacity additions.
     Non‑utility power generation 
     The electric power industry is one of the largest industries in the United States, generating annualized retail electricity sales of approximately $370 billion through November 2018, based on information published by the Energy Information Administration, an increase from $359 billion during the same period of 2017. A significant portion of the power produced in the United States and Canada is generated by non‑utility generators. According to the Energy Information Administration, independent power producers represented approximately 40% of total net generation in 2018. Independent power producers sell the electricity that they generate to electric utilities and other load‑serving entities (such as municipalities and electric cooperatives) by way of bilateral contracts or open power exchanges. The electric utilities and other load‑serving entities, in turn, generally sell this electricity to industrial, commercial and residential customers. In the independent power generation sector, electricity is generated from a number of energy sources, including natural gas, coal, water, waste products such as biomass (e.g., wood, wood waste, agricultural waste), landfill gas, geothermal, solar and wind. All of our plants are non‑utility electric generating facilities in the North American electrical power generation industry.
     Competition
     The power generation industry is characterized by intense competition, and we compete with utilities, industrial companies, yieldcos and other independent power producers. Historically low crude and natural gas prices as well as decreased rates of demand growth have contributed to reduced capacity and energy prices and increasing competition among generators to obtain power sales agreements. We also compete for acquisition and joint‑venture opportunities with numerous private equity, infrastructure and pension funds, Canadian and U.S. independent power firms, utility non‑regulated subsidiaries and other strategic and financial players.

 REGULATORY MATTERS
     Overview
     Our facilities and operations are subject to laws and regulations that govern, among other things, transactions by and with purchasers of power, including utility companies, the development and construction of generation facilities, the ownership and operations of generation facilities, access to transmission, and the geographical location, zoning, land use and operation aspects of our facilities and properties, including environmental matters.
     In the United States, the power generation and sale aspects of our projects are primarily regulated by the Federal Energy Regulation Commission (“FERC”), although most of our projects benefit from the special provisions accorded to Qualifying Facilities (“QFs”) or Exempt Wholesale Generators (“EWGs”).
     In Canada, electricity generation is subject primarily to provincial regulation. Our projects in British Columbia are therefore subject to different regulatory regimes from our projects in Ontario.
     Generating projects
 United States
     Nine of our power generating projects are QFs under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended (“PURPA”), and FERC regulations. A QF falls into one or both of two primary classes, both of which would facilitate one of PURPA’s goals to more efficiently use fossil fuels to generate electricity than typical utility plants. The first class of QFs includes energy producers that generate power using renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, biomass or waste fuels. The second class of QFs includes cogeneration facilities, which must meet specific fossil fuel efficiency requirements by producing both electricity and steam versus electricity only.
     The generating projects with QF status are currently party to a PPA with a utility or have been granted authority to charge market-based rates or are exempt from FERC rate-making authority. The FERC has granted eight of the projects the authority to charge market-based rates based primarily on a finding that the projects lack market power. The projects with QF status are also exempt from state regulation respecting the rates of electric utilities and the financial or organizational regulation of electric utilities. However, state regulators may review the prudency of utilities entering into PPAs with QFs and the siting of the generation facilities. The majority of our generation is sold by QFs under PPAs that required approval by state authorities.
     PURPA, as initially implemented by the FERC, generally required that vertically integrated electric utilities purchase power from QFs at their avoided costs. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EP Act of 2005”), however, established new limits on PURPA’s requirement that electric utilities buy electricity from QFs to certain markets that lack competitive characteristics. The projects with EWG status are also exempt from state regulation respecting the rates of electric utilities.
     Notwithstanding their status as QFs and EWGs, our projects remain subject to various aspects of FERC regulation, including those relating to power marketer status and to oversight of mergers, acquisitions and investments relating to utilities under the Federal Power Act, as amended by the EP Act of 2005. Eight of our projects are also subject to reliability standards developed and enforced by NERC. NERC is a not-for-profit regulatory authority whose mission is to assure the reliability and security of the bulk power system in North America.
     Pursuant to its authority, NERC has issued, and the FERC has approved, a series of mandatory reliability standards. Users, owners and operators of the bulk power system can be penalized significantly for failing to comply with the FERC-approved reliability standards. We have designated our Manager of Operational and Regulatory Compliance to oversee compliance with reliability standards and an outside law firm specializing in this area advises us on FERC and NERC compliance, including annual compliance training for relevant employees.

 British Columbia, Canada
     The vast majority of British Columbia’s power is generated or procured by BC Hydro, which is one of the largest electric utilities in Canada. BC Hydro is owned by the Province of British Columbia and is regulated by the British Columbia Utilities Commission (the “BCUC”), which is governed by the Utilities Commission Act (British Columbia) (the “UCA”).  The BCUC is also responsible for the regulation of British Columbia’s public energy utilities including publicly owned and investor-owned utilities (i.e., independent power producers).
     BC Hydro is generally required to acquire all new power (beyond what it already generates from existing BC Hydro plants) from independent power producers.
     All contracts for electricity supply, including those between independent power producers and BC Hydro, must be filed with and approved by the BCUC.  In making its determination, the BCUC will examine whether the contract is in the public interest. The BCUC may hold a hearing in this regard. Furthermore, the BCUC may make rules governing conditions to be contained in agreements entered into by public utilities for electricity.
     Pursuant to the UCA, the BCUC has adopted the standards developed by the NERC and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (“WECC”) in respect to all generators of electricity in British Columbia, including independent power producers. As a practical matter, the BCUC appointed WECC as Administrator to assist the BCUC in carrying out the registration of parties and compliance monitoring.  
     The Clean Energy Act (the “Clean Energy Act”), which became law in 2010, sets out British Columbia’s energy objectives. The Clean Energy Act states, among other things, that British Columbia aims to accelerate and expand the development of clean and renewable energy sources in British Columbia to, among other things, promote economic development and job creation and continue to work toward the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation also explicitly states that British Columbia will encourage the use of waste heat, biogas and biomass to reduce waste. Clean Energy Production in B.C.: An inter-Agency Guidebook for Project Development, which was released by the Provincial government in 2016, is consistent with the Clean Energy Act, favors clean and renewable energy sources such as waterpower, windpower and ocean energy generation. Pursuant to the Clean Energy Act, BC Hydro is required to submit a report to the BCUC every five years outlining how it intends to meet these objectives and provide updates on its progress to date.
     Other provincial regulators in British Columbia having authority over independent power producers include the British Columbia Safety Authority, the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, and the Integrated Land Management Bureau.
     Ontario, Canada
     In Ontario, the Ontario Energy Board (“OEB”) is an administrative tribunal with overall responsibility for the regulation and supervision of the natural gas and electricity industries in Ontario and with the authority to grant or renew, and set the terms for, licenses with respect to electricity generation facilities, including our projects.
     No person is permitted to own or operate large or medium-scale electricity generation facilities in Ontario without a license from the OEB.
     The OEB’s general functions include:
    
· | Determination of the rates charged for regulated services in the electricity sector;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Licensing of market participants;
--+----------------------------------


· | Inspections, particularly with respect to compelling production of records and information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Market monitoring and reporting, including on anti-competitive practice;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  12

 


· | Consumer advocacy; and
--+-----------------------


· | Enforcement and compliance.
--+----------------------------

  The OEB has the authority effectively to modify licenses by adopting “codes” that are deemed to form part of the licenses. Furthermore, any violations of the license or other irregularities in the relationship with the OEB can result in fines. While the OEB provides reports to the Ontario Minister of Energy, it generally operates independently from the government. However, the Minister may issue policy directives (with Cabinet approval) concerning general policy and the objectives to be pursued by the OEB, and the OEB is required to implement such policy directives.
     A number of other regulators and quasi-governmental entities play a role in electricity regulation in Ontario, including the Independent Electricity System Operator (“IESO”), Hydro One, the Electrical Safety Authority (“ESA”) and the Ontario Electricity Financial Corporation (“OEFC”).
     In 1998, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed the Energy Competition Act of 1998, which authorized the establishment of a market in electricity, and reorganized Ontario Hydro into five companies: Ontario Power Generation (“OPG”), the Ontario Hydro Services Company (later renamed Hydro One), the Independent Electricity Market Operator (later renamed the IESO), the ESA, and OEFC. The two commercial companies, Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One, were intended to eventually operate as private businesses rather than as crown corporations. In the fall of 2015, the Province sold off 15% of Hydro One in an IPO with an additional 38% sold through December 31, 2017. In January of 2018, the Province sold a further 2.4% of the company’s outstanding common shares to 129 First Nations of Ontario. The Province now owns approximately 48.9% of the company’s common shares, including the 1.5% owned by Ontario Power Generation, a company wholly-owned by the Province.
     The IESO is responsible for administering the wholesale electricity market and controlling Ontario’s transmission grid. The IESO is a non-profit corporation whose directors are appointed by the government of Ontario. The IESO’s “Market Rules” form the regulatory framework for the operation of Ontario’s transmission grid and electricity market. The Market Rules require, among other things, that generators meet certain equipment and performance standards and certain system reliability obligations. The IESO may enforce the Market Rules by imposing financial penalties. The IESO may also terminate, suspend or restrict participatory rights.
     In November 2006, the IESO entered into a memorandum of understanding with NERC, in which it recognized NERC as the “electricity reliability organization” in Ontario. In addition, the IESO has also entered into a similar MOU with both the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (the “NPCC”) and NERC. The IESO is accountable to NERC and NPCC for compliance with NERC and NPCC reliability standards. Although the IESO may impose Ontario-specific reliability standards, such standards must be consistent with, and at least as stringent as, NERC’s and NPCC’s standards. Effective July 1, 2016, the IESO changed the definition of what generating facilities are considered part of the Bulk Electric System (“BES”). Any new facility grouped into the BES, which includes all Ontario sites except Kapuskasing, will have to comply with all NERC reliability standards in effect in Ontario. As of January 1, 2015, the IESO is responsible for procuring new electricity generation. As a result, the IESO enters into electricity generation contracts with electricity generators in Ontario from time to time. The IESO also administers the Ontario Reliability Compliance Program, working with various market participants to ensure they understand and adhere to their obligations.
     Although the Green Energy Act became law in Ontario in 2009 for renewable electricity generation technologies, including via a feed-in tariff program, this statute was repealed as of January 1, 2019 with the introduction and proclamation of the Green Energy Repeal Act, 2018. This Act amended provisions of the Electricity Act, 1998, as well as the Environmental Protection Act, and the Planning Act, among others. In particular, amendments to the Environmental Protection Act now provide that, absent a demonstrated demand for the electricity which would be generated by a given renewable energy project, the provincial government is empowered to prohibit the issuance or renewal of energy approvals for any such project. Amendments to the Planning Act now stipulate that there is no appeal route in respect of any refusal or failure to adopt an amendment authorizing a renewable energy undertaking, except by the Minister. Further amendments provide that there is now no appeal route in respect of all or any part of an application for amendment to a by-law if the amendment proposes to permit a renewable energy undertaking, except by the Minister. The provincial government has stated that the repeal of the Green Energy Act will empower individual 

 
  13

 
municipalities to make planning decisions related to the development of new energy projects. In July of 2018, the provincial government cancelled hundreds of renewable energy contracts in the province.  In the related Minister’s Directive, the Minister noted that the IESO’s recent system planning work “indicates that Ontario’s current contracted and rate regulated electricity resources are sufficient to satisfy or exceed forecasted provincial needs for the near term and that there are other means of meeting future energy supply and capacity needs at materially lower costs than long-term contracts that lock in the prices paid for these resources.”
     In January 2019, the provincial government initiated a consultation process in order to consider the merits of shifting to a single annual natural gas rate which will include both delivery-related and commodity-related rates.
     Carbon emissions
 United States – regional and state
     In the United States, during the past several years government actions addressing carbon emissions have occurred primarily at the regional and state levels. Beginning in 2009, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”) was established by certain Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states as the first cap-and-trade program in the United States for CO2 emissions. CO2 allowances are now a tradable commodity in the RGGI states. The nine states currently participating in RGGI have varied implementation plans and schedules. RGGI implemented a new, reduced CO2 cap in 2014, with further reductions of 2.5% each year from 2015 to 2020. On January 29, 2018, the governor of New Jersey signed an executive order directing the state’s Department of Environmental Protection and the Board of Public Utilities to take all necessary regulatory and administrative measures to ensure New Jersey’s timely return to full participation in RGGI. We have project interests in two RGGI states, New York and New Jersey. New York provides cost mitigation for independent power projects with certain types of power contracts. New Jersey, pending final legislation, is also expected to provide similar cost mitigation. California’s cap-and-trade program governing greenhouse gas emissions became effective for the electricity sector on January 1, 2013. California, along with British Columbia and Quebec, is part of the Western Climate Initiative, which supports the implementation of state and provincial greenhouse gas emissions trading programs. Other states and regions in the United States have considered similar regulations, and it is possible that federal climate legislation will be established in the future.
     In 2006, the State of California passed legislation initiating two programs to control/reduce the creation of greenhouse gases. The two laws are more commonly known as AB 32 (the Global Warming Solutions Act) and SB 1368. In 2016, California enacted SB 32, which expanded the requirements of AB 32. Under AB 32 and SB 32, the California Air Resources Board (the “CARB”) is required to adopt a greenhouse gas emissions cap on all major sources (not limited to the electric sector) to achieve goals of reaching (i) 1990 greenhouse gas emissions levels by the year 2020, (ii) 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and (iii) 80% below 1990 emissions levels by 2050. Under the CARB regulations that took effect on January 1, 2013, electricity generators and certain other facilities are now subject to an allowance for greenhouse gas emissions, with allowances allocated by both formulas set by the CARB and auctions.
     SB 1368 added the requirement that the California Energy Commission, in consultation with the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) and the CARB, establish greenhouse gas emission performance standards and implement regulations for PPAs with a term of five or more years entered into prospectively by publicly owned electric utilities. The legislation directs the California Energy Commission to establish the performance standard as one not exceeding the rate of greenhouse gas emitted per megawatt hour (“MWh”) associated with combined-cycle, gas turbine baseload generation.
     United States – Federal
     Over the past several years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has taken a number of actions respecting CO2 emissions. The EPA’s actions include its December 2009 finding of “endangerment” to public health and welfare from greenhouse gases, its issuance in September 2009 of the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule which required large sources, including power plants, to monitor and report greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA annually beginning in 2011, and its issuance in May 2010 of its final Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, which under a phased-in approach requires large industrial 

 
  14

 
facilities, including power plants, to obtain permits to emit, and to use best available control technology to curb emissions of, greenhouse gases. In addition, in August 2015, the EPA issued its final rule regulating carbon emissions from existing electric generating units, which is referred to as the Clean Power Plan (the “CPP”).  As a result of judicial challenge, however, the CPP has not been implemented, and more recently the Trump Administration has pursued efforts to revoke it. In October 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rule to repeal the CPP for existing power plants; in August 2018, the EPA issued its proposed Affordable Clean Energy Rule, which would establish emissions guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants; and in December 2018, the EPA issued a proposed rule to considerably ease the greenhouse gas standards for new power plants. Any such rulemaking activities could take years to complete, and are likely to draw legal challenges. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of the current legal challenges to the CPP or any legal challenges to future administrative actions.
     Canada - Federal
     In Canada, the federal government has implemented greenhouse gas reporting regulations and are developing additional programs to address greenhouse gas emissions. Under the 2004 federal Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Program (“GHGRP”), all facilities which emit 50,000 tonnes or more of carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2eq”) per year are required to submit reports on their emissions to Environment Canada.
     On October 3, 2016, the Government of Canada announced its proposed pan-Canadian approach for the pricing of carbon pollution. On January 15, 2018, the Government of Canada released the draft Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, setting out the mechanics to be used to backstop the federal government’s pan-Canadian approach to carbon pricing in provinces that have not implemented, by January 1, 2019, a carbon pricing system that the federal government has determined complies with its carbon pricing requirements. It also included a proposed design of rules to enhance market liquidity.  In May 2018, the federal Government published “Carbon pricing: compliance options under the federal output-based pricing system,” a document that describes the proposed rules, and on June 21, 2018 the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act went into effect.  Since that time the federal government has published, on October 31, 2018, SOR/2018-212, 213 and 214 (the “GHGPPA SOR”), to amend Schedule 1 to the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, to establish criteria respecting facilities and persons, and to issue the greenhouse gas emissions information production order.
 Alberta, British Columbia and Québec already have compliant carbon pricing systems in place and are not expected to be subject to the federal backstop regime. Although at the beginning of 2017, Ontario had implemented a compliant cap and trade system, there was a change in the provincial government as a result of the election held in June 2018. The newly elected Ontario government cancelled the cap and trade regulation and prohibited all trading of emission allowances, effective as of July 3, 2018, and on October 31, 2018 formally repealed the cap-and- trade legislation. As a result, our Ontario operations are now subject to the federal backstop regime. Under the federal GHGPPA SOR, large industrial emitters, such as our operations in Tunis and Nipigon, are subject to the federal output-based pricing system (“OBPS”)` provided for in Part 2 of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act. The federal backstop regime imposes a minimum Cdn$20/tonne of CO2e (“tCO2e”) carbon price beginning on January 1, 2019, increasing by Cdn$10 increments each following year to 2022. 
     The validity of the federal backstop regime is being challenged on constitutional grounds by Ontario and Saskatchewan, and Ontario also is working on its own output-based performance standards for large emitters (which appear likely to be similar to and potentially compatible with the federal OBPS). The details of both the federal OBPS and the Ontario output-based performance standards had not been settled at the beginning of 2019, notwithstanding that they are to be effective from and after January 1, 2019. The federal government issued a “Notice of intent to make regulations under part 2 of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act” on December 20, 2018, and subsequently, on January 9, 2019, issued “The Complete Text for Proposal for the Output-Based Pricing System Regulations” for public comment (which are due by February 15, 2019). The implications of the federal OBPS for our operations in Tunis and Nipigon is discussed below (in the section on Canada – Ontario).
     Canada – British Columbia
     The Government of British Columbia has enacted a number of significant pieces of climate action legislation 

 
  15

 
that frame British Columbia’s approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions with the goal of supporting its participation in the emerging low-carbon economy.
     One key piece of legislation is the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets Act, which was re-enacted in November 2018 as the Climate Change Accountability Act (British Columbia) (“CCAA”), which sets legislated targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in British Columbia. Using 2007 as a base year, CCAA (along with related Ministerial Orders) requires that emissions must be reduced by a minimum of 40% by 2030, 60% by 2040 and 80% by 2050. Also required in connection with CCAA are (from 2020 onward) British Columbia Greenhouse Gas Inventory Reports (reports are prepared in even-numbered years and tables are updated in odd-numbered years), Community Energy and Emissions Inventory Reports (prepared every two years) and Carbon Neutral Action Reports (prepared annually), all of which are designed to provide scientific, comparable and consistent reporting of greenhouse gas sources.
     Other related, key pieces of legislation include the Carbon Tax Act (“CTA”) and the Greenhouse Gas Industrial Reporting and Control Act (“GGIRCA”). CTA operates to put a price on greenhouse gas emissions, providing an incentive for sustainable choices and practices by producers of greenhouse gases. GGIRCA came into force on January 1, 2016 and combined several pieces of British Columbia's existing greenhouse gas legislation into a single legislative framework. It includes the ability to set a greenhouse gas emissions intensity benchmark for regulated industries and enables the benchmark to be met through flexible options, such as purchasing offsets or paying a set price per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions that would be dedicated to a technology fund. Three regulations necessary to implement GGIRCA also came into force on January 1, 2016: the Greenhouse Gas Emission Reporting Regulation (“GGERR”), the Greenhouse Gas Emission Administrative Penalties and Appeals Regulation (“GGEAPAR”) and the Greenhouse Gas Emission Control Regulation (“GGECR”). GGERR establishes compliance reporting requirements and ensures that industrial operations that emit more than 10,000 carbon dioxide equivalent tonnes per year report their greenhouse gas pollution each year. GGEAPAR establishes the process for when, how much, and under what conditions administrative penalties may be levied for non-compliance with GGIRCA or the regulations made under GGIRCA. GGECR establishes the BC Carbon Registry and sets criteria for developing emission offsets issued by the provincial government. GGECR also establishes the price for funded units issued under GGIRCA that would go towards a technology fund. Regulated operations will purchase offsets from the market or funded units from government to meet emission limits. Funded unit revenue that goes to a technology fund will also support the development of clean technologies with significant potential to reduce British Columbia's emissions over the long term.
    
Canada - Ontario
     In a news release issued on June 15, 2018, Ontario Premier-designate Doug Ford announced that the first act of his newly formed government would be to cancel Ontario’s cap and trade program (under the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016).  Effective as of July 3, 2018, the Ontario government cancelled the cap and trade regulation and prohibited all trading of emissions allowances, and on October 31, 2018 formally repealed the Ontario cap-and-trade legislation. Bill 4: Cap and Trade Cancellation Act, 2018 (the legislation which repealed the former cap-and-trade regime) retired or cancelled outstanding emissions allowances and strictly limited the ability of those holding emissions allowances to bring claims seeking to recover for any damages suffered as a result.
     Under the previous cap-and-trade regime, facilities in Ontario with annual greenhouse gas emissions of 25,000 tonnes or more were generally required by law to participate in the regime by obtaining emissions allowances. However, facilities which primarily generate electricity using natural gas from a local distributor were excluded from the requirement to obtain emission allowances and instead participated in the program through the payment of the carbon price charged by the local natural gas distributor on the natural gas delivered after the end of 2016. As a result, our operations in Ontario were not holding emissions allowances when the Ontario cap and trade program was cancelled and were not adversely affected by the cancellation of that regime.
     As a result of the cancellation of the Ontario cap-and-trade regime, from January 1, 2019 our operations in Nipigon and Tunis are subject to the federal OBPS and potentially also to the Ontario output-based performance standard (both of which remain to be fully detailed).  Under the federal “Notice Establishing Criteria Respecting 

 
  16

 
Facilities and Persons and Publishing Measures: SOR/2018-213,” any facility which emitted more than 50kt of CO2e during any of the 2014, 2015, 2016 or 2017 calendar years, and which carries out, as its primary activity, the generation of electricity using fossil fuels, is a covered facility and subject to the OBPS. Since the Nipigon and Tunis projects are each generating electricity using natural gas and each reported emissions in excess of 50kt of CO2e for one of the 2014, 2015, 2016 or 2017 calendar years (119,248 tonnes for 2014 in the case of Tunis and 115,725 tonnes for 2016 in the case of Nipigon), each is considered a covered facility and subject to the federal OBPS. 
     Assuming that the federal OBPS regulations remain as set out in the January 9, 2019 proposal (discussed in the section on Canada - Federal), the Tunis and Nipigon projects will be required to either pay an excess emissions charge or remit compliance units as prescribed by the federal backstop regime for each tonne of CO2e emissions in excess of 370 tonnes of CO2e / GWh of electricity generated by such operations and will receive free emissions allowances if the emissions fall below that measure.  The details of arrangements for the possible recovery of these potential additional costs from the IESO will depend on the terms of the applicable PPA.
     Renewable Energy
     More than half of the U.S. states and most Canadian provinces have set mandates requiring the achievement of certain levels of renewable energy production and/or energy efficiency during target timeframes. This includes generation from wind, solar and biomass, and/or renewable fuel mandates. For example, in 2011, California enacted a law requiring retail sellers of electricity to deliver 33% of their customers' electricity requirements from renewable resources, as defined in the statute, by 2020. In 2015, California enacted SB 350, which increases the amount of electricity from renewable resources that California retail sellers must deliver after 2020 to 40% of retail sales by December 2024, 45% of retail sales by December 2027, and 50% of retail sales by December 2030. In order to meet CO2 reduction goals, changes in the generation fuel mix are forecasted to include a reduction in existing coal resources, higher reliance on natural gas and renewable energy resources and an increase in demand-side resources. Investments in new or upgraded transmission lines will be required to move increasing renewable generation from more remote locations to load centers.
     In December 2015, 195 countries participating in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCC”), at its 21st Conference of the Parties meeting (“COP21”) held in Paris, adopted a new global agreement on the reduction of climate change (the “Paris Agreement”). The Paris Agreement became effective in November 2016, after it had been ratified by a sufficient number of countries. The Paris Agreement sets a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, to be achieved by aiming to reach a global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible. The Paris Agreement consists of two elements: a legally binding commitment by each participating country to set an emissions reduction target, referred to as “nationally determined contributions” or “NDCs,” with a review of the NDCs that could lead to updates and enhancements every five years (Article 4) and a transparency commitment requiring participating countries to disclose in full their progress (Article 13). As decided at the 24th Conference of the Parties meeting in December 2020, countries are expected to submit updated NDCs in 2020. Accordingly, the Paris Agreement may result in additional regulations to reduce carbon emissions in coming years.
     Canada ratified the Paris Agreement, and submitted an NDC that included a 2030 target of 30% below 2005 levels. The United States also submitted an NDC, which called for reducing its net greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. However, the Trump Administration has announced the planned withdrawal of the U.S.  from the Paris Agreement. In light of the legislative, judicial and executive factors influencing regulatory action, significant uncertainty exists as to how greenhouse gas restrictions in the U.S. will impact our facilities in the future.
     EMPLOYEES
     As of February 27, 2019, we had 230 employees, 166 in the United States and 64 in Canada. Of our Canadian employees, 44 are covered by collective bargaining agreements, which will expire on December 19, 2020 and December 31, 2020. During 2018, we did not experience any labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of our facilities.
