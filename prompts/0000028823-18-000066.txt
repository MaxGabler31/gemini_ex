COMPETITION
The Company competes with global, regional and local competitors to provide Connected Commerce solutions to financial institutions and retailers. Changing customer demands require the Company's customers to transform their business processes by investing in innovative technology. The Company differentiates its offerings by providing a wide range of innovative solutions.
Based upon outside independent industry surveys from Retail Banking Research (RBR), the Company believes that it is a leading service provider and manufacturer of self-service solutions across the globe. The Company maintains a global service infrastructure that allows it to meet delivery deadlines. Many of the Company’s customers are beginning to adopt branch automation solutions which improve the customer experience and enhance efficiency. The complexity of new hardware, software and service solutions is resulting in longer sales and deployment cycles for large projects. As the trend towards branch and store automation continues, the traditional lines of “behind the counter” and “in front of the counter” solutions are eroding, which creates additional opportunity for the Company while increasing the number of competitors. The Company differentiates its offerings by leveraging innovations in advanced security, biometric authentication, mobile connectivity to support contactless transactions, advanced sensors, cloud computing and the Internet of Things to facilitate real-time monitoring activities, and miniaturization technologies. With regard to Microsoft’s plan to end support for Windows 7 in 2020, Diebold Nixdorf became the first ATM provider to ship Windows 10 ready products.
Competitors in the self-service banking market include NCR, Nautilus Hyosung, GRG Banking Equipment, Glory Global Solutions, Oki Data and Triton Systems, as well as a number of localized manufacturing and service providers such as Fujitsu and Hitachi-Omron in Asia Pacific (AP); Hantle/GenMega in North America (NA); KEBA in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and Perto in Latin America (LA). In a number of markets, the Company sells to but also competes with independent ATM deployers such as Cardtronics, Payment Alliance International and Euronet. 
In Brazil, the Company provides election systems, lottery terminals and product support to the Brazil government. Competition in this market segment is based upon technology pre-qualification demonstrations.
In the retail market, the Company is a market leader in helping retailers to transform their stores to a consumer-centric approach by providing electronic POS (ePOS), automated checkout solutions, cash management, a software suite and services for the majority of retailers headquartered in Europe. The Company, competes with the key players highlighted above plus other technology firms such as Toshiba and Fujitsu and specialized software players such a GK Software, Oracle, Aptos and PCMS. Many retailers also work with proprietary software solutions.
For its services offerings, the Company perceives competition to be fragmented, especially in the product related services segment. While other manufacturers provide basic levels of product support, the competition also includes local and regional third-party providers. With respect to higher value managed services, the Company competes with large IT service providers such as IBM, Atos, Fiserv and DXC Technology. 
In the self-service software market, the Company, in addition to the key hardware players highlighted above, competes with several smaller, niche software companies like KAL, or with the internal software development teams of banks and retailers.

OPERATIONS
The Company’s operating results and the amount and timing of revenue are affected by numerous factors, including production schedules, customer priorities, sales volume and sales mix. During the past several years, the Company has honed its offerings to become a total solutions provider with a focus on Connected Commerce. As a result of the emphasis on services and software, the nature of the Company's workforce is changing and new skill sets are required such as:

The Company carries working capital mainly related to trade receivables and inventories. Inventories generally are only manufactured or purchased as orders are received from customers. The Company’s normal and customary payment terms generally range from 30 to 90 days from date of invoice. The Company generally does not offer extended payment terms. The Company

Historically, the Company has not experienced significant cancellations within its product backlog. Additionally, over 50 percent of the Company's revenues are derived from its service business, for which backlog information is not measured.
