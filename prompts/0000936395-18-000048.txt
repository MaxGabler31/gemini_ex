Industry Background 
Network Traffic Growth and Increased Capacity Requirements
The markets in which we sell our communications networking solutions have seen significant changes in recent years. In particular, optical networks – which carry video, data and voice traffic by encoding digital information on multiple wavelengths of light traveling across fiber optic cables – have experienced strong traffic growth for several years. This growth, and the resulting requirements for increased network capacity and transmission speed, is being driven by an increasingly diverse set of communications services and applications. These services and applications, including those set forth below, are increasing the bandwidth and service demands placed upon networks and are challenging the business models of many network operators.

• | Cloud-Based Services. Enterprises and consumers continue to replace locally-housed computing and storage by adopting a broad array of innovative cloud-based models – including Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) – and an expanding range of cloud-based services that host key applications, store data, enable the viewing and downloading of content and utilize on-demand computing resources.


• | Over-the-Top (OTT) Services and Video Streaming. OTT content refers to video, multimedia and other applications provided directly from the content source to the viewer or end user across a third-party network. Traffic from streaming and OTT services, including high definition and ultra-high definition video, has expanded with the increased availability of, and end-user demand for, video content accessible through a variety of devices and media.


• | On-Demand Services. Users of communications services require an on-demand service level that allows them to be connected wherever and whenever they desire. Businesses rely upon enterprise services and data center connectivity that facilitate global operations, employee mobility and access to critical business applications and data. Consumers expect broadband services, including peer-to-peer internet applications, augmented reality applications and multimedia streaming and downloads, to be available on-demand.


• | Mobile Devices and Applications. Traffic from mobile applications, including video, internet and data services, has expanded with the proliferation of smartphones, tablets and other wireless devices. Because so much of wireless traffic ultimately travels across a wireline network to reach its destination, growth in mobile communications continues to place demands upon wireline networks, including backhaul and fronthaul networks emanating from cell sites.

In addition, emerging services and applications present further challenges and are likely to place significant service, capacity and automation demands upon network infrastructures. These include:

• | Network Densification. Increasing demand by businesses and consumers for data, content and related services are impacting network infrastructures, particularly at the edge of networks, where increased computing power and automation are required to meet the quality of experience required by these users. To cost-effectively address these demands, network operators will be required to adopt emerging wireless and wireline network architectures. Fifth-Generation wireless broadband technology (5G) is designed to enable significant increases in data consumption by a growing number of users and devices, thereby better supporting the “Internet of Things” and other emerging applications. “Fiber deep” initiatives by cable and multiservice operators are designed to push digital fiber-based communications closer to the end-user, increasing potential bandwidth to homes and enterprises and increasing data speeds while addressing power, space and operating costs. Implementation of these network densification initiatives is expected to have a significant effect on wireline networks. 


• | Internet of Things. As the number of networked connections between devices and servers grows, machine-to-machine-related traffic (M2M) is expected to represent an increasing portion of traffic as the Internet of Things evolves. These connections can provide value-added services and allow sharing of data that can be monitored and analyzed. We expect network traffic relating to the interconnection of devices to grow along with the widening adoption of internet and cloud-based content delivery, smart grid applications, health care and safety monitoring, resource and inventory management, home entertainment, consumer appliances, connected transportation and other M2M data applications.

5


• | Ultra-High Definition TV and Virtual and Augmented Reality. Ultra-high definition TV and the advent of immersive technologies like 360° video, virtual reality and augmented reality are likely to place meaningful capacity and capability demands on networks as adoption of these technologies grows. The television, internet and consumer electronics industries are rapidly advancing these technologies and making them more widely available and affordable to consumers.

We believe that increased adoption of these services and applications will further increase traffic and capacity requirements and place additional service challenges on network infrastructures. 
Network Transition to Programmable Networks with Enhanced Automation
To reduce costs and promote network efficiency and simplicity, network operators, particularly communications service providers, are increasingly looking to adopt next-generation infrastructures that are more open, programmable and automated. Networks today are still primarily physical in nature and are generally managed via inventory management, planning and fulfillment systems. Moving toward digital network transformation, operators are increasingly leveraging information technology (IT) strategies that emphasize software capabilities and automation through policy controlled and analytics-driven network solutions that are more predictive and can adapt more quickly to changing end-user demands. To bridge the existing gap between the operational realities of today and the hybrid networks and operations of the future – emphasizing virtual elements, automation and analytics – we expect expect network operators to adopt strategies that may include one or more of the following:

• | Orchestration. Software-based orchestration simplifies the end-to-end creation, automation and deployment of services across multiple physical and virtual network domains. We believe software-based orchestration presents an opportunity to reduce network and operational complexity and offers an alternative to certain elements of traditional operations support and business support systems, which network operators have historically relied upon to support network management functions such as inventory, service provisioning, network configuration and fault management.


• | Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Through NFV, network operators can separate network services or capabilities from the physical network assets that traditionally provide these services or capabilities to end users. To reduce their dependence upon single-purpose hardware platforms and accelerate the time to market for new revenue-generating services, network operators are increasingly looking for solutions that enable network functions through software that runs on industry-standard servers, network and storage platforms.


• | Software-Defined Networking (SDN). SDN seeks to simplify networks to create more open environments that ease management, support automation and quickly deliver customized services to end users, by enabling individual network elements to be directly programmable by standards-based software control. This results in end-to-end visibility of network flows, enabling the optimization of traffic paths and the control of data flows through a network.

We believe that adoption of these strategies will require network operators and their network solutions vendors to increasingly look to utilize an ecosystem of physical and virtual network resources. We expect that these network architectural approaches, in turn, will drive increased openness and interoperability of multi-vendor, multi-domain network environments, requiring an increased degree of cooperation, collaboration and interoperability among solutions providers.
Different Approaches to Design and Procure Network Infrastructure Solutions
Leading network operators are pursuing a diverse range of approaches, or “consumption models,” to manage the design and procurement of their network infrastructures. These consumption models include: the traditional systems procurement of fully integrated solutions including hardware, software and services from the same vendor; the procurement of a fully integrated hardware solution from one vendor with the separate use of a network operator’s own or another vendor’s SDN-based control; the procurement of an integrated photonic line system with open interfaces from one vendor and the separate or “disaggregated” procurement of modem technology from a different vendor; or the use of published reference designs and open source specifications for the procurement of off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware (often referred to as “white box” hardware) to be used with open source software. Further, a number of network operators, and certain of our suppliers, are pursuing the development and future deployment of smaller form factor, pluggable modem technology as an alternative to integrated platforms. In parallel, network operators are also exploring a range of alternatives to meet their software requirements, from licensing integrated and proprietary third party software solutions to fully utilizing open source software.
6

Many of these consumption models being pursued continue to be in their early stages of evaluation, and the models that ultimately emerge and their level of adoption will depend in significant part on the circumstances and strategies of certain network operators. We also believe that broader adoption of procurement models involving greater disaggregation remains uncertain, particularly for those network operators for whom such an approach would result in increased operational complexity, expense, and integration and support obligations. Based on our views of the market and customer interactions, we expect that the largest portion of deployed capacity, for at least the next few years, will continue to be through the purchase of fully integrated hardware solutions. We expect that customer consideration of a variety of consumption models will require network operators and vendors alike to assess, and possibly broaden, their offerings and commercial models over time, thereby placing premium on a vendor’s ability to provide robust network solutions with the maximum amount of flexibility and choice.
Industry Consolidation 
Our industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years among our competitors, customers and suppliers alike. To drive scale and market share gains and meet the intense investment capacity required to keep pace with technology innovation, acquisition activity among vendors of networking solutions has increased. Among our customers, there have been significant horizontal and vertical consolidation activities by service providers and cable operators, with several such operators acquiring media and content companies. Customer consolidation can increase purchasing power and has in the past resulted in delays or reductions in network spending due to changes in strategy or leadership, the timing of regulatory approvals and debt burdens associated with such transactions. Finally, significant consolidation among component suppliers may reduce the number of independent suppliers and could disrupt our supply chain and adversely impact pricing. Consolidation activity across our industry can create opportunities and challenges for our business. We expect this trend to continue and it may have a significant impact on the entire industry, including the competitive landscape, the range sales opportunities for vendors and their supply chains. 
Strategy 
Our strategy is to leverage our technology leadership, diversify and expand our addressable markets, and drive the profitable growth of our business. Key initiatives of this strategy include:
Extend Innovation Leadership and Enable Customers to Realize an Adaptive Network. We are focused on pushing the pace of innovation in our markets and providing market-leading offerings that promote what we refer to as the Adaptive Network. Our Adaptive Network vision emphasizes programmable network infrastructure that leverages our WaveLogic coherent modem technology, enhanced IP capabilities in access and aggregation networks, and software control and automation capabilities. We are focused on providing market-leading programmable infrastructure innovation capable of providing advanced network telemetry and allowing for tuning of network capacity and speeds to meet changing needs. We are also introducing solutions with enhanced IP capabilities to help network operators make better operating decisions and to optimize their network performance and deliver a better user experience. We continue to invest in our automation solutions and believe that through automation, analytics and intent-based policies, we can enable an Adaptive Network that can rapidly scale, self-configure and self-optimize by assessing network pressures and demands.
Leverage Blue Planet for Intelligent, Closed-Loop Automated Networks. We seek to promote adoption of our Blue Planet Automation Software, highlighting its ability to transform network operations and management as well as IT and back office processes. Blue Planet is designed to automate, orchestrate and manage both physical and virtual network resources and their associated services across data centers and the wide area network (WAN). We believe that Blue Planet can transform legacy networks into “service ready” networks, accelerating the creation, delivery and lifecycle management of new, cloud-based services. We seek to enable closed-loop automation for networks by leveraging automation and orchestration, multi-domain inventory, topology and federation, analytics, machine learning and assurance. Through our acquisitions of Packet Design, LLC and DonRiver Holdings, LLC in fiscal 2018, we augmented our software offerings to include route optimization and assurance functionality and multi-domain inventory topology and visualization. We are also investing in professional services delivery to enable the sale of broader solutions that combine software and services. This solutions-based selling approach seeks to use insights into our customers’ common operational and networking issues and positions Blue Planet software and services to enable the digital network transformation that our customers are seeking. 
Promote Flexibility and Choice. Choice is an increasingly important element of our customers’ networking approach and their efforts to manage network demands and costs. Our philosophy is rooted in enabling choice in the market by developing network solutions that address a range of different customer consumption models. Our desire to promote choice influences our development priorities as well as our go-to-market approach. We intend to offer a range of choice to customers across packet-optical convergence, coherent modem leadership and multi-vendor, multi-domain network automation software. We are pursuing “merchant modem” sales opportunities that leverage our Wavelogic modem leadership, directly and indirectly. 
7

Merchant modems, often called transponders, are the combination of an optical chipset or ASIC with other key optical components that are sold independently of integrated systems. Merchant modem vendors often sell their modem technology in the form of an optical module or pluggable to a variety of market participants, including other original equipment manufacturers. While broader adoption of procurement models that emphasize disaggregation of hardware and software remains uncertain, we expect that a range of different consumption models will require us to broaden our existing offering and commercial models over time. We intend to offer solutions and pursue sales opportunities across a range of customer consumption models to drive the evolution of next-generation network infrastructures and to promote choice in our markets.
Focus Diversification on High-Growth Applications and Customer Segments. We believe that continued diversification of our business is important to address the dynamic industry environment in which we operate, to continue to grow our business, and to better withstand potential slowdowns adversely affecting particular geographies, markets or customer segments. Our strategy is to diversify our solutions offerings and customer base to address fast-growing applications and customer segments. We seek to increase adoption of our packet access and aggregation solutions and to secure and grow market share with our Blue Planet Automation Software platform. We are also pursuing opportunities with a diverse set of network operators in growth segments and geographies. Our go-to-market strategy seeks to capture additional market share with current customers and other Web-scale providers and emerging network operators, and to displace competitors in international markets, particularly in Asia-Pacific and India. We intend to use our direct and indirect sales channels to expand our sales with several other market verticals, including cable and multiservice operators, submarine network operators, enterprise customers and government and research and education (R&E) customers.

Leveraging our WaveLogic coherent modem technology, we are taking steps to pursue merchant modem sales opportunities through our Optical Microsystems products. To date, we have not generated meaningful revenue through these activities; however, such sales will be reflected within the Converged Packet Optical product line of our Networking Platforms segment.
Packet Networking. Our Packet Networking products allow customers to simplify their network designs while delivering new, revenue-generating services. These products target applications primarily from the access to metro networks, where they aggregate and switch packet-based traffic to support such applications as Ethernet business services, mobile backhaul services, fiber deep, as well as ongoing network infrastructure scaling. Our Packet Networking products facilitate network cost effectiveness, including reduced costs associated with power and space, as compared to more complex, traditional IP routing network designs. 
To date, revenue from our Packet Networking segment has been primarily related to our 3900 family of Service Delivery Switches and our 5000 family of Service Aggregation Switches and Platforms. These products support the access and aggregation tiers of telecommunications networks and have principally been deployed to support business services and wireless backhaul applications. Our 3900 family of Service Delivery Switches are purpose-built to fit small, medium and large customer sites as well as multi-tenant office and residential buildings. Our 5100 family of Service Aggregation Switches and Platforms provide aggregation to fill higher capacity links within both the metro access and aggregation tiers of networks, minimizing the number of router assets required in the core. The recent introduction of our 3900 family of Service Virtualization Platforms allows for customers to migrate towards software-based networking and services based on Network Function Virtualization. 
Our Packet Networking portfolio also includes our 8700 Packetwave Platform, a multi-terabit packet switching platform for high-density metro networks and inter-data center wide area networks.

Software and Software-Related Services
Our Software and Software-Related Services segment consists of our Blue Planet Automation Software and Services and our Platform Software and Services. 
Blue Planet Automation Software and Services. Our Blue Planet Automation Software is a comprehensive, micro-services based open software suite that allows service providers to use enhanced knowledge about their networks to drive adaptive optimization of their services and operations. Blue Planet facilitates the evolution toward more efficient, modernized network operations with software-defined programmability that accelerates the delivery of on-demand services, reduces costs and enables a path toward a more predictive, autonomous network. We believe our Blue Planet solutions can enable network operators to minimize vendor-specific management silos, reduce network complexity and improve end-to-end service visibility and control. A number of applications can be deployed on the core platform, either individually or in any combination, and include: 

• | Multi-Domain Service Orchestration (MDSO). Network infrastructures are comprised of multiple technology layers and domains — such as the data center, cloud, metro, access and core networks — and it is often complex for network operators to offer services end-to-end in this environment. Blue Planet enables service orchestration across multiple network (physical and virtual) domains and multiple hardware and software vendors. By using open APIs and intent-based, model-driven templates, Blue Planet simplifies end-to-end services lifecycle management and increases service velocity by abstracting the complexity of underlying domains.


• | Inventory (BPI). By integrating or “federating” data from multiple existing inventory and assurance systems and presenting it in a single dynamic view, network operators can gain real-time visibility into the topology and state of network and service resources from end to end. Integrating with legacy inventory systems, BPI helps network providers simplify and optimize key operational processes such as service fulfillment, network planning and service assurance. When integrated with other Blue Planet applications, BPI can leverage SDN and NFV to enable even greater levels of automation, deliver more dynamic services and respond more quickly to customers’ rapidly changing requirements. 


• | Route Optimization and Assurance (BP ROA). Optimizing the delivery of IP services across the cloud, BP ROA combines routing, traffic and performance analytics for real-time, path-aware operational monitoring. These capabilities enable forensics for troubleshooting transient network problems that can cause service disruptions. Interactive modeling helps engineers predict the impact of network infrastructure and service changes, simulate new workloads for capacity planning and test failure scenarios to build more resilient networks.


• | NFV Orchestration (NFVO). Blue Planet provides network operators with carrier-grade, NFV management and orchestration capabilities for instantiating and managing virtualized network functions and data center resources. NFVO uses an open, vendor-agnostic approach that allows network operators to select and scale those virtual network functions (VNFs) they wish to offer to their end customers.


• | Analytics. Blue Planet Analytics incorporates big data analytics and machine-learning to generate network insights, thereby helping operators make smarter, data-driven business decisions. Analytics collects, processes and stores data from multiple sources across the network and leverages machine learning innovations for analysis and insights. Analytics enables the visualization and identification of network trends to create profitable services, better predict capacity requirements and anticipate potential network and service disruptions before they happen. We also offer a related Network Health Predictor application that provides preemptive network maintenance across the optical, Ethernet and IP layers of the network.


• | Blue Planet Services. To complement our software portfolio, we offer a range of related services that include professional services for solution customization, software and solution support services, consulting and design, build-operate-transfer services and technical support relating to our software offerings. These services are focused on enhancing network automation and network analytics, enabling multi-vendor integration and support, and implementing programmable multi-domain next-generation networks.

The market relating to these software automation capabilities is in the early stages and, as such, revenue from our Blue Planet Automation Software platform has not been significant to date.
10


Platform Software and Services. Our software offerings also include our Platform Software, which provides analytics, data and planning tools to assist customers in managing our Networking Platforms products in their networks. Our Platform Software includes:

• | Manage, Control and Plan (MCP). MCP software provides SDN-based domain control of our next-generation packet and optical networks, unifying Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security (FCAPS) management of our multi-layer network infrastructure, with service management and online network planning. Built on Blue Planet’s open, extensible microservices-based architecture, MCP marks a shift from legacy, fragmented network management software, to programmable, cloud-native operations that integrate into network operators’ business processes.

Lifecycle operations – including equipment commissioning, service provisioning, assurance and performance monitoring – are greatly automated and simplified through MCP. Providing granular resource management and control, MCP allows network operators to plan to meet customer service needs. 

• | OneControl Unified Management System. OneControl is an integrated network and service management solution that supports much of our Networking Platform product lines from a single software platform. OneControl offers end-to-end service creation, activation and assurance to enable rapid deployment of next-generation wavelength, OTN and packet services. It also provides visualization of fault and performance information for network health status and enables management functions, including network inventory, network element configuration backup, network element software delivery and security administration.


• | Platform Software Services. To complement our Platform Software portfolio, we offer a range of related services that include software subscription services, consulting, network migration and integration, installation and upgrade support services, and technical support relating to our Platform Software offerings. These services are focused on enabling our customers to operate their Ciena networks most efficiently, and to modernize their operations through migration to our MCP domain control solution.

Our Platform Software offering also includes planning tools and a number of legacy software solutions that support our installed base of network solutions. As we gain further customer adoption of our MCP software platform and we transition features, functionality and customers to this platform, we expect revenue to decline for our legacy Platform Software solutions.

Our operations personnel manage our relationships with our third-party manufacturers and global supply chain, addressing component sourcing, manufacturing, product testing and quality, and fulfillment and logistics relating to the distribution and support of our products.
We utilize a sourcing strategy that emphasizes global procurement of materials and product manufacturing in lower cost regions. We rely upon third-party contract manufacturers, with facilities in Canada, Mexico, Thailand and the United States, to manufacture, support and ship our products, and therefore are exposed to risks associated with their businesses, financial condition and the geographies in which they operate. We also rely upon these contract manufacturers and other third parties to perform design and prototype development, component procurement, full production, final assembly, testing and distribution operations. Our manufacturers procure components necessary for assembly and manufacture of our products based on our specifications, approved vendor lists, bills of materials and testing and quality standards. Our manufacturers’ activity is based on rolling forecasts that we provide to them to estimate demand for our products. We work closely with our manufacturers and suppliers to manage material, quality, cost and delivery times, and we continually evaluate their services to ensure performance on a reliable and cost-effective basis.
We currently use distribution partners to fulfill and deliver our products. We believe that our sourcing, manufacturing and distribution strategies allow us to conserve capital, lower costs of product sales, adjust quickly to changes in market demand and operate without dedicating significant resources to manufacturing-related plant and equipment.
As part of our effort to optimize our operations, we continue to focus on driving cost reductions through sourcing, rationalizing our contract manufacturers and supply chain, outsourcing or virtualizing certain activities, and consolidating distribution sites and service logistics partners. These efforts also include process optimization initiatives, such as vendor-managed inventory, and other operational models and strategies designed to drive improved efficiencies in our sourcing, production, logistics and fulfillment.
Backlog
Generally, we make sales pursuant to purchase orders placed by customers under framework agreements that govern the general commercial terms and conditions of the sale of our products and services. These agreements do not obligate customers to purchase any minimum or guaranteed order quantities. Moreover, we are periodically awarded business for new network opportunities or network upgrades following a selection process. In calculating backlog, we only include (i) customer purchase orders for products that have not been shipped and for services that have not yet been performed; and (ii) customer orders relating to products that have been delivered and services that have been performed, but are awaiting customer acceptance under the applicable contract terms. Generally, our customers may cancel or change their orders with limited advance notice, or they may decide not to accept our products and services, although instances of both cancellation and non-acceptance are rare. Backlog may be fulfilled several quarters following receipt of a purchase order, or in the case of certain service obligations, may relate to multi-year support period. As a result, backlog should not necessarily be viewed as an accurate indicator of future revenue for any particular period.
Our backlog was $1.26 billion as of October 31, 2018 as compared to $1.13 billion as of October 31, 2017. Backlog includes product and service orders from commercial and government customers combined. Backlog at October 31, 2018 includes approximately $226.8 million, primarily related to orders for products and maintenance and support services that are not expected to be filled or performed within fiscal 2019. Because backlog can be defined in different ways by different companies, our presentation of backlog may not be comparable with figures presented by other companies in our industry.
Seasonality
Like other companies in our industry, we experience quarterly fluctuations in customer activity due to seasonal considerations. We typically experience reductions in order volume toward the end of the calendar year, as the procurement cycles of some of our customers slow and network deployment activity by service providers is curtailed. This period coincides with the first quarter of our fiscal year. This seasonality in our order flows has often resulted in weaker revenue results in the first quarter of our fiscal year. These seasonal effects may not apply consistently in future periods and may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue or results of operations.

Competition 
Competition among networking solution vendors remains intense on a global basis. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, frequent introduction of new networking solutions and aggressive selling efforts, including using significant pricing pressure to displace incumbent vendors and capture market share. Competition for sales of communications networking solutions is dominated by a small number of very large, multi-national companies. Our competitors include Huawei, Nokia, Cisco, Juniper Networks and ZTE. As compared to us, many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, operational and marketing resources, significantly broader product offerings and more established relationships with service providers and other customer segments. Because of their scale and resources, they may be perceived to be a better fit for the procurement or network strategies of larger network operators. We also continue to compete with several smaller but established companies that offer one or more products that compete directly or indirectly with our offerings or whose products address specific niches within the markets and customer segments we address. These competitors include Infinera, ADVA and ECI. We also compete with a number of smaller companies that provide significant competition for a specific product, application, customer segment or geographic market. 
Keeping pace with the market’s demands for technology innovation requires considerable research and development investment capacity. As a result, some of our competitors, both large and small, have chosen to rely upon coherent modem technology developed by and procured from third-party “merchant” providers, including Acacia Communications, NTT Electronics (NEL) and Inphi. We may compete with these providers, either indirectly as a result of their technology being a key enabling technology for our competitors, or directly across emerging consumption models as we pursue our strategy of capturing market share within merchant modem sales opportunities. 
The principal competitive factors applicable to our markets include: 

• | the ability to meet business needs and drive successful outcomes;


• | functionality, speed, capacity, scalability and performance of network solutions;


• | price for performance, cost per bit and total cost of ownership of network solutions;


• | incumbency and strength of existing business relationships;


• | ability to offer comprehensive networking solutions, consisting of hardware, software and services;


• | time-to-market in delivering products and features;


• | technology roadmap and forward innovation capacity;


• | company stability and financial health;


• | flexibility and openness of platforms, including ease of integration, interoperability and integrated management;


• | ability to offer solutions that accommodate a range of different consumption models;


• | space requirements and power consumption of network solutions;


• | software and network automation capabilities;


• | manufacturing and lead-time capability; and


• | services and support capabilities.

As a result of the intense environment in which we compete, winning new opportunities can often require that we agree to unfavorable commercial terms or pricing and other onerous contractual commitments. These terms can adversely affect our results of operations. These terms can also lengthen our revenue recognition or cash collection cycles, add start-up costs to initial sales or deployment of our solutions, require financial commitments or performance bonds and place a disproportionate allocation of risk upon us.
We expect the competition in our industry to continue to broaden and to intensify as network operators pursue a diverse range of network strategies. As these changes occur, we expect that our business will overlap more directly with additional networking solution suppliers, including IP router vendors, data center switch providers and other suppliers or integrators of networking technology traditionally geared toward different network applications, layers or functions. In addition, as we seek increased customer adoption of our Blue Planet Automation Software, and network operator demands for software programmability, management and automation increase, we expect to compete more directly with software vendors and information technology vendors or system integrators. We may also face competition from system and component vendors, including those in our supply chain, who develop pluggable modem technology or other networking products based on off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware technology, referred to as “white box” hardware, particularly where a customer’s network strategy seeks to emphasize deployment of such product offerings or to adopt a disaggregated approach to the procurement of hardware and software.  

Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property Rights
14

The success of our business and technology leadership is significantly dependent upon our proprietary and internally developed technology. We rely upon the intellectual property protections afforded by patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to establish, maintain and enforce rights in our proprietary technologies and product branding. We maintain an incentive program for inventions and patents that seeks to reward innovation and an internal invention review board that selects appropriate protection mechanisms for our technology. We regularly file applications for patents and have a significant number of patents in the United States and other countries where we do business. As of December 1, 2018, we had 1,620 issued U.S. patents, 244 pending U.S. patent applications, 315 issued non-U.S. patents and 154 pending non-U.S. patent applications.
We also rely on non-disclosure agreements and other contracts and policies regarding confidentiality with employees, contractors and customers to establish proprietary rights and to protect trade secrets and confidential information. Our practice is to require employees and relevant consultants to execute non-disclosure and proprietary rights agreements upon commencement of their employment or consulting arrangements with us. These agreements acknowledge our ownership of intellectual property developed by the individual during the course of his or her work with us. The agreements also require that these persons maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary information disclosed to them.
Enforcing proprietary rights, especially patents, can be costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps that we are taking will detect or prevent all unauthorized use. The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We have been subject to several claims related to patent infringement, including by competitors and also by non-practicing patent assertion entities, and we have been requested to indemnify customers pursuant to contractual indemnity obligations relating to infringement claims made by third parties. Intellectual property infringement assertions could cause us to incur substantial costs, including settlement costs and legal fees in the defense of related actions. If we are not successful in defending these claims, our business could be adversely affected. For example, we may be required to enter into a license agreement requiring us to make ongoing royalty payments; we may be required to redesign our products; or we may be prohibited from selling infringing technology in certain jurisdictions.
Our operating system software, Platform Software, Blue Planet Automation Software and other solutions incorporate software and components under licenses from third parties, including software subject to various open source software licenses. As network operators seek to adopt network infrastructures with increased software control and programmability and to utilize an open ecosystem of physical and virtual network resources provided by multiple third parties, we expect to incorporate into our solutions additional elements of open source software or license additional software or technology from third parties. We expect that these network architectural approaches will require increased openness and interoperability of multi-vendor, multi-domain network environments, requiring an increased degree of cooperation among solutions providers. Failure to obtain or maintain such licenses or other third-party intellectual property rights could affect our development efforts and market opportunities, or could require us to re-engineer our products or to obtain alternate technologies. Moreover, there is a risk that open source and other technology licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products.
Environmental Matters
Our business and operations are subject to environmental laws in various jurisdictions around the world, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) regulations adopted by the European Union. We are also subject to disclosure and related requirements that apply to the presence of “conflict minerals” in our products or supply chain. We seek to operate our business in compliance with such laws relating to the materials and content of our products and product takeback and recycling. Environmental regulation is increasing, particularly outside of the United States, and we expect that our domestic and international operations may be subject to additional environmental compliance requirements, which could expose us to additional costs. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to environmental regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Employees
As of October 31, 2018, we had a global workforce consisting of 6,013 employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider the relationships with our employees to be good. While we have been able to recruit and retain key personnel with the capabilities required by our business and markets, competition for highly skilled technical, engineering and other personnel with experience in our industry is intense. We believe that our future success depends in critical part on our continued ability to recruit, motivate and retain such qualified personnel.
