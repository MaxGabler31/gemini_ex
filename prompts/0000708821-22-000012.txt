We have developed and nurtured long-term relationships with several of the largest brands in the Restaurant/Retail segment, three of which represent a signification portion of our total revenues. We have been an approved provider of restaurant technology systems and related support services to McDonald’s Corporation and their franchisees since 1980 and an approved supplier to Yum! Brands, Inc. since 1983.
Competition
Our software and hardware product offerings face competition in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving restaurant and retail markets. Most of our larger customers have several approved suppliers of software and/or hardware similar to one or more of our products. We compete in these markets directly with product offerings from Oracle Corporation, NCR Corporation and others. We compete on the basis of product delivery (cloud versus traditional on-premise software applications), existing and planned product design, features and functionality, software application and integration capabilities, quality and reliability, product development capabilities, price, and customer service. Our competitive advantages include: our unified commerce cloud platform, open solutions offerings, cloud delivery model based on modern architecture, enterprise grade solutions, purpose-built hardware, advanced development capabilities, extensive domain knowledge and expertise, excellent product reliability, a customer-dedicated direct sales force organization, and responsive customer service and support. As relevant technologies evolve and customer demands and expectations increase, so do the competitive pressures in the market, with new companies entering and existing companies expanding their product and service portfolios. We expect competition in the restaurant and retail markets to continue to increase, including competition from both cloud and traditional on-premise POS software, customer loyalty and engagement software, back-office software, hardware providers and other business software and solution providers. With many of our product and service offerings, we face competition from companies who have access to significantly more financial and technical resources than we possess. 
Research and Development
Continuous product research, innovation, and product development are an integral part of our business. We continuously evaluate customer needs and new technologies to enable us to develop innovative and relevant products, in addition to creating enhancements to our unified commerce cloud platform and existing products that improve and/or add to their functionality, performance, operation, and integration capabilities–from leveraging the latest innovations in cloud computing to wireless headsets and other devices to advances in internet performance. Research and development expenses were $34.6 million, $19.3 million, and $13.4 million, in 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. 
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We assemble our ES 8000 series platforms internally in the U.S. We source other hardware products and related materials, product assemblies, and components from third parties. We purchase most of the materials, 
product sub-assemblies and full assemblies from several suppliers, we do, however, rely on sole sources for certain of our assembly components and hardware products. We periodically review and evaluate potential risks of disruption to our supply chain operations in the event one or more of our suppliers should fail to perform. See “Risk Factors” for a discussion on risks related to our supply chain operations.

Additionally, we design, integrate, and operate antenna data collection solutions for experimentation, demonstration, and test support. We also provide technical engineering and analysis services to intelligence community customers, supporting development and deployment of advanced prototypes and quick reaction systems, including applications for high performance computing platforms (e.g., Cray exascale computers).
Mission Systems
PAR Government’s mission systems (“MS”) group provides a wide range of technical and operational services to sustain mission critical components of the Department of Defense Information Network (the “DoDIN”). These services include continuous satellite and teleport facility operations and maintenance, engineering and installation services including inside and outside plant services, and maintenance of infrastructure and information systems for very low frequency, low frequency, high frequency, very high frequency and ground-based radio transmitter/receiver facilities, including high tower antennas up to 1200 feet. We operate and maintain satellite communications and teleport facilities with ultra-high frequency, super high frequency and extremely high frequency satellite communication earth terminals, and support telecommunications architectures such as fixed submarine 
broadcast systems and high-frequency global communications systems. The DoD communications earth stations operated by PAR Government's MS group are the primary communications systems utilized by the national command authority and military services to exercise command and control of the nation’s air, land, and naval forces and to provide support to allied coalition forces.
PAR Government’s MS group supports globally-deployed operational forces by providing reliable 24/7/365 support services for a variety of satellite communication systems. We provide satellite control center operations and mission planning for DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, or C4ISR, operations. We provide satellite ground system support, including operations and maintenance, sustainment, upgrades, communications security management, anomaly response/resolution, process improvement, emergency response and disaster recovery. Our experience also includes mission planning and operations training.
PAR Government’s MS group provides comprehensive, dependable, and secure information systems support services to the DoD and other federal agencies. These services include information technology infrastructure library based, tier 0 to 3 service desk operations for thousands of users, network system administration, database administration, information assurance/system security, information security training, and government network management. We also perform maintenance, monitoring, upgrades, planning, testing, and integration and configuration services, to include security systems including intrusion detection systems.
The PAR Government MS group supports critical information systems which operate elements of the DoDIN to support the National Command Authority (President and Joint Chiefs of Staff), DoD, and other federal agencies. Our system troubleshooting and regulatory experts support the customer mission around the globe. Approximately 60% of our footprint is outside the continental U.S. with contracts in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia, and U.S. commonwealths and territories in the Pacific and Caribbean.
PAR Government’s MS group has strong and enduring relationships with a diverse set of customers throughout the DoD, intelligence community, and other federal agencies. Our track record of delivering mission critical services to government customers spans decades, and includes contracts continuing 20 years or more, with an average contract duration of three to five years. We work closely with our customers, with many of our mission system employees co-located at customer sites. Our strong relationships and on-site presence with our customers enables PAR Government to develop substantive customer and technical domain knowledge, translate mission understanding into exemplary program execution, and create continued demand for PAR Government’s services.
Products Division
PAR Government’s software product business draws on decades of research and development (“R&D”), image processing and geospatial information systems, or GIS, experience. Licensable products focus on serving analysts and operators who seek highly accurate and timely information with both temporal and geospatial context. Product utility spans the modern battlefield from rear echelon analyst cell to the field operations center to the mobile devices and displays carried by infantryman at the very forward edge of a battlespace. Currently we offer two types of software products. The geospatial visualization, or GV, image processing suite is used by the international defense and intelligence community to analyze still and video imagery. A second product line, “Sit(X)®”, provides situational awareness solutions used by government and private organizations to manage rapid response teams or deployed field units. Customers include global geospatial software providers, NATO partners, public safety organizations, and the U.S. senior intelligence agencies.
Marketing and Competition
The PAR Government segment obtains contracts through a mix of competitive proposals and technical paper submissions in response to solicitations from government organizations and prime contractors. In addition, we often obtain contracts by submitting unsolicited proposals against publicly identified government requirements which are selected on merit for further development and funding. Although well positioned in our business areas, competition for government contracts is intense. Many of our competitors are large corporations that have substantially greater financial resources and broader capabilities in management technology. Within our ISR portfolio we compete based on the technical talent and accomplishments of our development staff, software support and program management teams who have earned a reputation for rapid solutioning, leading edge software solutions and technical talent with high security clearance and the background and appetite to tackle truly difficult problems. In our MS contract portfolio, we also compete with many smaller, economically disadvantaged 
companies, many of which are designated by the government for preferential, set aside, treatment that target segments of the government contract market. Here the principal competitive factors are past performance, the ability to perform the statement of work, price, technological capabilities, management capabilities, and service. Many of our DoD customers are migrating to price sensitive, best value procurements while leveraging commercial software standards, applications, and solutions.
Our strategy is to build upon PAR Government segment's sustained performance on existing service contracts, coupled with investments in enhanced business development capabilities. We believe we are well positioned to realize continued renewals of expiring contracts and extensions of existing contracts, and to secure service and solution contracts in expanded areas within the DoD and other federal agencies. We believe our highly relevant technical competencies, intellectual property, and investments in new technologies provide opportunities to offer systems integration, products, and highly-specialized service solutions to the DoD, intelligence community, and other federal agencies. The general uncertainty in U.S. defense total workforce policies (military, civilian, and contract), procurement cycles, and spending levels for the next several years are factors we monitor as we develop and implement our business strategy for our Government segment.
Backlog
The value of existing PAR Government contracts at December 31, 2021, net of amounts relating to work performed to that date, was approximately $195.3 million, of which $38.6 million was funded and includes $5.8 million related to the IDIQ Contract. The value of existing PAR Government contracts at December 31, 2020, net of amounts relating to work performed to that date, was approximately $150.5 million, of which $27.8 million was funded. Funded amounts represent those amounts committed under contract by government agencies and prime contractors. Of the December 31, 2021 PAR Government contract backlog of $195.3 million, approximately $87.0 million is expected to be completed in calendar year 2022.
Intellectual Property and Other Rights
A number of the Company's products and components are developed and designed based on our existing copyrighted work and/or patents issued or obtained through the acquisition of other businesses. Our other products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. We establish, maintain, and protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary information through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents, and registered and common law trademarks, that protect our brand associations and symbolize our goodwill, as well as copyrights that relate to software and various distinctive characteristics of our products. We also rely on a combination of confidentiality and assignment-of-invention agreements with our employees and consultants, and enter into confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers and other third parties with whom we have strategic relationships. We believe our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets have value, and we believe our use and reliance on the intellectual property laws of the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as our agreements and licenses, protect and maintain our rights in our intellectual property and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts unauthorized third parties may attempt to use, copy, or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property and/or our other proprietary information; moreover, the rapidly changing technology in the Restaurant/Retail segment and the Government segment makes our future success dependent on the development skills, innovative designs, and technological expertise of our employees and consultants, as well as strategic technology acquisitions, rather than on the protection afforded by patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws.
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including with respect to data protection and privacy, import and export controls, trade restrictions, anti-corruption and bribery, and employee and labor relations. Please see our disclosure in “Risk Factors” for more details regarding laws and regulations governing our business.
Human Capital 
We prioritize finding, developing and rewarding extraordinary talent. Our employee-first strategy is a priority designed to provide a diverse, inclusive and safe environment where our 1,477 full-time employees and 64 part-time employees across the Company enjoy coming to work each day to support our customers and grow our business.
We value speed, ownership, focus and winning together, which we consider to be the foundation for how we operate and make decisions.
Leadership's Role: Our senior management team is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. We seek employees who share a passion for technology and its ability to improve our customers’ businesses. Our mission is to create an environment that reflects our values of speed, ownership, focus and winning together where our employees thrive. Our strategy is to hire the best talent, give them the responsibility and authority they deserve, and let them make the decisions on how to best execute. We design our employee compensation and benefits programs to be competitive, reinforce our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”), and consistent with our values, to incentivize and reward outstanding performance. Our chief executive officer and chief human resources officer regularly update the compensation committee of our board of directors on key areas of our human capital strategy, including the following:
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: Our commitment to DEI is simple: it’s about community, belonging and fairness. Like our customers who bring people together through providing delicious and accessible food, we bring our employees together by providing a work environment that understands and integrates our employees' unique perspectives and voices. This is essential for cultivating a diverse, inclusive and equitable environment for all, and we are committed to scale our DEI efforts to reflect the communities where our employees live and our customers operate. Through evolving our culture, talent and corporate deliverables we aim to set an example that shows the impact of fostering a diverse and equitable environment and how that drives genuine employee experiences and innovation.
We made significant investments in our DEI program in 2021 including appointing a DEI Lead, increasing employee resource group programming such as speaker series events for our Women in Technology enterprise resource group, and investing in our policies including expanded parental leave and offering infertility benefits. Our 2022 strategy includes continued investments in DEI through data management and collection, corporate goal setting as well as increased education and inclusion initiatives such as DEI training/workshops and creating a more diverse employee pipeline. Our goal is to have an infrastructure where our diverse employee population thrives.
Our U.S. employee population consists of 27% ethnically diverse employees and 25% are women. Globally, our workforce consists of 26% women. 20% of our U.S. employee population is under the age of 30, with 50% between the ages of 30 and 50 and 30% over the age of 50. Globally, 24% of our employees are under the age of 30, with 50% between the ages of 30 and 50 and 26% over the age of 50.
Employee Engagement and Talent Management/Development: Consistent with our employee-first strategy, we believe that our employees should have the opportunity to have a forum to communicate their feedback, concerns and suggestions. We conduct quarterly employee net promoter surveys and monthly engagement surveys. Understanding the “pulse” of our employees through engagement surveys is critical to inform our actions with respect to integrating areas of opportunity in our employee engagement, retention and total rewards programs. 
To support our meritocratic, pay-for-performance strategy, we execute annual performance reviews and bi-annual 360 performance reviews with the intent to incentivize and motivate our employees. Talent assessments enable us to identify individuals that are ready for promotion and areas of development across our core competencies. In 2021, we invested in building our talent management systems. Our 2022 plans include a first quarter launch of a robust talent development platform to dramatically increase our investment in the core competency development for all of our employees.
Health and Safety: The health and safety of our employees in the workplace is of utmost importance to us. We regularly assess our facilities to ensure compliance with our health and safety guidelines and regulatory requirements. The importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy has been underscored by the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (“COVID-19” or “pandemic” or “COVID-19 pandemic” ). Our operating policies are consistent with the guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect our employees and their families and we actively reassess evolving policies and COVID-19 trends which inform our policies and safe practices, including work-at-home policies, PPE requirements, limitation on visitors and our business-essential travel only policy.
Talent Acquisition and Attrition: We are aggressively managing headwinds created by the “Great Resignation” or “Big Quit” that are being experienced throughout the U.S. economy. Our objective of retaining talent is rooted in our employee-first strategy and includes investments in employee engagement and experience, DEI, 
talent management systems and talent development, which has contributed to our increased speed and volume of hiring to support our growth plans. We continue to make appropriate adjustments to ensure competitive compensation to attract and retain talent. We also implemented several benefit enhancements, including unlimited paid time off, adoption and infertility benefits, expanded parental leave and healthcare plan improvements. Our overall attrition rate in 2021 was 14%, and our attrition rate for who we consider top talent was 3.9%.
