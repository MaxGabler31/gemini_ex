Item 1. Business
General
Xenia Hotels & Resorts, Inc. is a Maryland corporation that primarily invests in uniquely positioned luxury and upper upscale hotels and resorts with a focus on the Top 25 lodging markets as well as key leisure destinations in the United States ("U.S.").
Substantially all of the Company's assets are held by, and all the operations are conducted through XHR LP (the "Operating Partnership"). XHR GP, Inc. is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and is wholly-owned by the Company. As of December 31, 2021, the Company collectively owned 97.9% of the common limited partnership units issued by the Operating Partnership ("Operating Partnership Units"). The remaining 2.1% of the Operating Partnership Units are owned by the other limited partners comprised of certain of our current executive officers and members of our Board of Directors and includes vested and unvested long-term incentive plan ("LTIP") partnership units. LTIP partnership units may or may not vest based on the passage of time and meeting certain market-based performance objectives.
Xenia operates as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT, the Company cannot operate or manage its hotels. Therefore, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries lease the hotel properties to XHR Holding, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively with its subsidiaries, "XHR Holding"), the Company's taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"), which engages third-party eligible independent contractors to manage the hotels. The third-party hotel operators manage each hotel pursuant to a management agreement, the terms of which are discussed in more detail under "Part I-Item 2. Properties - Our Principal Agreements."
The Company's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership, and XHR Holding and each of their wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company's subsidiaries generally consist of limited liability companies ("LLCs"), limited partnerships ("LPs") and our TRS. The effects of all inter-company transactions are eliminated. 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company owned 34 lodging properties with a total of 9,659 rooms.
The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 200 S. Orange Avenue, Suite 2700, Orlando, Florida, 32801, and our telephone number is (407) 246-8100. The Company’s website is www.xeniareit.com. The information contained on our website, or that can be accessed through our website, neither constitutes part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K nor is incorporated by reference herein.
The following chart shows our structure as of December 31, 2021: 
(1)Ownership percentages include vested and unvested LTIP partnership units which may or may not vest based on the passage of time and meeting certain market-based performance objectives.
Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
The onset and global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic led federal, state and local governments in the United States to impose measures intended to control its spread, including restrictions on freedom of movement and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, school closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and social distancing requirements, and also to implement phased, multi-step policies of re-opening regions of the country. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hotel industry have been significant and unprecedented with global demand for lodging drastically reduced and occupancy levels reaching historic lows in 2020 and continuing into 2021. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of our hotels and resorts temporarily suspended operations for certain periods of time during 2020. All of our lodging properties had resumed operations by the end of May 2021.
Leisure demand gradually improved during the second half of 2020, a trend that accelerated during the first seven months of 2021. We also began to see increasing levels of demand for both business transient and group business during the second quarter and into July 2021. In August and September 2021, however, we began to experience a softening in demand due to the impact of the Delta variant and a seasonal decline in leisure demand. Occupancy rebounded in October and November 2021 before declining again in December 2021 as COVID-19 case counts, positivity ratios and hospitalizations began to increase in many parts of the U.S. Additionally, many companies delayed their office re-openings and return to work timelines and, during the fourth quarter, we began to experience group business cancellations for meetings held in early 2022. We have estimated the impact of these cancellations, net of cancellation and attrition revenue and events that have been rebooked, to be approximately $5.0 million. There remains significant uncertainty regarding the pace of recovery and whether and when business travel and larger group meetings will return to pre-pandemic levels. We may be impacted by, among other things, the distribution and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines and boosters, breakthrough cases, and new variants of COVID-19, as well as the ongoing local and national response to the virus including indoor mask mandates, group size limitations and other restrictions. As the recovery continues, we expect that the pace will vary from market to market and may be uneven in nature. 
Business Objectives and Growth Strategies
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing recovery, it was necessary during 2021 to continue to focus primarily on our balance sheet flexibility and liquidity and on the safe and efficient operation of our properties. 
In May 2021, we issued $500 million of 4.875% Senior Notes due in 2029 and used the net proceeds to repay in full the borrowings under our revolving credit facility, prepay in full our corporate credit facility term loan maturing in August 2023 and repay the mortgage loan collateralized by Kimpton Hotel Palomar Philadelphia. As of December 31, 2021, we do not have any debt maturities until 2024.
We also worked with our lenders to complete amendments to our revolving credit facility and our one remaining corporate credit facility term loan. These amendments have provided flexibility as we move through the pandemic toward eventual recovery, however, as further described in this Annual Report, they also resulted in certain restrictions during the covenant waiver period.
We continued to be prudent with the use of our cash liquidity through capital expenditures below our historical averages prior to the onset of COVID-19 and continued suspension of our dividend through 2021.
Looking Forward
Over the long-term, we intend to turn our focus back to our primary objective and growth strategy of allocating capital in a high-quality diversified portfolio of uniquely positioned luxury and upper upscale hotels and resorts with a focus on the Top 25 lodging markets as well as key leisure destinations in the U.S. We invest at valuation levels that we believe will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. We pursue this objective through the following investment and growth strategies:
•Follow a Differentiated Investment Strategy Across Targeted Markets. We use our management team’s network of relationships in the lodging industry, real estate brokers and our relationships with multiple hotel brands and management companies, among others, to source acquisition opportunities. When evaluating opportunities, we use a multi-pronged approach to investing that we believe provides us the flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities in a variety of markets across any point in the economic cycle. We consider the following characteristics when making investment decisions: 
-    Market Characteristics. We seek opportunities across a range of urban and dense suburban areas, primarily in the Top 25 lodging markets as well as key leisure destinations in the U.S. We believe this strategy provides us with a broader range of opportunities and allows us to target markets and sub-markets with particular positive characteristics, such as multiple demand generators, favorable supply and demand dynamics and attractive long-term projected RevPAR growth. We believe assets in the Top 25 lodging markets and key 
leisure destinations in the U.S. present attractive investment opportunities considering the favorable supply and demand dynamics, RevPAR growth trends, attractive valuations and better opportunities for diversification. 
-    Asset Characteristics. We generally pursue uniquely positioned hotels in the luxury and upper upscale segments that are affiliated with leading brands as we believe these segments yield attractive risk-adjusted returns. Within these segments, we seek hotels that will provide guests with a distinctive lodging experience, often tailored to reflect local market environments, which draws demand from both business and leisure transient and group business segments. We seek properties with desirable locations within their markets, exceptional facilities, and other competitive advantages that are hard to replicate. We also favor properties that can be purchased below estimated replacement cost. We believe our focus on uniquely positioned luxury and upper upscale hotel assets allows us to seek appropriate investments that are well-suited for specific markets. 
-    Operational and Structural Characteristics. We pursue both new or recently constructed assets that require limited capital investment, as well as more mature and complex properties with opportunities for our dedicated asset and project management teams to create value through more active operational oversight and targeted capital expenditures.
•Drive Growth Through Aggressive Asset Management, In-House Project Management and Strategic Capital Investment. We believe that investing in our properties and employing a proactive asset management approach designed to identify investment strategies will optimize internal growth opportunities. Our management team’s extensive industry experience across multiple brands and management companies coupled with our integrated asset management and project management teams enable us to identify and implement value-add strategies and to prudently invest capital in our assets to optimize operating results while leveraging best practices across our portfolio.
-    Aggressive Asset Management. Our experienced asset management team focuses on driving property performance through revenue enhancement and cost containment efforts. Our ability to work with a wide variety of management and franchise companies provides us with the opportunity to benchmark performance across our portfolio in order to share best practices. While we do not operate our hotel properties directly, and under the terms of our management agreements our ability to participate in operating decisions regarding our hotels is limited, we conduct regular revenue, sales, and financial performance reviews and also perform in-depth on-site and virtual reviews focused on ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives. We interact frequently with our management companies and on-site management personnel, including conducting regular meetings with key executives of our management companies and brands. We work to maximize the value of our assets through all aspects of the hotel operation and ancillary real estate opportunities. 
-    In-House Project Management. By maintaining a dedicated in-house capital planning and project management team, we believe we are able to develop our capital plans and execute each renovation project at a lower cost and in a timelier manner than if we outsourced these services. In addition, our project management team has extensive experience in the development and renovation of hotel properties, providing both in-depth knowledge of building construction, as well as the opportunity for us to evaluate potential development opportunities. We view this as a significant competitive strength relative to many of our peers. 
-    Strategic Capital Investment to Enhance Portfolio Performance. As part of our ongoing asset management activities, we continuously review opportunities to reinvest in our hotels to maintain quality, increase long-term value and generate attractive returns on invested capital. We may also opportunistically dispose of hotels to take advantage of market conditions or in situations where the hotels no longer fit within our strategic objectives. We believe our breadth of experience and integrated in-house asset management and project management teams are instrumental in our ability to acquire and operate assets and to capitalize on redevelopment opportunities.
Our Financing and Capital Strategy 
In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took preemptive actions to preserve our liquidity and manage our cash flow, such as reducing non-essential spending, revisiting our near term investment strategies, including strategic dispositions, reducing corporate employee payroll costs, restructuring and/or repaying our debt agreements, and the issuance of $500 million of 6.375% Senior Notes due in 2025 (the "2020 Senior Notes") and $500 million of 4.875% Senior Notes due in 2029 (the "2021 Senior Notes" and, together with the 2020 Senior Notes, "the Senior Notes"). The Company also suspended its quarterly dividend after payment of the first quarter dividend in April 2020. We believe these actions have positioned us well to manage our operations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and its recovery. We believe our strong 
balance sheet will also help position us to manage through this downturn and to capitalize on investment opportunities that arise. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of $554.2 million of cash on hand, including $36.9 million of restricted cash primarily set aside to maintain our hotels. Our weighted-average debt maturity as of December 31, 2021 was 3.7 years for our mortgage loans, 5.2 years for our corporate credit facility term loan, the Senior Notes, and revolving credit facility and 4.8 years for all debt. Our total debt had a weighted-average interest rate of 5.18%.
We strive to maintain a flexible capital structure that puts us in a position to be opportunistic in allocating capital for investment. We seek to maintain a modest amount of leverage and closely monitor our near term debt maturities. Over time, we intend to finance our long-term growth with issuances of common and preferred equity securities, as well as with debt financings utilizing staggered maturities. Our debt includes a revolving credit facility, a corporate credit facility term loan, the Senior Notes, mortgage loans collateralized by our hotel properties, or leasehold interests under the ground leases on our hotel properties, and may include other types of private and public debt in the future. 
From time to time, we may also seek to create value for our stockholders by opportunistically repurchasing shares of our common stock at valuations we believe are attractive. We have been authorized to repurchase up to $175 million of the Company's outstanding common stock (the "Repurchase Program"). The Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date. This Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time, and does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of shares. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $94.7 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization. The terms of our amended corporate credit facilities currently prohibit us from making repurchases of our common stock until we achieve compliance with applicable debt covenants and our covenant waiver period ends.
We may also issue new equity or debt and use the proceeds from such issuances to acquire assets, make capital improvements that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns on investment, or for general corporate purposes. We have an "at-the-market" program (the "ATM program") available for selling common stock with an aggregate gross offering price of up to $200 million. From time to time we may sell shares under the ATM program to raise capital when we believe conditions are advantageous. The ATM program was upsized in May 2021 and had $200 million available for sale as of December 31, 2021. We may issue equity under this program or other equity issuance programs if we determine that shares can be sold at an attractive price and there is a compelling use for such proceeds. We may have restrictions on the use of proceeds raised from equity capital during our covenant waiver period.
Subject to loan restrictions during our covenant waiver period and the indentures governing the Senior Notes, we anticipate using a portion of cash flows generated from operations to fund future acquisitions as well as for property redevelopments, return on investment initiatives, working capital requirements, lease payments and, at times, payment of dividends and share repurchase programs. Subject to market conditions, we intend to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and/or other debt from time to time with proceeds from periodic common and preferred equity issuances, long-term debt financings, sale of assets and cash flows from operations. 
Competition
The U.S. lodging industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other hotels and alternative accommodation options for guests (e.g. those that are found on websites that facilitate short-term rentals of homes and apartments from owners) in each of their markets on the basis of several factors, including, among others, room rates, quality of accommodations, service levels and amenities, location, brand affiliation, reputation and reservation systems. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our hotels are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels and alternative accommodation options. We believe that hotels, such as our portfolio of hotels, which are predominately affiliated with leading brands, will enjoy the competitive advantages associated with operating under such brands, which includes strong health, safety and cleanliness protocols, and are important to our customers. Increased competition could harm our occupancy, RevPAR, ADR and consequently our revenue and may require us to provide additional amenities, or make capital improvements that we otherwise would not have to make, and may materially and adversely affect our operating results and liquidity. 
We face competition for the acquisition of hotels from other REITs, private equity firms, institutional investors, hedge funds, specialty finance companies, insurance companies, governmental bodies, foreign investors and other entities. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and operational resources and access to capital than we have and may have greater knowledge of the markets in which we seek to invest. This competition may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us and decrease the attractiveness of the terms on which we may acquire our targeted hotel investments, including the cost thereof. In addition, these competitors seek financing through the same channels that we do. Therefore, we compete for funding in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease or grow at a rate that is less than the underlying demand.
Seasonality
The lodging industry is seasonal in nature, which can be expected to cause fluctuations in our rooms revenues, occupancy levels, room rates, operating expenses and cash flows. The periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property and depend upon location, type of property, and competitive mix within the specific location. In a stable macroeconomic environment, we expect our revenues and operating income to be highest in the second quarter of the year followed by the first, third and fourth quarters. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and is expected to continue to disrupt, our historical seasonal patterns while the pandemic is ongoing and during the recovery.
Cyclicality
The lodging industry is cyclical and generally its growth or contraction follows the overall economy, as has been the case during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a history of increases and decreases in demand for and supply of hotel rooms, in occupancy levels and in rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles. Variability of results through some of the cycles in the past has been more severe due to changes in the supply of hotel rooms in given markets or in given segments of hotels. The combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can cause significant volatility in results for owners of hotel properties. From time to time cyclicality may be disrupted by significant events as was the case during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which continued to impact the lodging industry in 2021. The costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable. Because of this, in an environment of declining revenues the rate of decline in earnings will be higher than the rate of decline in revenues. Conversely, in an environment of increasing demand and room rates, the rate of increase in earnings is typically higher than the rate of increase in revenues.
Regulations 
General 
Our hotels are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of our hotels has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business.
Americans with Disabilities Act
Our hotels must comply with applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"), to the extent that such hotels are "public accommodations" as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our hotels where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our hotels are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, non-compliance with the ADA could result in substantial capital expenditures, imposition of fines and/or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one and we will continue to assess our hotels and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Environmental Matters 
Under various laws relating to the protection of the environment, a current or previous owner or operator (including tenants) of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property and may be required to investigate and clean up such contamination at that property or emanating from that property. These costs could be substantial and liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our hotels may expose us to third-party liability and materially and adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to incur debt using the real estate as collateral.
Our hotels are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, storage tanks, air emissions from emergency generators, storm water and wastewater discharges, lead-based paint, mold and mildew and waste management. Our hotels incur costs to comply with these laws and regulations and could be subject to fines and penalties for noncompliance.
Some of our hotels contain asbestos-containing building materials. We believe that the asbestos is appropriately contained in accordance with current environmental regulations and that we have no need for any immediate remediation or current plans to remove the asbestos. Environmental laws require that owners or operators of buildings with asbestos-containing building materials properly manage and maintain these materials, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to 
comply with these requirements. In addition, third-parties may seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials.
Some of our hotels may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other adverse conditions, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation. The presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our hotels could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected hotel or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from guests or employees at our hotels and others if property damage or health concerns arise.
Our Tax Status
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("the Code") for U.S. federal income tax purposes, beginning with our short taxable year that commenced on January 5, 2015 and ended on February 3, 2015. We believe that we have been organized and have operated, and will continue to operate, in a manner that will allow us to maintain our REIT status for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with such short taxable year and we intend to continue operating in such a manner. To qualify for REIT status, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains.
We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, in which our hotels are indirectly owned by our Operating Partnership, through subsidiary limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other legal entities. We own and control 100% of the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership and own, directly or indirectly, approximately 97.9% of the Operating Partnership Units in our Operating Partnership, with the remaining 2.1% owned by certain of our current executive officers and members of our Board of Directors. In the future, we may issue additional common or preferred units in our Operating Partnership, from time to time, in connection with acquisitions of hotels, financings, compensation or other reasons.
In order for the income from our hotel operations to constitute "rents from real property" for purposes of the gross income tests required for REIT qualification, we cannot directly or indirectly operate any of our hotels. Accordingly, we lease each of our hotels, and intend to lease any hotels we acquire in the future, to our TRS lessees. As required for our qualification as a REIT, our TRS lessees have engaged third-party hotel management companies that are eligible independent contractors to manage our hotels on market terms. Our TRS lessees pay rent to us that we intend to treat as "rents from real property". Our TRS, which owns our TRS lessees, is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes applicable to corporations and we are generally subject to sales tax on a portion of the rent paid from our TRS lessees.
Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer of Our Stock 
Our charter authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to enable us to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Furthermore, our charter prohibits any one person or a group (as defined in our charter) from actually or constructively owning more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt (prospectively or retroactively) a person or group (as defined in our charter) from the ownership limits if certain conditions are satisfied. However, our Board of Directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limits to any proposed transferee whose ownership, direct or indirect, in excess of 9.8% of the value or number of outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock could jeopardize our status as a REIT. These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if our Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT or that compliance with such restrictions is no longer required for us to qualify as a REIT. The ownership limits may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might be in our stockholders' best interest.
Insurance
We, or our third-party management companies, carry commercial general liability, commercial property including extended coverage and business interruption, terrorism, cyber risk and umbrella liability coverage on all of our hotels and earthquake, wind, flood, hurricane and environmental coverage on hotels in areas where we believe such coverage is warranted, in each case with deductibles and limits of liability that we believe are adequate. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts we believe to be adequate to reimburse us, on a replacement basis, for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each hotel, including loss of income during the reconstruction period. We have selected policy specifications and insured limits which we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of coverage and industry practice. We do not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses, including, but not limited to, war or acts of God which are not insurable.
Human Capital
Corporate Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 34 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have implemented protocols in order to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our corporate office, including the adoption of return to work health guidelines and processes, the relocation of workstations to allow for proper social distancing and providing personal protective equipment, disinfectants and continuous protocol training and communication.
We are guided by our core values, which include civility, ethics and integrity, and a commitment to quality. These principles continuously serve as a reminder to uphold an inclusive, respectful and tolerant work culture; and to always demonstrate the highest standards of professional conduct. We do not tolerate discrimination in any form and believe equal employment opportunity is a fundamental principle. We maintain policies and programs that provide the framework for fostering and supporting a diverse and inclusive work environment which contribute to the overall corporate culture at Xenia, leading to the recruitment, retention, and growth of a qualified and successful workforce. As of December 31, 2021, our corporate workforce was comprised of approximately 38% women and 41% ethnic and racial minorities.
We believe we offer competitive compensation and benefits programs and frequently benchmark our compensation and benefits package against those in our industry and in similar disciplines. Our benefit programs include an employee stock grant program, health plan options with generous cost-sharing and health savings account contributions, dental, vision, life and disability insurance, a retirement plan with matching employer contributions, tuition reimbursements, qualified parking benefits, significant amounts of paid time off and a remote work policy. We are also committed to cultivating our employees through training and development, including leadership training, professional certifications, continuing education and professional memberships, performance management through annual performance reviews and feedback, health and wellness programs and team-building programs. We have also been recognized by the Orlando Sentinel as a Top 100 Workplace.
Hotel Employees
All persons employed in the day-to-day operations of our hotels are employees of our third-party managers. Employees at certain of our third-party managed hotels are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to review and renewal on a regular basis. Many of our third-party managers are publicly traded companies which issue their own respective annual reports with disclosures regarding their human capital policies and objectives and which provide greater detail about their employees and human capital programs and policies. 
Our History
Prior to February 3, 2015, Xenia was a wholly-owned subsidiary of InvenTrust Properties Corp. (formerly known as Inland American Real Estate Trust, Inc. or "InvenTrust"), its former parent. On February 3, 2015, Xenia was spun off from InvenTrust through a taxable pro rata distribution by InvenTrust of the outstanding common stock of Xenia to holders of record of InvenTrust's common stockholders as of the close of business on January 20, 2015 (the "Distribution"). In connection with and in order to effectuate the separation and distribution, we and InvenTrust entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement, among other agreements. These agreements provided for the allocation between us and InvenTrust of InvenTrust’s assets, liabilities and obligations (including its properties, employees and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after our separation from InvenTrust and governed certain relationships between us and InvenTrust after the separation. On February 4, 2015, Xenia’s Common Stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the ticker symbol "XHR." As a result of the Distribution, the Company became a stand-alone, publicly-traded company.
