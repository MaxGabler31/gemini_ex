Item 1.
Business
 We are a Fortune 200 corporation and a leading global provider of a comprehensive range of distribution, systems design and integration solutions for the technology industry. 
 On December 1, 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our customer experience services business (the “Separation”), which was accomplished by the distribution of one hundred percent of the outstanding common stock of Concentrix Corporation (“Concentrix”). Our stockholders received one share of Concentrix common stock for every share of our common stock held at the close of business on the record date. Concentrix is now an independent public company trading under the symbol “CNXC” on the Nasdaq Stock Market. After the Separation, we do not beneficially own any shares of Concentrix’ common stock and beginning December 1, 2020, we no longer consolidate Concentrix within our financial results or reflect the financial results of Concentrix within our continuing results of operations. We distributed a total of approximately 51.6 million shares of Concentrix common stock to our stockholders. In connection with the Separation, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement, as well as various other agreements with Concentrix that provide a framework for the relationships between the parties going forward, including among others an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement, and a commercial agreement, pursuant to which Concentrix has continued to provide services to us following the Separation. The historical results of operations and financial positions of Concentrix are reported as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements. For further information on discontinued operations, see Note 5 - Discontinued Operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
 On March 22, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) which provided that legacy SYNNEX Corporation would acquire legacy Tech Data Corporation, a Florida corporation (“Tech Data”) through a series of mergers, which would result in Tech Data becoming an indirect subsidiary of TD SYNNEX Corporation (collectively, the "Merger"). On September 1, 2021, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we acquired all the outstanding shares of common stock of Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation, the parent corporation of Tech Data, for consideration of $1.61 billion in cash ($1.11 billion in cash after giving effect to a $500 million equity contribution by Tiger Parent Holdings, L.P., Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation’s sole stockholder and an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, Inc., to Tiger Parent (AP) Corporation prior to the effective time of the Merger) and 44 million shares of common stock of SYNNEX valued at approximately $5.61 billion. 
 We previously had two reportable segments as of November 30, 2020: Technology Solutions and Concentrix. After giving effect to the Separation on December 1, 2020, we operated in a single reportable segment. After completion of the Merger, we reviewed our reportable segments as there was a change in our chief executive officer, who is also our chief operating decision maker. Our chief operating decision maker has a leadership structure aligned with the geographic locations of the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific and Japan (“APJ”) and reviews and allocates resources based on these geographic locations. As a result, as of September 1, 2021 we began operating in three reportable segments based on our geographic locations: the Americas, Europe and APJ. Segment results for all prior periods have been restated for comparability to the Company’s current reportable segments. For financial information by segment, refer to Note 13 – Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
 We distribute PC systems, mobile phones and accessories, printers, peripherals, information technology (“IT”) systems including data center server and storage solutions, system components, software, networking, communications and security equipment, consumer electronics and complementary products. We also provide systems design and integration solutions. 
 We distribute more than 200,000 technology products (as measured by active SKUs) from more than 1,500 original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), as well as suppliers of next-generation technologies and delivery models such as converged and hyper-converged infrastructure, the cloud, security, big data/analytics/Internet of things (“IoT”) and services. Our products are marketed globally to an active reseller base of more than 150,000 resellers, system integrators, and retailers. We purchase peripherals, IT systems, system components, software, networking, communications and security equipment, consumer electronics and complementary products from our suppliers and sell them to our reseller and retail customers. We perform a similar function for our distribution of licensed software products. Our reseller customers include value-added resellers (“VARs”), corporate resellers, government resellers, system integrators, direct marketers, retailers and managed service providers (“MSPs”). We provide our vendors with access to large and highly fragmented markets such as small- and medium-sized businesses (“SMB”) and serve as a variable, cost effective route to market for our vendors by providing them with access to resellers and end-users. We combine our core strengths in distribution with demand generation, supply chain management and design and integration solutions to help our customers achieve greater efficiencies in time to market, cost minimization, real-time linkages in the supply chain and aftermarket product support. We also provide comprehensive IT solutions in key vertical markets such as government and healthcare and we provide specialized service offerings that increase efficiencies in the areas of global computing components, logistics services and supply chain management. Additionally, we provide our customers with systems design and integration solutions for data center servers and networking solutions built specific to our customers’ workloads and data center environments.
 Our business is characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, and low income from operations as a percentage of revenue, or operating margin. The market for IT products is generally characterized by declining unit prices and short product life cycles. We set our sales price based on the market supply and demand characteristics for each particular product or bundle of products we distribute and services we provide.

We are highly dependent on the end-market demand for IT products, and on our partners’ strategic initiatives and business models. This end-market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new IT products and software by OEMs, replacement cycles for existing IT products, trends toward cloud computing, overall economic growth and general business activity. A difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the IT industries and increased price-based competition.
 We have been in business since 1980 and have headquarters in both Clearwater, Florida and Fremont, California. We were originally incorporated in the State of California as COMPAC Microelectronics, Inc. in November 1980, and we changed our name to SYNNEX Information Technologies, Inc. in February 1994. We later reincorporated in the State of Delaware under the name of SYNNEX Corporation in October 2003. As a result of the Merger, on October 22, 2021, we filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation to change our corporate name from SYNNEX Corporation to TD SYNNEX Corporation, effective November 3, 2021. As of November 30, 2021, we had approximately 22,000 full-time co-workers worldwide.
 Our Products and Suppliers
 We distribute a comprehensive catalog of IT products from more than 1,500 OEM suppliers, enabling us to offer comprehensive solutions to our reseller and retail customers. We group the majority of our offerings into two primary solutions portfolios, Endpoint Solutions and Advanced Solutions which are comprised of the following:
Endpoint Solutions Portfolio:
  
• | Our Endpoint Solutions portfolio primarily includes PC systems, mobile phones and accessories, printers, peripherals, supplies, endpoint technology software and consumer electronics.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced Solutions Portfolio:
  
• | Our Advanced Solutions portfolio primarily includes data center technologies such as storage, networking, servers, advanced technology software and converged and hyper-converged infrastructure. Our Advanced Solutions portfolio also includes our specialized solution businesses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our next-generation technology solutions, along with our services offerings, span our Endpoint and Advanced Solutions portfolios.
 Our suppliers include leading peripherals, IT systems, system components, software, security, networking equipment, UCC and consumer electronics manufacturers. Our primary OEM suppliers are Alphabet Inc. (Google), Apple, Inc., ASUSTeK Computer Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., HP Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company, Intel Corporation, Lenovo Group Ltd, Microsoft Corporation, and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. Our largest OEM supplier is HP Inc. Revenue from the sale of products and services provided by HP Inc. represented approximately 12%, 15% and 14% of our total revenue for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 We have distribution agreements with most of our suppliers, including HP Inc. These agreements usually provide for nonexclusive distribution rights and pertain to specific geographic territories. The agreements are also generally short-term, subject to periodic renewal, and often contain provisions permitting termination by either our supplier or us without cause upon relatively short notice. Conversely, our vendor agreements generally do not restrict us from selling similar products manufactured by competitors, nor do they require us to sell a specified quantity of product. As a result, we have the flexibility to terminate or curtail sales of one product line in favor of another due to technological change, pricing considerations, product availability, and customer demand or vendor distribution policies. An OEM supplier that elects to terminate a distribution agreement will generally repurchase its products carried in our inventory.
 Our business subjects us to the risk that the value of our inventory will be affected adversely by suppliers’ price reductions or by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of the products comprising our inventory. Many of our OEM suppliers offer us limited protection from the loss in value of our inventory due to technological change or a supplier’s price reduction. Under many of these agreements, we have a limited period of time to return or exchange products or claim price protection credits. Historically, price protection and stock rotation privileges, as well as our inventory management procedures, have helped reduce the risk of loss of inventory value. We monitor our inventory levels and attempt to time our purchases to maximize our protection under supplier programs.
 Our Customers
 We distribute IT products to more than 150,000 resellers, system integrators and retailers. Resellers are classified primarily by their end-user customers. End-users include large corporations or enterprises, federal, state and local governments, small/medium sized businesses, or SMBs, and individual consumers. In addition, resellers vary greatly in size and geographic reach. Our reseller customers buy from us and other distributors. Our larger reseller customers also buy certain products directly from OEM suppliers. System integrators offer services in addition to product resale, primarily in systems customization, integration, and deployment.

Retailers serve mostly individual end-users and to a small degree, small office/home office customers. We also provide systems design and integration solutions for data center servers built for our customers’ data center environments.
 One customer accounted for 17%, 23% and 24% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We do not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on us.
 Our Services and Solutions
 
We offer a variety of business process services to our customers. These services can be purchased individually or they can be purchased in combination with others in the form of supply chain solutions and aftermarket product support. 
 We have sophisticated pick, pack and ship operations, which allows us to efficiently receive shipments from our OEM suppliers and quickly fill orders for our reseller and retail customers. We generally stock or otherwise have access to the inventory of our OEM suppliers to satisfy the demands of our reseller and retail customers. In addition, we design and integrate energy efficient and cost-effective data center servers which are built specific to the data center environments and actual workloads of our large-scale data center customers.
 The above services are complemented by the following:
 Systems Design and Integration Solutions. We provide our customers with systems design and full rack integration solutions, build-to-order, and configure-to-order assembly capabilities. In both of these cases, we offer design, integration, test and other production value-added solutions such as thermal testing, power-draw efficiency testing, burn-in, quality and logistics support.
 Logistics Services. We provide logistics support to our reseller customers such as outsourced fulfillment, virtual distribution and direct ship to end-users. Other logistics support activities we provide include generation of customized shipping documents, multi-level serial number tracking for customized, configured products and online order and shipment tracking. We also offer full turn-key logistics solutions designed to address the needs of large volume or specialty logistics services. Our full turn-key service offering is modular in nature and is designed to cover all aspects of the logistics life cycle including, transportation management, inventory optimization, complementary product matching, reverse logistics, asset refurbishment and disposal and strategic procurement.
 Cloud Services. We provide cloud-based solutions and services to our reseller customers to enable sales of and migration to technologies in a hosted environment to small and medium businesses. Our proprietary cloud platform offers a complete package of cloud-based solutions on a user-friendly platform and allows our reseller customers and OEM vendors to own the complete customer lifecycle through direct billing, provisioning, management, and support. Our solutions cover all end-user customer needs, including, pure public cloud solutions in productivity and collaboration, IaaS, or Infrastructure as a Service, PaaS, or Platform as a Service, SaaS, or Software as a Service, Security, Mobility, IoT and other hybrid solutions. Our dedicated cloud team comprising developers, sales engineers and solutions specialists, supports our reseller customers in the sales of these solutions.
 Online Services. We maintain electronic data interchange (“EDI”), extensible markup language (“XML”), web-based communication links and mobile applications with many of our reseller and retail customers. These links improve the speed and efficiency of our transactions with our customers by enabling them to search for products, check inventory availability and prices, configure systems, place and track orders, receive invoices, review account status and process returns. We also have web-based application software that allows our customers or their end-user customers to order software and take delivery online.
 Financial Services. We offer our reseller customers various financing options, including net terms, third party leasing, floor plan financing and letters-of-credit backed financing and arrangements where we collect payments directly from the end-user. We also lease products to our reseller customers and their end-users and provide device-as-a-service to end-users. The availability and terms of our financing services are subject to our credit policies or those of third-party financing providers to our customers.
 Marketing Services. We offer our OEM suppliers a full range of marketing activities targeting resellers, system integrators and retailers including direct mail, external media advertising, reseller product training, targeted telemarketing campaigns, national and regional trade shows, trade groups, database analysis, print on demand services and web-based marketing.
Sales and Marketing
 We serve our large commercial, government reseller, and retail customers through dedicated sales professionals. We market to smaller resellers and OEMs through dedicated regional sales teams. In addition, we have dedicated product management and business development specialists that focus on the sale and promotion of products and services of selected suppliers or for specific end-market verticals. These specialists are also directly involved in establishing new relationships with leading OEMs to create demand for their products and services and with resellers for their customers’ needs. We also have a direct sales approach for our design and integration solutions business. Our sales and marketing professionals are complemented by members of our executive management team who are integral in identifying potential new customer opportunities, promoting sales growth and ensuring customer satisfaction. We have sales and marketing professionals in close geographic proximity to our reseller, retail and OEM customers.

Our Operations
 We operate 181 distribution and administrative facilities globally. Our distribution processes are highly automated to reduce errors, ensure timely order fulfillment and enhance the efficiency of our warehouse operations and back office administration. Our distribution facilities are geographically dispersed to be near reseller customers and their end-users. This decentralized, regional strategy enables us to benefit from lower shipping costs and shorter delivery lead times to our customers. Furthermore, we track several performance measurements to continuously improve the efficiency and accuracy of our distribution operations. Our regional locations also enable us to make local deliveries and provide will-call fulfillment to more customers than if our distribution operations were more centralized, resulting in better service to our customers. Our workforce is comprised of permanent and temporary employees, enabling us to respond to short-term changes in order activity.
 Our proprietary IT systems and processes enable us to automate many of our distribution operations. We use radio frequency and bar code scanning technologies in our warehouse operations to maintain real-time inventory records, facilitate frequent cycle counts and improve the accuracy of order fulfillment.
 To enhance the accuracy of our distribution order fulfillment and protect our inventory from shrinkage, our distribution systems also incorporate numerous controls. These controls include order weight checks, bar code scanning, and serial number profile verification. We also use digital video imaging to record our small package shipping activities by order. These images and other warehouse and shipping data are available online to our customer service representatives, enabling us to quickly respond to order inquiries by our customers.
 We operate our principal systems design and integration solutions facilities in the United States with additional locations in the United Kingdom and China. We generally design and integrate IT systems, data center servers and networking solutions and IT appliances, by incorporating system components purchased directly from vendors or obtained from our distribution inventory. Additionally, we perform other production value-added services, including thermal testing, power-draw efficiency testing, burn-in, quality and logistics support. Some of our design and integration solutions facilities are ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 certified.
 International Operations
 Approximately 37% of our consolidated revenue for fiscal year 2021 was generated by our international operations. As a result of the Merger, we have expanded both our domestic and international operations. Our end market strategy is to continue expanding internationally on a selective basis in order to provide our distribution capabilities to OEMs in locations that meet their regional requirements. 
 Sales and cost concentrations in foreign jurisdictions subject us to various risks, including the impact of changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the United States Dollar, which in turn can impact reported sales.
 See Note 13 – Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional financial information related to international and domestic operations.
 Seasonality
 Our operating results are affected by the seasonality of the IT products industry. We have historically experienced higher sales in our fourth fiscal quarter due to patterns in capital budgeting, federal government spending and purchasing cycles of our customers and end-users. These historical patterns may not be repeated in subsequent periods and may be impacted by the Merger.
Purchasing
 Product cost represents our single largest expense and IT product inventory is one of our largest working capital investments. Furthermore, product procurement from our OEM suppliers is a highly complex process that involves incentive programs, rebate programs, price protection, volume and early payment discounts and other arrangements. Consequently, efficient and effective purchasing operations are critical to our success.
 Our purchasing group works closely with many areas of our organization, especially our product managers who work closely with our OEM suppliers and our sales force, to understand the volume and mix of IT products that should be purchased. In addition, in certain locations the purchasing group utilizes an internally developed, proprietary information systems application that further aids in forecasting future product demand based on several factors, including historical sales levels, expected product life cycle and current and projected economic conditions. We may also rely on our receipt of good-faith, non-binding, customer forecasts. We maintain EDI connections with our OEM suppliers to send purchase orders, receive purchase order status and receive notification once the product has shipped from our supplier. Our information system also tracks warehouse and channel inventory levels and open purchase orders on a real-time basis enabling us to stock inventory at a regional level closer to the customer as well as to actively manage our working capital resources. This level of automation promotes greater efficiencies of inventory management by replenishing and turning inventory, as well as placing purchase orders on a more frequent basis. Furthermore, our system tool also allows for automated checks and controls to prevent the generation of inaccurate orders.

Managing our OEM supplier incentive programs is another critical function of our purchasing and product management teams. We also attempt to maximize the benefits of incentives, rebates and volume and early payment discounts that our OEM suppliers offer us. We carefully evaluate these supplier incentive benefits relative to our product handling and carrying costs so that we do not over-invest in our inventory. We also closely monitor inventory levels on a product-by-product basis and plan purchases to take advantage of OEM supplier provided price protection. By managing inventory levels and monitoring customer purchase patterns at each of our regional distribution facilities, we believe we can minimize our shipping costs by stocking products near our resellers and retailers, and their end-user customers.
Financial Services
 We offer various financing options to our customers as well as prepayment, credit card and cash on delivery terms. In providing credit terms to our reseller and retail customers, we closely and regularly monitor their creditworthiness through our information systems, their credit ratings information and periodic detailed credit file reviews by our financial services staff. We have also purchased credit insurance in most geographies to further control customer credit risks. Finally, we establish reserves for estimated credit losses in the normal course of business based on the overall quality and aging of our accounts receivable portfolio, the existence of credit insurance and specifically identified customer risks.
 We also sell to certain reseller customers pursuant to third party floor plan financing. The expenses charged by these financing companies are subsidized either by our OEM suppliers or paid by us. We generally receive payment from these financing companies within 15 to 30 days from the date of sale, depending on the specific arrangement.
 Information Technology
 Our IT systems manage the entire order cycle, including processing customer orders, customer billing and payment tracking. These IT systems make our operations more efficient and provide visibility into our operations. We believe our IT infrastructure is scalable to support further growth. We continue to enhance and invest in our IT systems to improve product and inventory management, streamline order and fulfillment processes, and increase operational flexibility, including as part of the integration process related to the Merger.
 To allow our customers and suppliers to communicate and transact business with us in an efficient and consistent manner, we have implemented a mix of proprietary and off-the-shelf software programs that integrate our IT systems with those of our customers and suppliers. In particular, we maintain EDI, XML, web-based communication links and mobile platform applications with many of our reseller and retail customers to enable them to search for products, check real-time pricing, inventory availability and specifications, place and track orders, receive invoices and process returns.
 Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive global environment. The IT product industry is characterized by intense competition, based primarily on product availability, credit terms and availability, price, speed and accuracy of delivery, effectiveness of sales and marketing programs, ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of product lines and training, pre- and post-sale technical support, flexibility and timely response to design changes, technological capabilities and product quality, service and support. We compete with a variety of regional, national and international IT product distributors and manufacturers.
 We compete against several distributors in the Americas market, including Arrow Electronics, Inc. (“Arrow”), Ingram Micro, Inc. and ScanSource, Inc. and, to a lesser extent, regional distributors. The competitive environment in Europe is more fragmented with market share spread among several regional and local competitors such as ALSO Holding and Esprinet, as well as international distributors such as Ingram Micro, Inc., Westcon-Comstor and Arrow. We also face competition from our OEM suppliers that sell directly to resellers, retailers and end-users. The distribution industry has historically undergone, and continues to undergo, consolidation. Over the years, a number of providers within the IT distribution industry exited or merged with other providers. For example, during fiscal year 2017, we acquired the Westcon-Comstor Americas distribution business and Tech Data acquired the Technology Solutions operating group of Avnet Inc. (“Avnet”), and in fiscal year 2021 we acquired Tech Data. We have participated in this consolidation and expect to continue to assess opportunities.
 As we enter new business areas, we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors and/or new competitors. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, operating, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Some of our competitors may have broader geographic breadth and range of services than us. Some may have more developed relationships with their existing customers. 
 We constantly seek to expand our business into areas primarily related to our core distribution as well as other support, logistics and related value-added services, both organically and through strategic acquisitions.

Human Capital Resources
 As of November 30, 2021, we had approximately 22,000 full-time co-workers. Given the variability in our business and the quick response time required by customers, it is critical that we are able to rapidly ramp-up and ramp-down our operational capabilities to maximize efficiency. As a result, we use temporary or contract workers, who totaled approximately 5,000 as of November 30, 2021, on a full-time equivalent basis. Certain of our employees in various countries outside of the United States are subject to laws providing representation rights to employees through workers' councils.
 We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that attracts and retains exceptional talent. Through ongoing employee development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety and employee wellbeing, we strive to help our employees in all aspects of their lives so they can do their best work.
 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 We are committed to being unconditionally inclusive to capture the ideas and perspectives that fuel innovation and enable our workforce, customers, and communities to succeed in the digital age. We strive to create an inclusive workplace where people can bring their authentic selves to work. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with a highly skilled and diverse board of directors. Women represent 27% of our board of directors and 42% of our co-worker base, and 55% of our board of directors is ethnically diverse and/or gender diverse. We strive to remain a diverse company. Both Robert Huang, founder of our company, and Steve Raymund, founder of Tech Data, wanted to ensure we had the best co-workers regardless of their age, ethnicity, or gender. Their legacy and our primary focus is to work hard, do well, and treat others with respect.
Pay Equity or Total Rewards
 We believe people should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, the location of their job, and their performance. We also review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable. Our practice of reviewing the compensation of employees to ensure consistent pay practices by conducting a pay equity analysis annually comparing employees in the same role within a country or location will extend to include employees added from the Merger, during the integration phase.
 We require a talented workforce and are committed to providing total rewards that are market-competitive and performance-based, driving innovation and operational excellence. Our compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment to reward short- and long-term performance that aligns with, and drives, stockholder value. Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and retain key talent.
 
Employee Engagement
 We regularly collect feedback to better understand and improve the co-worker experience and identify opportunities to continually strengthen our culture. We want to know what is working well, what we can do better and how well our co-workers understand and are practicing our cultural values.
 
Training and Development
 Human capital development underpins our efforts to execute our strategy and continue to distribute, design, integrate and market innovative products and services. We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, and external development.

Health, Safety and Wellness
 The physical health, financial wellbeing, life balance and mental health of our employees is vital to our success. Our environmental, health, and safety leadership team uses our global injury and illness reporting system to assess trends regionally and worldwide as a part of quarterly reviews. Our warehouse and integration facilities continue to represent our most significant health and safety risks. Managing and reducing risks at these facilities remains a focus, and injury rates continue to be low. We also sponsor a wellness program designed to enhance physical, financial, and mental wellbeing for all our employees. Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors through regular communications, educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking, wellness challenges, and other incentives. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken an integrated approach to helping our co-workers manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong focus on employee wellbeing, health and safety. We have successfully transitioned most of our workforce to a remote working environment and implemented a number of safety and social distancing measures within our premises to protect the health and safety of co-workers who are required to be on-premise to support our business.
 Environmental
 We remain focused on protecting our planet and reducing our global carbon footprint. In support of this, TD SYNNEX has committed to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) Business Ambition Pledge. We are committed to embedding a culture of sustainability across our organization and increasing our sustainability initiatives and supporting our customers and vendors. We engage in and continue to explore a range of sustainability projects such as renewable energy, use of light emitting diode (LED) technologies, waste minimization projects and ISO 14001 at several of our facilities. We also offer trade-in, recycling and refurbishment services on a range of IT equipment to end-users through agreements with our resellers and retail partners.
