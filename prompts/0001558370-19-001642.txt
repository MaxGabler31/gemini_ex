     Item 1.  Business
     Overview
     We are a Kentucky corporation organized in 1975 for the purpose of conducting business as an investment club. We are headquartered in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  In late 1998 and early 1999 we received regulatory approval to serve as the bank holding company for Citizens First Bank, Inc. (the “Bank”), a Kentucky state chartered bank that commenced operations on February 19, 1999. The Bank currently conducts full-service community banking operations from eight (8) locations in the Kentucky counties of Barren, Hart, Simpson and Warren, and a loan production office in Williamson County, Tennessee.
     We are primarily engaged in the business of accepting demand, savings and time deposits insured by the FDIC and providing commercial, consumer and mortgage loans to the general public. We primarily market our products and services to small and medium-sized businesses and to retail consumers. Our strategy is to provide outstanding service through our employees, who are relationship-oriented and committed to customer service. Through this strategy, we intend to grow our business, expand our customer base and improve our profitability.
     As of December 31, 2018, we had total assets of $476.0 million, total loans of $371.5 million, deposits of $388.6 million and stockholders’ equity of $50.0 million.
     Merger Agreement with German American
     On February 21, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with German American Bancorp, Inc.(“German American”), an Indiana corporation. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Company will merge with and into German American (the “Merger”), with German American as the surviving entity in the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Citizens First Bank, will merge with and into German American’s wholly owned subsidiary, German American Bank ( Bank Merger), with German American Bank as the surviving entity in the Bank Merger. The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of each of German American and the Company, and is subject to approval by federal and state banking regulatory authorities, approval by the shareholders of the Company and certain other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
     Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each record holder of the Company’s common stock (other than "dissenting shares" and shares of the Company’s common stock held by the Citizens First Bank 401k plan), is to receive (a) 0.6629 share of German American common stock in a tax-free exchange (“Exchange Ratio”), plus (b) a cash payment of $5.80 in the Merger. The 401(k) plan is to receive, for each share of the Company’s common stock held by the 401(k) plan at the time of the Merger, a cash payment equal to $5.80 plus the product of the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the greater of (i) the average trading price of German American common stock during the 20 trading days ending on the trading day that is the second business day preceding the closing, and (ii) the closing trading price of the German American common stock on the trading day that is the first business day preceding the closing date of the Merger, each as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. The cash payment per outstanding share (including each 401(k) share) described above are also subject to reduction in the event the "Effective Time Book Value" (as defined in and calculated pursuant to the Merger Agreement) of the Company falls below certain thresholds at the time of closing of the Merger. Immediately prior to closing the Merger,

the Company is to make cash payments to the holders of certain outstanding performance units granted under the Citizens First Corporation 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan, in lieu of distributing the Company’s common shares to such holders.
     The Merger Agreement contains (a) representations and warranties of German American and the Company, (b) covenants of the Company to conduct its business in the ordinary course until the Merger is completed, (c) covenants of the Company to use reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business organization and assets and maintain its rights and franchises, and (d) covenants of German American and the Company to take, or not to take, certain actions during the term of the Merger Agreement. The Company has also agreed not to (a) solicit proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions or (b) maintain discussions concerning any proposals for alternative business combination transactions. The representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement are qualified by disclosures set out in confidential disclosure schedules and should not be relied upon by investors.
     Each party's obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to various conditions, including (a) receipt of the requisite approval of the holders of the Company’s common stock of the Merger, (b) receipt of regulatory approvals, (c) effectiveness of the registration statement to be filed by German American with respect to the German American common stock to be issued in the Merger, (d) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (e) compliance by the other party with its covenants in all material respects, and (f) the absence of a material adverse effect as to the other party.
           The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for German American and the Company, as the case may be, applicable upon: (i) certain adverse regulatory decisions in relation to the Merger, (ii) if the Merger has not been closed by October 1, 2019; (iii) a failure of the other party to comply with such party's covenants (subject to certain rights to cure in certain cases) or a breach of the representations and warranties by the other party that would have a material adverse effect on such party; or (iv) if the Company’s shareholders fail to approve the Merger by the required vote. Under certain circumstances, termination of the Merger Agreement may result in the payment of a termination fee of $2.5 million by the Company to German American, as more fully described in the Merger Agreement.
     Lending Activities
     General. We offer a variety of loans, including commercial and residential real estate mortgage loans, construction loans, commercial loans and consumer loans to individuals and small to mid-size businesses that are located in or conduct a substantial portion of their business in our market area.  Our underwriting standards vary for each type of loan, as described below. At December 31, 2018, we had total loans of $371.5 million, representing 78.0% of our total assets.
     Commercial Loans.  We make commercial loans primarily to small and medium-sized businesses. These loans are secured and unsecured and are made available for general operating inventory and accounts receivables, as well as any other purposes considered appropriate. We will generally look to a borrower’s business operations as the principal source of repayment, but will also require, when appropriate, security interests in personal property and personal guarantees. In addition, the majority of commercial loans that are not mortgage loans are secured by a lien on equipment, inventory and other assets of the commercial borrower. These loans are generally considered to have greater risk than first and second mortgages on real estate because these loans may be unsecured or, if they are secured, the value of the collateral may be difficult to assess and more likely to decrease than real estate.  At December 31, 2018, commercial loans amounted to $61.6 million, or 16.6% of our total loan portfolio, excluding for these purposes commercial loans secured by real estate which are included in the commercial real estate category.  At December 31, 2018, our commercial loans had an average size of $109,000 and the largest loan was $4.8 million.
     Commercial Real Estate Loans.  We originate and maintain a significant amount of commercial real estate loans. This lending involves loans secured by multi-family residential units, income-producing properties and owner-occupied commercial properties. Loan amounts generally conform to the regulatory loan-to-value guidelines and amortizations match the economic life of the collateral, with a maximum amortization schedule of 20 years. Loans secured by commercial real estate are generally subject to a maximum term of 20 years. At December 31, 2018, total commercial real estate loans amounted to $217.6 million, or 58.6% of our loan portfolio. At December 31, 2018, our commercial real estate loans had an average size of $428,000 and the largest loan was $7.1 million.
     Residential Real Estate Mortgage Loans.  We originate residential real estate mortgage loans with either fixed or variable interest rates to borrowers to purchase and refinance one-to-four family properties. We also offer home equity loans and 

 
  Page 5

 
home equity lines of credit.  Real estate mortgage loans are subject to the same general risks as other loans and are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the value of real estate, which could negatively affect a borrower’s cash flow, creditworthiness and ability to repay the loan.  Except for home equity loans and lines of credit, substantially all of our residential real estate loans are secured by a first lien on the real estate.  Loans secured by residential real estate with variable interest rates will have a maximum term and amortization schedule of 30 years.  We sell to the secondary market the majority of our residential fixed-rate mortgage loans, thereby reducing our interest rate risk and credit risk. Loans secured by vacant land are generally subject to a maximum term of five years and a maximum amortization schedule of five years. At December 31, 2018, total residential real estate loans amounted to $88.8 million, or 23.9% of our loan portfolio. At December 31, 2018, our residential real estate mortgage loans had an average size of $81,000 and the largest loan was $3.8 million.
     We provide customers access to long-term conventional real estate loans through our mortgage loan division, which underwrites loans that are purchased by unaffiliated third party brokers in the secondary market.  We receive fees in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, with these fees aggregating $320,000 and $317,000 for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  We do not retain servicing rights with respect to the secondary market residential mortgage loans that we originate.
     Consumer.  We make personal loans and lines of credit available to consumers for various purposes, such as the purchase of automobiles, boats and other recreational vehicles, and the making of home improvements and personal investments. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than residential mortgage loans and usually involve more credit risk than mortgage loans because of the type and nature of the collateral. Consumer lending collections are dependent on a borrower’s continuing financial stability and are thus likely to be adversely affected by job loss, illness or personal bankruptcy. In many cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan will not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of depreciation of the underlying collateral. We emphasize the amount of the down payment, credit quality and history, employment stability and monthly income. These loans are expected generally to be repaid on a monthly repayment schedule with the payment amount tied to the borrower’s periodic income. 
     We believe that the generally higher yields earned on consumer loans help compensate for the increased credit risk associated with such loans and that consumer loans are important to our efforts to serve the credit needs of our customer base.  At December 31, 2018, total consumer loans amounted to $3.6 million, or 0.9% of our loan portfolio. At December 31, 2018, our consumer loans had an average size of $5,000, and the largest loan was $234,000.
     Loan Underwriting and Approval.  We seek to make sound, high quality loans while recognizing that lending money involves a degree of business risk.  Our loan policies are designed to assist us in managing this business risk.  These policies provide a general framework for our loan operations while recognizing that not all risk activities and procedures can be anticipated.  Our loan policies instruct lending personnel to use care and prudent decision making and to seek the guidance of our Chief Credit Officer, our Vice President Credit Risk Officer, our Senior Vice President Credit Administration or our President and Chief Executive Officer where appropriate.
     Deposit Products
     Our principal source of funds is core deposits.  We offer a range of deposit products and services including checking accounts, savings accounts, NOW accounts, money market accounts, sweep accounts, fixed and variable rate IRA accounts, Christmas Club accounts and certificate of deposit accounts.  We solicit accounts from a wide variety of customers, including individuals and small to medium-sized businesses.  We actively pursue business checking accounts by offering competitive rates and other convenient services to our business customers.  In some cases, we require business customers to maintain minimum balances.  We offer a deposit pick-up service to our commercial customers that enable these customers to make daily cash deposits through one of our couriers.  At December 31, 2018, we had total deposits of $388.6 million.     Other Banking Services
     Our retail banking strategy is to offer basic banking products and services that are attractively priced and easily understood by the customer.  We focus on making our products and services convenient and readily accessible to the customer.  In addition to banking during normal business hours, we offer extended drive-through hours, ATMs, and banking by telephone, mail and personal appointment.  We have ten ATMs located within our markets. We also provide debit cards, 

  Page 6

 
credit cards, safekeeping and safe deposit boxes, ACH and other direct deposit services, savings bond redemptions, cashier’s checks, travelers’ checks and letters of credit.  We have also established relationships with correspondent banks and other independent financial institutions to provide other services requested by customers, including cash management services, wire transfer services, and loan participations where the requested loan amount exceeds the lending limits imposed by law or by our policies.  We maintain an internet banking website at www.citizensfirstbank.com, which allows customers to obtain account balances and transfer funds among accounts.  The website also provides online bill payment and electronic delivery of customer statements.
     We provide title insurance services to mortgage loan customers for a fee.  Through third party providers, we offer other insurance services and trust services and receive a fee for referrals.  We offer non-deposit investment services and products through an agreement with a broker-dealer.  We earn advisory fees and commissions from the sale of these services and products.  The objective of offering these products and services is to generate fee income and strengthen relationships with our customers.
     Competition and Market Area
     The banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in our market from many other financial institutions. Our profitability depends upon our ability to compete in the market area in which our bank offices are located.  We compete for deposits, loans and other banking services generally on the basis of convenient office locations, interest rates offered on deposit accounts and charged on loans, fees and the range of services offered. We compete with existing area financial institutions other than commercial banks and savings banks, including commercial bank loan production offices, mortgage companies, insurance companies, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, credit unions, money market funds and other business entities which have recently entered traditional banking markets.
     Along with its headquarters in Bowling Green, the Bank currently operates eight (8) full-service banking facilities in the counties of Warren, Simpson, Barren and Hart in south central Kentucky, as well as a loan production office in Williamson County, Tennessee. Our market area consists primarily of a ten county region located in south central Kentucky known as the Barren River Area Development District.  This region consists of Allen, Barren, Butler, Edmonson, Hart, Logan, Metcalfe, Monroe, Simpson, and Warren Counties in Kentucky. As of June 30, 2018, there were 20 financial institutions operating a total of 67 offices in the Bowling Green MSA. In addition, there are six financial institutions operating a total of seven offices in Simpson County, four institutions operating a total of six offices in Hart County and nine financial institutions operating 21 offices in Barren County.
     Employees
     At December 31, 2018, we had 97 full-time equivalent employees.  Management considers its relations with its employees to be good. Neither we nor the Bank are a party to any collective bargaining agreement.     Supervision and Regulation
     We are subject to the extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. This framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund and the banking system as a whole, and generally is not intended for the protection of stockholders or other investors. Described below are the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to us and the Bank. These descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described. Changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their interpretation and application by regulatory agencies and other governmental authorities, cannot be predicted, but may have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
     Applicable laws and regulations restrict our permissible activities and investments and impose conditions and requirements on the products and services we offer and the manner in which they are offered and sold. They also restrict our ability to repurchase stock or pay dividends, or to receive dividends from our banking subsidiary, and impose capital adequacy requirements on us and our banking subsidiary. The consequences of noncompliance with these laws and regulations can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions.
     As described in more detail below, comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory landscape occurred with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act implements numerous and far-reaching changes that affect 

 
  Page 7

 
financial companies, including banking organizations. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other laws are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. Some of the regulations related to these reforms are still in the implementation stage and, as a result, there is significant uncertainty concerning their ultimate impact on us.
     In addition to banking laws, regulations and regulatory agencies, we are subject to various other laws, regulations, supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect our operations and management.
     Overview
     We are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act). As such, we are subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Federal Reserve Board) under the BHC Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We are required to file periodic reports of our operations and any additional information the Federal Reserve may require.
     The Bank is a member of the FDIC and, as such, its deposits are insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by law. The Bank is a state bank chartered under the banking laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. As a result, it is subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of both the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions (KDFI) and the FDIC.
     We are subject to numerous state and federal statutes and regulations that affect our business activities and operations, including restrictions on loan limits, interest rates, “insider” loans to officers, directors, and principal shareholders, tie-in arrangements and transactions with affiliates, among other things.  Federal and state regulators also have authority to impose substantial sanctions on the Bank and its directors and officers if we engage in unsafe or unsound practices, or otherwise fail to comply with regulatory standards. Supervisory agreements, such as memoranda of understanding entered into with federal and state bank regulators, may also impose requirements and reporting obligations.
     Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act
     On May 25, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the "Regulatory Relief Act") was signed into law. The Regulatory Relief Act was designed to provide regulatory relief for banking organizations, particularly for all but the very largest, those with assets in excess of $250 billion. Bank holding companies with assets of less than $100 billion are no longer subject to enhanced prudential standards, and those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be relieved of those requirements in 18 months, unless the Federal Reserve Board takes action to maintain those standards. Certain regulatory requirements applied only to banks with assets in excess of $50 billion and so did not apply to the Company even before the enactment of the Regulatory Relief Act.
     The Regulatory Relief Act also provides that the banking regulators must adopt regulations implementing the provision that banking organizations with assets of less than $10 billion are permitted to satisfy capital standards and be considered "well capitalized" under the prompt corrective action framework if their leverage ratios of tangible assets to average consolidated assets is between 8% and 10%, unless the banking organization's federal banking agency determines that the banking organization's risk profile warrants a more stringent leverage ratio. The OCC, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have proposed for comment the leverage ratio framework for any banking organization with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, limited amounts of certain types of assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9%. The community bank leverage ratio would be calculated as the ratio of tangible equity capital divided by average total consolidated assets. Tangible equity capital would be defined as total bank equity capital or total holding company equity capital, as applicable, prior to including minority interests, and excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, goodwill and other intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing assets). Average total assets would be calculated in a manner similar to the current tier 1 leverage ratio denominator in that amounts deducted from the community bank leverage ratio numerator would also be excluded from the community bank leverage ratio denominator.
     The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) also adopted a rule providing banking organizations with the option to phase in over a three-year 

 
  Page 8

 
period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of new current expected credit loss methodology accounting under U. S. generally accepted accounting principles.
     The Regulatory Relief Act also relieves bank holding companies and banks with assets of less than $100 billion in assets from certain record-keeping, reporting and disclosure requirements.
     Acquisitions
     A bank holding company must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting stock or all or substantially all of the assets of a bank, merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company and before engaging, or acquiring a company that is not a bank but is engaged in certain non-banking activities. Federal law also prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company without notifying the Federal Reserve Board in advance and then only if the Federal Reserve Board does not object to the proposed transaction. The Federal Reserve Board has established a rebuttable presumptive standard that the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 would constitute an acquisition of control of the bank holding company. In addition, any company is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of any class of a bank holding company’s voting securities, or otherwise obtaining control or a “controlling influence” over a bank holding company.
     Permissible Activities under the BHC Act
     A bank holding company is generally permitted under the BHC Act to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in banking or managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for our subsidiaries and any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking.
     As a bank holding company, we may elect to become a financial holding company, which enables the holding company to conduct activities that are “financial in nature.” Activities that are “financial in nature” include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. We have not sought financial holding company status. If we were to elect in writing for financial holding company status, each insured depository institution we controlled would have to be well capitalized, well managed and have at least a satisfactory CRA rating.
     Capital Requirements
     We are required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve at the holding company level, and the FDIC at the bank level. Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital requirements or more restrictive ratios separately established for a financial institution by its regulators could subject a bank or bank holding company to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits and other restrictions on its business.
     Effective January 1, 2015, (subject to certain phase-in provisions), we became subject to the final rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital reforms. The Basel III rules, among other things, (i) introduce a new capital measure called common equity Tier 1 (CET1), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations.
     The minimum capital level requirements applicable to bank holding companies and banks subject to the rules are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The preamble to the final rules states that these quantitative calculations are minimums and that the agencies may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. 

 
  Page 9

 

 The rules also establish a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios, and result in the following minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7%, (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if capital levels fall below minimum plus the buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.
     Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, limited amounts of minority interest in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, and non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, subject to certain eligibility standards, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions. Cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010, will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, but such securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, including, in the case of bank holding companies with less than $15.0 billion in total assets on December 31, 2009, trust preferred securities issued prior to that date, will continue to count as Tier 1 capital subject to certain limitations. The definition of Tier 2 capital is generally unchanged for most banking organizations, subject to certain new eligibility criteria.
     Common equity Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings plus limited amounts of minority interest in the form of common stock, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions.
     Bank holding companies and banks are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements. These requirements provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated quarterly average assets (as defined for regulatory purposes), net of the loan loss reserve, goodwill and certain other intangible assets (the “leverage ratio”), of 4.0% for all bank holding companies.
     Safety and Soundness Standards
     Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. Additionally, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the FDIA. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.     Prompt Corrective Action
     The FDIA establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators established five capital categories (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized), into one of which each institution is placed. With respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories, the regulators must take prescribed supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category into which the institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category.  As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was well-capitalized.
     An institution that is classified as well-capitalized based on its capital levels may be treated as adequately capitalized, and an institution that is adequately capitalized or undercapitalized based upon its capital levels may be treated as though it were undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized, respectively, if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment.

 If a bank is not well capitalized, it cannot accept brokered deposits without prior FDIC approval. Even if approved, rate restrictions apply governing the rate the bank may be permitted to pay on the brokered deposits. In addition, a bank that is undercapitalized cannot offer an effective yield in excess of 75 basis points over the “national rate” paid on deposits (including brokered deposits, if approval is granted for the bank to accept them) of comparable size and maturity. The “national rate” is defined as a simple average of rates paid by insured depository institution and branches for which data are available and is published weekly by the FDIC. Institutions subject to the restrictions that believe they are operating in an area where the rates paid on deposits are higher than the “national rate” can use the local market to determine the prevailing rate if they seek and receive a determination from the FDIC that it is operating in a high-rate area. Regardless of the determination, institutions must use the national rate to determine conformance for all deposits outside their market area.
     An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. A bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan, subject to limitations. The controlling bank holding company’s obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution and a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital.
     An insured depository institution may not pay a management fee to a bank holding company controlling that institution or any other person having control of the institution if, after making the payment, the institution would be undercapitalized. In addition, an institution cannot make a capital distribution, such as a dividend or other distribution that is in substance a distribution of capital to the owners of the institution if following such a distribution the institution would be undercapitalized. Thus, if payment of such a management fee or the making of such capital distribution would cause the Bank to become undercapitalized, it could not pay a management fee or dividend to us.
     Dividends
     We are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The principal source of our cash flow is dividends paid to us by the Bank. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the Bank’s ability to pay dividends to us as well as to our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.  Under Kentucky law, the Company is not permitted to pay dividends to the extent they result in the insolvency of the corporation from a balance sheet perspective or the corporation becoming unable to pay debts as they come due.
     In addition to state law limitations on the Company’s ability to pay dividends, the Federal Reserve imposes limitations on the Company’s ability to pay dividends.  As noted above, effective January 1, 2016, Federal Reserve limitations limit dividends, stock repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if the Company’s regulatory capital is below the level of regulatory minimums plus the applicable capital conservation buffer.
     Statutory limitations also apply to the Bank’s payment of dividends to the Company.  Under Kentucky law, dividends by Kentucky banks may be paid only from current or retained net profits. The Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions must approve the declaration of dividends if the total dividends to be declared by a bank for any calendar year would exceed the bank’s total net profits for such year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of preferred stock or debt.
     The payment of dividends by the Bank may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the FDIA, an insured institution may not pay a dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued policy statements stating that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings, and the new capital rules prohibit the payment of dividends when a holding company or insured depository institution is not in compliance with the capital conservation buffer described elsewhere in this report.

 The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including new regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to us.     Transactions with Affiliates
     Both the Company and the Bank are subject to the provisions of Section 23A and Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. Section 23A places limits on the amount of a bank’s loans or extensions of credit to affiliates, a bank’s investment in an affiliate, assets a bank may purchase from affiliates, except for real and personal property exempted by the obligations of affiliates, the amount of loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates, transactions involving the borrowing or lending of securities and any derivative transaction that results in credit exposure to an affiliate, and a bank’s guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate.
     The total amount of the above transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of a bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of a bank’s capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, each of the above transactions must also meet specified collateral requirements. The Bank must also comply with other provisions designed to avoid the taking of low-quality assets. Section 23B prohibits an institution from engaging in the above transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies.
     Source of Strength
     Under the Dodd-Frank Act, and previously under Federal Reserve policy, we are required to act as a source of financial strength for and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances in which might not otherwise do so. This support may be required at times when, absent such Federal Reserve policy, we may not be inclined to provide it. If the Bank were to become undercapitalized, we would be required to provide a guarantee of the Bank’s plan to return to capital adequacy. In addition, any loans by a bank holding company to any of its banking subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to other indebtedness of such banks. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a banking subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.     Branching
     With prior regulatory approval and/or notices, as applicable, Kentucky law permits banks based in the state to either establish new or acquire existing branch offices throughout Kentucky. As a result of the Dodd Frank Act, the Bank and any other national or state chartered bank may branch across state lines to the same extent as banks chartered in the state of the branch.
     FDIC Insurance
     Deposits in the Bank are insured by the FDIC subject to applicable limitations. To offset the cost of this insurance, the FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system for insured depository institutions that takes into account the risks attributable to different categories and concentrations of assets and liabilities and the size of the institutions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted regulations that base deposit insurance assessments on total assets less capital rather than deposit liabilities and include off-balance sheet liabilities of institutions and their affiliates in risk-based assessments.
     The Dodd-Frank Act increased the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage to $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act also repealed the prohibition on paying interest on demand transaction accounts.
     The FDIC may terminate its insurance of an institution’s deposits if it finds that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.

 Community Reinvestment
     The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”) requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, amount other things, providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility.  The applicable federal regulators regularly conduct CRA examinations to assess the performance of financial institutions and assign one of four ratings to the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community. During its last examination, a rating of “satisfactory” was received by the Bank.     Consumer Protection Laws
     The Bank is subject to consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The Bank’s loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions such as the:
· | Federal Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Bank Secrecy Act, governing how banks and other firms report certain currency transactions and maintain appropriate safeguards against “money laundering” activities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Civil Relief Act of 1940, governing the repayment terms of, and property rights underlying, secured obligations of persons in active military service; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing the federal laws.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The Bank’s deposit operations are subject to the:
    
· | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve to implement that act, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities (including with respect to the permissibility of overdraft charges) arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.

      Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
     Dodd-Frank created a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but are examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to 

  Page 13

 
prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. Dodd-Frank permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.
 Volcker Rule. On December 10, 2013, the final Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act was approved and implemented by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Volcker Rule attempts to reduce risk and banking system instability by restricting U.S. banks from investing in or engaging in proprietary trading and speculation and imposing a strict framework to justify exemptions for underwriting, market-making and hedging activities. U.S. banks are restricted from investing in funds with collateral comprised of less than 100% loans that are not registered with the SEC and from engaging in hedging activities that do not hedge a specific identified risk. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act exempted banks, like the Bank, which have less than $10 billion in assets and no material trading assets and liabilities from the Volcker Rule.
     Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity
     The federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services.
     In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing Internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.
     Anti-Money Laundering; USA Patriot Act
     Financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures, and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. We are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence in dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. We also must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions. Recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks. Anti-money laundering obligations have been substantially strengthened as a result of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA Patriot Act), enacted in 2001, renewed in 2006 and extended, in part, in 2011. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications.
     The USA Patriot Act amended, in part, the Bank Secrecy Act and provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering. The statute also creates enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the U.S. government, including: (1) requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; (2) promulgating rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering; (3) requiring reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the 

 
  Page 14

 
Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for transactions exceeding $10,000; and (4) mandating the filing of suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations. The statute also requires enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer, maintain, or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons.
     On May 11, 2016, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (the “FinCen”) issued new anti-money laundering (“AML”) rules governing corporate entities doing business with banks and other financial institutions that are subject to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act.  The AML rules impose significant due diligence obligations on financial institutions with respect to opening of new accounts and the monitoring of existing accounts.  Under the AML rules, a financial institution must identify persons owning or controlling 25% or more of a “legal entity”, whenever the legal entity opens a new account at the bank.  The financial institution must also identify an individual who has substantial management authority as the legal entity, such as a CEO, CFO, or managing partner.
     The Federal Bureau of Investigation may send bank regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. The Bank may be subject to a request for a search of its records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists and may be required to report any identified relationships or transactions. Furthermore, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC has sent, and will send, bank regulatory agencies lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must freeze such account, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.
     Proposed Legislation and Regulatory Action
     Congress may enact further legislation that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact further legislation affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operation in these states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied.  We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof, although enactment of the proposed legislation could impact the regulatory structure under which the Company operates and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an increase in regulatory capital, may require modifications of the Company’s business strategy, and limit the Company’s ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner.  A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicate to the Company or the Bank could have a material effect on our business.     Effects of Governmental Policies and Economic Conditions
     Our earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, and its agencies. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through the Federal Reserve’s statutory power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The Federal Reserve, through its monetary and fiscal policies, affects the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of United States government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which member banks are subject. We cannot predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary or fiscal policies.     Available Information
