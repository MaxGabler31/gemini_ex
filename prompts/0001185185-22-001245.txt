General Information



Nowtransit Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 8, 2019 and has a fiscal year end of August 31. We have not generated material revenues, have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. We were formed to engage in the online delivery business, but in connection with the Change of Control described in the following paragraph, the Company terminated its plans in the online delivery business. Since the Change of Control, we commenced seeking new business opportunities in the United States.
Possible Reverse Merger



On August 15, 2022, we executed a non-binding Term Sheet with an early-stage nutraceutical company (the “Target”). The Term Sheet required the Share Exchange Agreement to be executed by September 15, 2022. Although it was not, we are continuing to pursue the acquisition under which the shareholders of the Target would receive approximately 84.43% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, the Term Sheet envisioned one or more investors investing $50,000 and receiving convertible preferred stock, convertible into approximately 0.84% of our outstanding common stock (the “Financing”). The Target recently consummated a financing in the amount of $50,000 with an investor and we therefore do not anticipate consummating the Financing if the reverse merger with the Target is consummated.
Change of Control



On April 2, 2021, Justin Earl purchased from Ivan Homici 2,800,000 shares of common stock of Nowtransit Inc. (the “Company”), for a total purchase price of $28,000 (the “Change of Control”). The Change of Control was effected pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated April 2, 2021 by and among Mr. Earl as the purchaser, and Mr. Homici, the Company’s majority shareholder and sole director and officer, as the seller. Following the Change of Control, Mr. Earl owns 2,800,000 shares of common stock, which constitutes approximately 51.3% of the common stock issued and outstanding.



On July 29, 2021, Mr. Homici resigned as the Company’s director, President, Treasurer and Secretary and was replaced in each such role by Mr. Earl.

Business Overview



The Company currently has no operations and is seeking to acquire a new business in the United States, including potentially by means of a reverse merger with an operating entity. We have not generated revenues since we divested our operating subsidiaries and do not expect to do so in the short-term due to the early stage nature of our Company.



The evaluation and selection of a business opportunity is a complex and uncertain process. While we are hopeful of closing the reverse merger with the Target, we cannot assure you we will do so. During our last fiscal year, we entered into a different Term Sheet for a reverse merger but terminated it due to items we discovered during our due diligence investigation. This resulted in increased expenses, primarily professional fees.



Competition and Market Conditions



We will face substantial competition in our efforts to identify and pursue a business venture. The primary source of competition is expected to be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, including small venture capital firms, blank check companies, and wealthy investors, many of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In light of our limited financial and human resources, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many of our competitors in our efforts to obtain an operating business or assets necessary to commence our operations in a new field. Additionally, with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, many venture capital firms and similar firms and individuals have been seeking to acquire businesses at discounted rates, and we therefore currently face additional competition and resultant difficulty obtaining a business. We expect these conditions to persist at least until such time as the economy recovers. Further, even if we are successful in obtaining a business or assets for new operations, we expect there to be enhanced barriers to entry in the marketplace in which we decide to operate as a result of reduced demand for products and services, supply shortages and/or increased raw material costs caused by the pandemic and other economic forces that are beyond our control.
Regulation



As of the date of this Report, we voluntarily file certain reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). If we complete the reverse merger with the Target, we expect that will become a mandatory filer under the Exchange Act.



Depending on the direction management decides to take and a business or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may become subject to other laws or regulations that require us to make material expenditures on compliance including the increasing state level regulation of privacy. Any such requirements could require us to divert significant human and capital resources on compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results.



Employees



As of the date of this Report, we do not have employees other than Justin Earl, our sole officer.
