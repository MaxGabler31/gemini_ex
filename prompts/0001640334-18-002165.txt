General and Historical Overview of Our Business
 
The Company was formed on December 9, 2004 under the laws of the State of Nevada as an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties in the United States and Canada. In March of 2014, the Company began its entry into the bioscience and alternative health and wellness business and discontinued its involvement in the oil and gas business in November 2014. In May 2016, the Company commenced out-licensing its patented technology for improved delivery of bioactive compounds that promotes healthy ingestion methods, lower overall dosing and higher effectiveness in active molecule delivery. The Company has its office in Kelowna, BC, Canada.
 
Effective at the opening of trading on October 28, 2009, our shares of common stock began trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange (formerly, Canadian National Stock Exchange) under the trading symbol “LXX”. 
 
Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQX under the symbol “LXRP” and on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the symbol “LXX”.
 
In 2014, the Company submitted an application to enter the legal medical marijuana business in Canada and also launched a hemp oil-based food supplement company in the USA. 
 
The Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Enertopia Corp for a prospective medical marijuana business under the Canadian Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (“MMPR”) for a 49% net ownership interest in the business (Enertopia 51%) utilizing an identified location in Burlington, Ontario.

On June 26, 2015, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Enertopia Corp. and Shaxon Enterprises Ltd. to sell its 49% interest in the Burlington Joint Venture and the MMPR application number 10MMPR0610. Pursuant to the agreement, the joint venture received a non-refundable $10,000 deposit and is entitled to receive up to $1,500,000 in milestone payments upon the Burlington facility becoming licensed under the MMPR. All payments made pursuant to the agreement would be divided 51% to Enertopia Corp. and 49% to Lexaria Bioscience. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company does not expect the grant of a production license for the Burlington facility.
 
The Company’s food sciences activities include the development of our proprietary nutrient infusion technologies for the production of functional foods, and the production of enhanced food products under our two consumer product brands, ViPova™ and Lexaria Energy™. The Company’s patented lipid nutrient infusion technology DehydraTECHTM is believed to improve taste, rapidity and delivery of bioactive compounds that include cannabinoids, vitamins, NSAIDs, nicotine and other molecules compared to what is possible without lipophilic enhancement technology. This can allow for lower overall dosing requirements and/or higher effectiveness in active molecule delivery. 
 
Lexaria has caused to be filed many patent-pending applications with the US Patent Office (USPTO), and also internationally under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). On October 26, 2016, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent No. 9,474,725 B1 (granted June 15 2017 in Australia No. 2015274698), Cannabinoid Infused Food and Beverage Compositions and Methods of Use Thereof, pertaining to Lexaria’s method of improving bioavailability and taste of certain cannabinoid lipophilic active agents in food products. On December 12, 2017, the USPTO granted patent number US 9,839,612 B2 for the use of DehydraTECHTM technology as a delivery platform for a wide variety of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“APIs”) encompassing all cannabinoids including THC; fat soluble vitamins; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain medications (“NSAIDs”); and nicotine. The title of the granted patent is “Food and Beverage Compositions Infused With Lipophilic Active Agents and Methods of Use Thereof”. The USPTO granted on May 15, 2018 patent US 9,972,680 B2 and on May 22, 2018 it granted patent US 9,974,739 B2 within the same patent family. 
 
Lexaria hopes to reduce other common but less healthy administration methods, such as smoking, as it embraces the benefits of its technology for public health. The Company is aggressively pursuing patent protection in national jurisdictions around the world. The Company currently has more than 50 patent applications pending worldwide and, due to the complexity of pursuing patent protection, the quantity of patent applications will vary continuously as each application advances or stalls. Lexaria is also filing new patent applications for novel new discoveries that arise from the Company’s R&D programs and, due to the inherent unpredictability of scientific discovery, it is not possible to predict if or how often such new applications might be filed.
 
On January 5, 2018 the Company filed a Form S-4 Registration Statement and the company held on June 13, 2018, an annual and special meeting of stockholders at the office of our law firm, Macdonald Tuskey located in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, that included as part of the proceedings the approval of the plan of conversion whereby our corporate jurisdiction could be changed from the State of Nevada to the Province of British Columbia, Canada by means of a process called a “conversion” and a “continuation”. Important details for stockholders related to the conversion and the associated risks for the company and stockholders are included in the S-4 Registration Statement. There are risks associated with proceeding or not proceeding with the conversion regarding the increasing complexity of compliance with the regulatory framework and the associated increasing costs, the restrictions on the promotion and sale of our stocks to US investors that limit the potential liquidity of our stock, and an increasingly complex environment that can negatively impact Lexaria even as an ancillary involved company via technology licensing to entities in the state legal cannabidiol and cannabis markets. Amendments to the S-4 as S-4/A and S-4/A No 2 were filed February 7, 2018 and March 1, 2018. 
 
Subsequent to the June 2018 annual and special meeting of stockholders, the Company received expert tax advice that suggests a particular class of shareholder may be exposed to punitive taxes immediately upon conversion of the Company from Nevada to Canada. As a result of this punitive tax treatment the Company has placed on indefinite hold the redomiciling of the Company from the USA to Canada, until such time as a remedy can be discovered. At the Annual General Meeting held June 13, 2018, shareholder approval was obtained to effect the corporate conversion and thus, if and when the inequitable tax treatment problem can be solved, the conversion process can potentially then occur without additional delay.
 
As at August 31, 2018, we had two reportable segments: Intellectual Property Licensing and Consumer Products.

Our Current Business 
 
Our company’s business plan is currently focused on the development of strategic partnerships with licensees for our patented technology in exchange for up front and/or staged licensing fees over time. Secondarily and more generally, we continue to investigate national and international opportunities for development and distribution of the Company’s enhanced functional food and supplement product offerings; to investigate expansions and additions to our intellectual property portfolio; and, to search for additional opportunities in alternative health sectors. This includes the acquisition or development of intellectual property if and when we believe it advisable to do so. We announced issuance of our first patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on October 26, 2016 and have received a Notice of Acceptance from the Australian Patent Office with related patent issuance date June 15 2017 No. 2015274698. On December 12, 2017 patent number US 9,839,612 B2 was issued for the delivery of additional molecules such as psychoactive cannabinoids, vitamins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, and nicotine all utilizing our DehydraTECHTM delivery technology. On March 22, 2018, we received a Notice of Allowance from the USPTO for the delivery of both psychoactive and non-psychoactive cannabinoids as lipophilic active agents formulated together with the edible fatty acids that enable the bioavailability and taste enhancing properties of the DehydraTECH™ technology. On May 22, 2018 patent US 9,974,739 B2, “Food and Beverage Compositions Infused With Lipophilic Active Agents and Methods of Use Thereof” was granted. On April 11, 2018 the Company announced it received a new Notice of Allowance from the USPTO providing claims that protect processes for making specific compositions of matter for enhanced cannabinoid delivery utilizing its DehydraTECH technology. On May 15, 2018 patent US 9,972,680 B2, “Food and Beverage Compositions Infused With Lipophilic Active Agents and Methods of Use Thereof” was granted. 
 
We are seeking additional patent protection for what we believe to be a unique process for the nutritional delivery of certain molecules such as cannabinoids, Nicotine, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), and Vitamins. To achieve sustainable and profitable growth, our company intends to control the timing and costs of our projects wherever possible. We have filed for patent protection of our delivery technology for additional compounds such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors, human hormones such as estrogen and testosterone, and more.
 
During the past fiscal year the Company experienced the following significant corporate developments:

Food Science and Technology
 
Lexaria is a Biotechnology and food science company focused on developing and out-licensing its proprietary technology for improved taste, rapidity, and delivery of bioactive compounds in foods and other ingestible products Lexaria is focusing its capital and management time on its pursuit of intellectual property, technology licensing opportunities, an expanding portfolio of patent pending applications, and functional food and supplement formulations. 
 
On November 11, 2014, our Company acquired 51% of PoViva Tea LLC and executed an operating agreement to develop a business of legally producing, manufacturing, importing/exporting, testing, researching and developing, a line of hemp oil with cannabidiol-infused teas, drinks and foods. On November 2, 2017, we announced that we acquired 100% of PoViva Tea LLC. 
 
The Company introduced an expanding variety of hemp fortified consumer food products throughout 2015 to demonstrate Lexaria’s DehydraTECHTM technology to both consumers and potential licensees. From January 2015 to December 2015, seven (7) flavors of teas; hot chocolate; coffee, and two (2) flavors of protein energy bars were introduced – all utilizing Lexaria’s patented technology DehydraTECHTM for the more palatable and efficient delivery of bioactive molecules infused within those food products.
 
In the production of the products, for each raw material to be used in ViPova™ -branded products, the Company assesses if the product inputs and the completed products comply with all applicable food and drug laws, and that the inputs and the finished products meet all applicable legal and quality standards including and as it relates to hemp oil content; THC content; molds and mildews; heavy metals; and may measure additional components. 
 
The US Federal government, through the US Department of Health and Human Services, owns US Patent #6630507, which among other things, claims that
 


“Cannabinoids have been found to have antioxidant properties, unrelated to NMDA receptor antagonism. This new found property makes cannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of wide variety of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age-related, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and HIV dementia.”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For reference, cannabinoids are compounds that affect cannabinoid receptors located on many human cells. CB1 receptors are widely found within the human brain; and CB2 receptors are found with the human immune system and have been linked to anti-inflammatory and other responses.
 
Despite independent scientific findings in many locations around the world, some regulatory agencies do not officially recognize that a human endocannabinoid system exists.
 
Over one hundred different cannabinoids have been isolated from the cannabis plant, most of which do not have psychoactive properties. One that does have psychoactive properties is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Endocannabinoids are produced naturally in the human body while phytocannabinoids are produced in several plant species, most abundantly in the Cannabis plant.
 
Cannabidiol (“CBD”) is one of the major phytocannabinoid forms of cannabinoids and is not psychoactive, often contributing more than 35% of the extracts from the cannabis plant resin. Cannabidiol occurs naturally in other plant species beyond cannabis. For example, the most widely acknowledged alternative source of phytocannabinoid is in the better understood Echinacea species, in widespread use as a dietary supplement. Most phytocannabinoids are virtually insoluble in water but are soluble in lipids and alcohol. The World Anti Doping Agency (“WADA”) has exempted CBD from its 2018 list of banned substances.
 
The Alternative Health sector is large and growing. A long term Medical Expenditure Panel Survey was conducted from 2002 until 2008 with at least 29,370 subjects asked repeatedly if they had seen any kind of health care practitioner in the previous six months. The survey recorded whether the health care provider was a “complementary and alternative medicine care professional,” including “homeopathic, naturopathic, or herbalist.” 
 


9

 
Between 5.3% and 5.8% of the survey group at any one time reported that they had seen a complementary or alternative medicine provider. Based on the US population of ~328,000,000, this suggests between 17.4 million and 19.0 million Americans are seeking an alternative health care professional at any given time.
 
Meanwhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in an April 2011 NCHS Data Brief, reported that more than 50% of the population uses dietary supplements of one kind or another. Detailed findings from that report included:
 


· | Use of dietary supplements is common among the U.S. adult population. Over 40% used supplements in 1988–1994, and over one-half in 2003–2006. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Multivitamins/multiminerals are the most commonly used dietary supplements, with approximately 40% of men and women reporting use during 2003–2006.
· | Use of supplemental calcium increased from 28% during 1988–1994 to 61% during 2003–2006 among women aged 60 and over. 

 
Status of Operations; Consumer product development and sales
 
More than 150 million Americans drink tea every day, amounting to some 79 billion servings of tea in America every year. Our launch of ViPova™ Tea brand is meant to tap into this existing demand. Part of our corporate strategy is to build national brands through products that large groups of potential customers are already familiar and comfortable with. 
 
PoViva Tea LLC has filed patents pending, and has received four granted patents in the US and four in Australia, to bind active hemp oil ingredients with a lipid, potentially allowing for more efficient and comforting delivery of the CBD or other bioactive substances.
 
Lexaria began producing cash flows from its products in January 2015; focused on the immediate opportunities in the hemp-oil-sectors that are federally legal. Cannabinoids have been found by many researchers to have antioxidant properties and Lexaria plans to use the DehydraTECHTM patented process to infuse hemp oils into a number of popular food and beverages. 
 
Lexaria has launched a line of premium products, always relying on our DehydraTECHTM patented infusion process, to bring hemp oil into the mainstream. Because hemp oil does not have psychoactive properties we expect our products to appeal to the widest possible customer base. To date we have focused our sales efforts across the continental USA. Some studies have found that 3% of the Canadian population regularly consumes hemp food products, while 1% of the American population regularly consumes hemp food products. We believe the consumption of hemp based food products offers exceptional growth possibilities.
 
According to Nutrition Business Journal, the Organic Food sector was a $246 billion industry in the USA during 2014, while Dietary Supplements was a $34.6 billion industry. According to Arcview, state-legal Cannabis was a $4.7 billion US industry in 2015 and expected to grow to over a $20 billion sector before 2025 but is clearly a much smaller industry sector than the more established food sectors. Lexaria has not yet determined whether our hemp oil-infused products will be accepted into any or all three of these particular sectors.
 
Lexaria has a main corporate website as well as smaller e-commerce focused websites devoted to consumer products. The majority of product sales have taken place through the e-commerce websites. A contracted national distribution center ensures rapid and accurate fulfillment of all orders. A 1-800 ordering center has also been placed into operation. 
 
Lexaria had previously launched the “Lexaria Energy” brand that is 100% owned by the Company. Under this brand, the Company plans to develop hemp oil-infused food products for people with active lifestyles, such as protein bars, protein shakes and other similar products. On November 3, 2015, Lexaria Energy10 protein bars became available for retail sales with two flavors. The original contract manufacturer of these protein bars was unable to fulfill additional orders and we have not currently been able to locate and contract an alternative location to manufacture this more complicated food product, with the result that the product is temporarily discontinued while we search for a suitable manufacturing location.

Through the November 2014 acquisition of 51% of Poviva Teas LLC, and October 2017 100% acquisition, Lexaria acquired control of certain patents pending, allowances and grants with the United States Patent Office. Lexaria has worked to broaden the patents and extend their utility to molecules other than those originally named.
 
On June 11, 2015, Lexaria initiated the simultaneous filing of a U.S. utility patent application and an International patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) procedure, both at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). These applications follow the Company’s 2014 and 2015 family of provisional patent application filings in the U.S. and serve two additional broad purposes:
 


1. | Lexaria is seeking protection of its intellectual property under international treaties. To this end Lexaria has filed for PCT patent application protection. There are 148 countries that are signatories to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, including such major markets as Canada, China, India, much of Europe and the Middle East, the United Kingdom and Japan among others. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Lexaria believes its lipid infusion technology has applications beyond the delivery of just cannabinoids. Based on further formulation testing, Lexaria has included additional lipophilic molecules that may be delivered via food and beverage formats utilizing its technology, widely encompassing three major new market opportunities for the Company: Nicotine; Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatories (NSAIDs); and Vitamins.

 
In December 2015, the Company filed two further provisional patent applications in the U.S. These new applications served to further broaden the variety and applicability of base compounds that can be used when formulating the Company’s lipid based technology. The first of these applications identify compounds like edible starches (e.g., tapioca starch) that are commonly used in food products today and could, therefore, serve as a base for formulating and incorporating the Company’s Technology into a wide variety of every day food products. The second of these applications identify emulsifier compounds like gum Arabic that are commonly used in beverage products today in order to facilitate similar flexibility for formulating the Company’s Technology in every day, shelf-stable beverages.
 
On October 26, 2016, the USPTO issued U.S Patent No. 9474725, Cannabinoid Infused Food and Beverage Compositions and Methods of Use Thereof, pertaining to our method of improving bioavailability and taste of certain cannabinoid lipophilic active agents in food products. This is the Company’s first patent granted and has a publish date of October 27, 2016 (June 10 2017 in Australia No. 2015274698) and protects our technology for twenty years. On December 12, 2017, the USPTO granted patent number US 9,839,612 B2 for the use of DehydraTECHTM technology as a delivery platform. On May 22, 2018 patent US 9974739 B2, “Food and Beverage Compositions Infused With Lipophilic Active Agents and Methods of Use Thereof” was granted providing for “composition of matter” claims that protect the specific combination of substances which enable improved taste and bioabsorption properties of its DehydraTECH™ technology for the delivery of cannabinoids. On May 15, 2018 patent US 9972680 B2, “Food and Beverage Compositions Infused With Lipophilic Active Agents and Methods of Use Thereof” was granted providing claims that protect processes for making specific compositions of matter for enhanced cannabinoid delivery utilizing its DehydraTECH™ technology. 
 
The Company does not know and cannot know whether these strategies will be successful, or if successful, how long it will take to gain consumer acceptance and customer loyalty. It can be a challenge to be successful by introducing new consumer products to a competitive retail marketplace, and we can offer no assurances that our products will be a commercial success.
 
International patent protection
 
When Lexaria first began examining the legal medical cannabis market in 2013, the Company believed it could make an impact in perhaps both the Canadian and U.S. marketplaces. Our pursuit and development of technology has expanded our potential area of impact, both geographically and by sector. Because of the applicability of our technology to markets outside of the legal cannabis sector, we have taken the necessary steps to protect that intellectual property within larger global markets, regardless of whether they lie within the medical cannabis sector or in other unrelated sectors.

Additional molecules
 
NICOTINE. More than 99% of all nicotine that is consumed worldwide is delivered through smoking cigarettes. Over 6,000,000 deaths per year, worldwide, are attributed primarily to the delivery of nicotine through the act of smoking according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also estimates that over $170 billion per year is spent just in the USA on direct medical care costs for adult smokers. 69% of U.S. adult smokers want to quit smoking and 43% of US adult smokers have attempted to quit in any twelve-month period.
 
Worldwide, retail cigarette sales were worth $722 billion in 2013, with over 5.7 trillion cigarettes sold to more than 1 billion smokers. 
 
RELEVANCE: Lexaria postulates that delivery of nicotine to satisfy current demand, utilizing our patent pending lipid-delivery technology in common food groups, could shift demand from smoking cigarettes to alternative nicotine-based food products. Since most of the adverse health outcomes of nicotine consumption are associated with the delivery method and only to a lesser degree to the actual ingestion of nicotine, there could be a vast positive community health outcome through the reduction in smoking cigarettes. Additional research and regulatory compliant investigations would need to be conducted before otherwise healthy foods such as tea, coffee or energy bar snacks containing nicotine could be introduced. Nicotine is a named molecule in the latest Lexaria patent applications. 
NSAID. Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatories are the second-largest category of pain management treatment options in the world. The global pain management market was estimated at $22 billion in 2011, with $5.4 billion of this market being served by NSAID’s. The U.S. makes up over one-half of the global market. The opioids market (such as morphine) form the largest single pain management sector but are known to be associated with serious dependence and tolerance issues.
 
Some of the most commonly known NSAIDs are ASA (Aspirin), Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and Acetaminophen (Tylenol). (Acetaminophen is not accepted by all persons to be an NSAID.) Although NSAIDs are generally a safe and effective treatment method for pain, they have been associated with a number of gastrointestinal problems including dyspepsia and gastric bleeding.
 
RELEVANCE: Lexaria postulates that delivery of NSAIDs through a lipid-based mechanism could provide the beneficial properties of pain relief with lessened negative gastrointestinal effects, and also potentially deliver lower dosages of active ingredients with similar pain management outcomes as current pill forms at higher dosages. ASA, Piroxicam, Diclofenac, Indomethacin, Ibuprofen, and Acetaminophen are all named molecules in the latest Lexaria patent applications.
 
VITAMINS. The global vitamin and supplement market is worth $68 billion according to Euromonitor. The category is both broad and deep, comprised of many popular and some lesser known substances. Vitamins in general are thought to be an $8.5 billion annual market in the U.S. The U.S. is the largest single national market in the world, and China and Japan are the 2nd and 3rd largest vitamin markets.
 
Vitamin E is fat soluble and can be incorporated into cell membranes which can protect them from oxidative damage. Global consumption of natural source vitamin E was 10,900 metric tons in 2013 worth $611.9 million. 
 
RELEVANCE: Lexaria postulates that delivery of fat soluble vitamins through its patent-pending lipid-based delivery mechanism may result in less waste and lower dosages required than most current pill forms. As well, ingestion of pills is an unpleasant experience for many people so it is possible that vitamin delivery through common food groups could vastly expand market demand for this sector. Vitamin E is a named molecule in the latest Lexaria patent applications.
 
On August 11, 2015, Lexaria signed a license agreement with PoViva Tea LLC for $10,000, granting Lexaria a 35-year non exclusive worldwide license to unencumbered use of PoViva Tea LLC’s IP Rights, including rights of resale. This license agreement ensures Lexaria has full access to the underlying patent pending infusion technology.

Scientific testing and validation 
 
On August 24, 2015, the Company announced potential industry-changing achievements in enhanced gastro-intestinal absorption of cannabidiol (CBD) utilizing Lexaria’s technology. The third-party testing was conducted in two phases of in vitro tests beginning in June and completed in August, 2015.
 
The independent laboratory results delivered average CBD permeability of 499% of baseline permeability, compared to CBD permeability without Lexaria’s technology. These results exceed Company expectations. This was assessed in a strictly controlled, in vitro experiment using a human intestinal tissue model. Samples of Lexaria’s commercially available CBD-fortified ViPova™ black tea were administered in the model compared with concentration-matched CBD control preparations that lacked Lexaria’s patented formulation and process enhancements. Lexaria believes that its in vitro findings provide compelling evidence of the intestinal absorption enhancing capabilities of its technology, based on which it is exploring opportunities to progress to more advanced, follow-on bioavailability testing in animals. 
 
The tests also showed 325% of baseline gastro-intestinal permeability of CBD comparing Lexaria’s CBD-fortified ViPova™ black tea to a second control of CBD and black tea combined, without Lexaria’s patented formulation enhancements. This confirmed that the specialized processing undertaken by Lexaria during its manufacturing process together with its formulation enhancements, does indeed significantly improve absorption levels.
 
The bioavailability of CBD (or of THC) varies greatly by delivery method. Smoking typically delivers cannabinoids at an average bioavailability rate of 30% (Huestis (2007) Chem. Biodivers. 4:1770–1804; McGilveray (2005) Pain Res. Manag. 10 Suppl. A:15A – 22A). By comparison, orally consumed cannabis edibles typically deliver cannabinoids at an average bioavailability rate of only 5% (Karschner et al. (2011) Clin. Chem. 57:66–75). 
 
The Company’s present findings suggest that its technology may achieve a 5-fold improvement in cannabinoid absorption in edible form over that which can be achieved without its proprietary process and formulation enhancements. This conceptually supports that Lexaria’s technology represents a significant breakthrough in cannabinoid delivery by approximating the high absorption levels achieved as though through administration by smoking, but without the associated negative effects on human health caused by smoking.
 
The tests were completed in two phases culminating with testing using simulated intestinal fluid conditions that delivered these findings. These results were stronger than earlier iterations of the tests that did not use a simulated intestinal fluid environment and contributed to Lexaria’s understanding of the mechanisms at work. For these and other reasons, Lexaria believes that bioavailability testing in animals is likely to yield even stronger absorption results in the presence of natural intestinal fluid conditions.
 
CBD has been repeatedly found to provide beneficial pain relieving, anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety, neuroprotection, anti-psychotic, and anti-convulsive effects among others. Lexaria’s patented technology could significantly reduce individual serving requirements for CBD to consumers. This could lead to reduced costs of consumption for consumers and increased profitability for Lexaria.
 
Lexaria believes that the same technology used to enhance the absorption of CBD in the recent laboratory tests, is applicable to THC, nicotine, NSAIDs and other lipophilic compounds that are widely used today.
 
During January 2015, Lexaria conducted a study of nitric oxide levels in humans, as a biomarker for absorption of cannabidiol, with the expectation that it would provide additional evidence of the efficient absorption of cannabidiol from Lexaria food products enhanced with hemp oil, by demonstrating the elevation of nitric oxide in the human body in response to product ingestion.
 


13

 
The study data from human subjects demonstrated significant elevation of systemic nitric oxide levels as a surrogate biomarker for cannabidiol (CBD) bioabsorption in response to ingestion of Lexaria’s products. This provided clinical support for the CBD bioavailability enhancing properties of Lexaria’s patented technology, on the premise that bioavailable CBD is known to elevate levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide in the human body which, in turn, stimulates release of nitric oxide in the vascular system. 
 
In summary, consuming Lexaria and ViPova™ food products resulted in elevated levels of nitric oxide within the body. The results of the study indicated that all Lexaria and ViPova™ food products elicited significant increases in salivary nitric oxide, achieving levels from 110 µM to as high as 220 µM in the test subjects. The beverage products generally had faster initial responses in as little as 15 minutes after product ingestion, whereas the initial responses from the protein-energy bars required 30 minutes. The faster response time with the beverage products was to be expected, given the relative ease of digesting liquids versus solids. All products sustained their maximum levels of nitric oxide detection through to the 60-minute end-points used in the study, indicating a need for additional study to determine the length of time that nitric oxide levels remain elevated following production consumption.
 
The study assessed six flavors of ViPova™ tea (Yunan Black, Herbal Cherry Black, Earl Grey, Herbal Bengal Chai, Herbal Masala Chai and Decaf English Breakfast), ViPova™ Columbian Supremo Coffee, ViPova™ Hot Chocolate and Lexaria Energy Foods’ Chocolate Berry Date and Cashew Berry Date protein-energy bars.
 
Six healthy human subjects (3 male and 3 female) between the ages of 22 and 65 years of age were recruited for the study. Subjects were screened for cardiovascular and allergic response to hemp products, were non-smokers and did not have any history of substance or alcohol abuse. One product was studied per day across all six subjects, with each subject consuming a full product serving size. Subjects were required to refrain from eating food or using vape products for at least 12 hours before test article administration on each day of the study. Nitric oxide levels in the test subjects were assessed using a commercially available, colorimetric test kit designed to quantify systemic nitric oxide via a detectable salivary marker. Immediately before test article administration each day, all subjects were required to demonstrate a negative baseline nitric oxide saliva test. Subjects were considered to have a negative test strip reading at a level of 20 µM according to the test strip scale, and positive readings anywhere above this. Subjects performed salivary nitric oxide testing at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes’ post-consumption of each product. All subjects remained sedentary from baseline through to the completion of testing for each product. 
 
In August of 2018 we released results from our TurboCBDTM capsules in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind European human clinical study that evaluated TurboCBDTM - a proprietary, DehydraTECH™ powered, cannabidiol (“CBD”) fortified hemp oil capsule developed by Lexaria. The degree and speed of CBD absorption into blood plasma and potential cardiovascular and cognitive performance enhancement in 12 healthy male volunteers were studied.
 
Key bioavailability data highlights from the study comparing the 90 mg dose of Lexaria’s TurboCBD™ to a 90 mg dose of a positive control formulation without Lexaria’s DehydraTECH™ technology were as follows:
 


· | 30 Minutes: CBD delivered from Lexaria’s TurboCBDTM capsules was absorbed much more effectively than from the positive control, delivering 317% more CBD to blood at the 30-minute mark of the study (i.e., 18.4 ng/mL compared to only 4.4 ng/mL on average respectively [95% CI; p=0.051]); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | 60 Minutes: The TurboCBDTM capsules went on to deliver more CBD to the blood at the 60-minute mark (i.e., 38.8 ng/mL) than the positive control capsules were able to reach at any time during the 6-hour study, further demonstrating the exceptional rapidity of action and effectiveness of the TurboCBD™ capsules;
· | 90 Minutes: The TurboCBDTM capsules further went on to deliver significantly more CBD to the blood (86% more) than the positive control capsules at the 90-minute mark (i.e., 53.0 ng/mL compared to only 28.4 ng/mL respectively [95% CI; p=0.034]); 
· | Through to Study Completion: Lexaria’s TurboCBDTM capsules continued to deliver more CBD to blood than the positive control capsules at each subsequent time point in the study through to the 6-hour mark when the study was completed. 


14

 
These results corroborate and confirm other in vitro and in vivo studies that have evaluated Lexaria’s DehydraTECHTM technology. Although this study evaluated absorption only of CBD and its metabolites, Lexaria believes nearly identical bioavailability enhancement results would be achieved with other cannabinoids.
 
We have also completed our first study evaluating DehydraTECHTM used in a topical cream formulation for absorption of CBD through human skin. Results proved significant increases in both speed and quantity of CBD absorption through skin when compared to control formulations. The absorption study was performed on human skin at a California-based laboratory that specializes in Franz diffusion cell skin permeability testing. Lexaria’s DehydraTECHTM technology was used together with a sophisticated oil-in-water emulsion formulation design and compared to a series of matching oil-in-water emulsion formulations prepared with the same CBD inputs, with and without the DehydraTECHTM technology and with and without two leading skin penetration enhancers currently used in the skin products industry. Several factors were measured, including the time required to detect CBD skin penetration and quantity, and peak amounts of CBD absorbed into and through the skin, at multiple testing intervals over a 48-hour duration.
 
Lexaria’s DehydraTECHTM-enabled topical formulation, absent either of the commercial penetration enhancers, was the fastest acting for absorption into the epidermis, dermis or through the skin into the systemic fraction representing permeation into the underlying circulatory system. Lexaria’s DehydraTECHTM-enabled product also had no odour even without the use of perfumes, contrary to other cannabinoid industry products that can be quite strongly odoriferous without the use of masking perfumes.
 
Furthermore, Lexaria’s DehydraTECHTM-enabled topical formulation without the addition of either of the commercial penetration enhancers, demonstrated the highest overall average quantity of CBD delivered through the skin and into the representative systemic fraction of all the formulations tested, with as much as a 225% increase in CBD permeability when compared to the highest performing commercial penetration enhancer formulation assessed and almost a 1,900% increase in CBD permeability when compared to a control formulation that was devoid of both the DehydraTECHTM technology or any commercial penetration enhancers. The commercial skin penetration enhancers only demonstrated performance that was on par or superior to the DehydraTECHTM-enabled formulations tested in so far as total CBD absorption into the shallow epidermis or dermis was concerned.
 
We have also completed our first ingestible nicotine in vivo (animal) absorption study. Lexaria is pursuing the use of its patented DehydraTECHTM technology as a possible new nicotine delivery method, an edible dose absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, with potential both as a nicotine replacement therapy as well as an alternative product format for regular tobacco users. 
 
DehydraTECHTM delivered the following major nicotine absorption performance improvements: 1,160% faster delivery of equivalent peak quantities of nicotine to the bloodstream than achieved with controls (within 15 min vs. 2.9 hours), 148% gain in the quantity of peak nicotine delivery to the bloodstream relative to controls, 560% higher brain levels of nicotine where nicotine effects are focused, compared to controls, Lower urine levels of nicotine excreted than controls, for enhanced nicotine activity and bioavailability over the course of the study, lower quantities of key liver metabolites in the bloodstream than controls as hypothesized, suggesting bypass of first pass liver metabolism.
 
Study Design Parameters:
 
The study was designed to principally assess the relative ingestible nicotine absorption performance of DehydraTECHTM-powered formulations compared to concentration-matched control formulations that lacked any form of delivery enabling technology in rats. Nicotine was administered in a nicotine polacrilex derivative format as is widely commercialized today in nicotine replacement therapy products such as chewing gums. Twelve male rats were divided into four groups of three, such that DehydraTECHTM and control formulations were each tested at a 1 mg/Kg and 10 mg/Kg dosage level. Formulations were administered orally and all rats were cannulated for blood collection at multiple intervals over an 8 hour duration post-dosing with the first data collection at the 15-minute mark. Urine and feces were also collected for up to a 24-hour duration post-dosing, and essential organ tissue samples were also collected for examination after the study. All samples were subjected to analytical testing in order to quantify the levels of nicotine therein, as well as the levels of three major liver metabolites thereof, hydroxycotinine, nicotine N’-oxide and cotinine, in order to assess the relative metabolite levels absorbed by the different formulations. Lexaria’s hypothesis was tested to prove that its DehydraTECHTM technology would influence more rapid and complete intestinal bioabsorption of nicotine lymphatically with less metabolic degradation by the liver. All animals were also assessed for general tolerability of the administered formulations. The study was conducted at the same independent laboratory in Philadelphia where the Company completed its initial cannabidiol absorption study in 2015.

Results & Observations:
 
The Lexaria formulations generally achieved faster absorption, higher peak absorption and higher overall quantities of nicotine, on average, in the blood than the concentration-matched control formulations at both the 1mg and 10 mg/Kg doses tested. Furthermore, as previously reported, there were no obvious signs of gastrointestinal distress such as vomiting or diarrhea indicating that the animals appeared to tolerate the treatment well. 
 
Nicotine blood levels were evaluated multiple times over a period of 8 hours after dosing. In the 10mg/Kg dosing arm, the control formulation required nearly 3 hours to reach similar levels of blood absorption that the Lexaria formulation reached in only 15 minutes. Furthermore, the Lexaria formulation went on thereafter to demonstrate peak plasma levels that were 148% of those achieved by the control formulation. If replicated in human studies, these findings are suggestive that Lexaria’s technology could prove more effective in elevating blood nicotine levels through edible formats much more quickly and substantially than previously theorized, potentially making ingestible nicotine preparations a viable alternative to today’s available product formats while also leading to a more rapid nicotine craving satiation.
 
Analysis of the liver metabolites revealed, as expected, that overall levels in the blood of two of the three metabolites studied were higher in the control group than in the Lexaria formulation group at the 10 mg/Kg dose. This result was especially pronounced in the 45-minute to 2-hour time interval post-dosing which is consistent with the expected timing of release of metabolites in higher quantity into the bloodstream by the liver following normal physiological processing of ingested nicotine with the control preparation, compared to the DehydraTECHTM technology that is believed to elude first pass liver metabolism. The Lexaria formulation also demonstrated lower quantities of nicotine in the rat urine at both doses, which is consistent with the fact that the levels of nicotine in the rat blood remained higher over the duration of the study with the Lexaria formulation than with the control. The study also revealed that the Lexaria formulation at the 10 mg/Kg level achieved up to 5.6-times as much nicotine upon analysis of the rat brain tissue than was recovered with the matching control formulation. These findings together perhaps suggest prolongation of nicotine effectiveness with the Lexaria formulation which may also be beneficial in humans to control cravings over an extended time-period from a single edible nicotine dose.
 
In our follow-up third-party in vivo statistically significant study, including two groups of 20 animals, further defining delivery of nicotine in edible form at each of the 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10-minute intervals post-dosing, with 90.2% greater delivery than the concentration-matched control formulation by the 10-minute mark (95% CI; p=0.044), and significantly greater absorption levels than the control formulation at all subsequent time points in the study. Speed of onset is a key attribute for oral drug administration, and it is of particular importance for the consideration of non-inhalation nicotine delivery formats.
 
Key highlights of the follow-up study are as follows:
 


· | Peak Level: 79% improvement in peak blood levels (maximum concentration or “Cmax”) at 394 ng/mL using Lexaria’s DehydraTECHTM technology vs. 220 ng/mL with the control (95% CI; p=0.0257); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Total Quantity: 94% improvement in total quantity of nicotine delivered (area under the curve or “AUC”) to the blood during the 60-minute course of the study, at 266 hr•ng/mL versus 137 hr•ng/mL (95% CI; p=0.0086); 
· | Rapidity: Lexaria’s technology delivered nicotine into the blood stream by the first time interval of blood sampling at the 2-minute mark. On average, Lexaria’s technology delivered 203 ng/mL to the blood in aggregate of the 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 15-minute time points, compared to only 120 ng/mL in aggregate over the same period by the control, an improvement of 70% (95% CI; p=0.0004).


16

 
In addition to the above described scientific testing and validation studies, Lexaria has also conducted various cannabinoid formulation experiments, together with potential DehydraTECH™ licensee partners, on chocolates, candies, gummies, mouth-melts, chocolate bars, protein bars, beverages such as beer, spices, tea, coffee, supplements and more over the past several years. Beverage formulations have produced cannabinoid water-based products including de-alcoholized beer that mask unwanted cannabis flavor and are fast acting. Chocolate formulations were reported as being the fastest acting, most consistent, and best-tasting products relative to comparator control formulations in approximately 70% of cases in a recent 2017 consumer study. As well, on March 22, 2016, Lexaria announced results from another chocolate formulation consumer study in which test subjects ranked those chocolates that had been created with Lexaria’s technology as the best tasting, most palatable and providing the best overall experience of the chocolates sampled. Furthermore, the test subjects in that study indicated a time of onset of the cannabis oil effects in as little as 15-20 minutes on average. The study included 12 volunteers who were all regular cannabis consumers with experience ingesting conventional edibles. All chocolates used in the study were blinded (unmarked) in order that the subjects could not discern the product formulations applied.
 
Technology out-licensing
 
On May 14, 2016, the Company entered into a Licensing Agreement with Nuka Enterprises, LLC for a two-year period, to utilize the Company’s technology to create, test, manufacture, and sell marijuana-infused consumable and/or topical products, in the state of Colorado, with an option of extending the terms of the Licensing Agreement to Washington, Oregon, and California. On April 30, 2018, the Company announced a new 10-year renewal licensing agreement with Nuka Enterprises LLC, maker of 1906 brand cannabis chocolates and other edible products. The new agreement provides Nuka Enterprises LLC with semi-exclusive ability to utilize the DehydraTECHTM technology across the US. Nuka also acquired an option to expand its products and brand to Canada, including using Lexaria’s existing chocolate and confections contract manufacturer licensee Cannfections Group Inc. The agreement incorporates new rights in product categories in addition to the original chocolate formats, which include candies, beverages, capsules and pills, and topical creams. 
 
On January 25, 2018, the Company announced it entered a definitive technology licensing agreement with a 7-year term with Cannfections Group Inc. whereby Lexaria is providing its patented DehydraTECHTM technology to empower next-generation performance in cannabis infused chocolates and candies to be developed and sold in Canada and internationally.
 
On February 26, 2018 the Company announced it entered an agreement with NeutriSci International Inc. (“NeutriSci”) (TSX-V: NU, OTCQB: NRXCF) such that NeutriSci now owns 100% of Ambarii Trade Corporation and Lexaria has granted to NeutriSci an Intellectual Property License and Supply Agreement for the manufacturing and sale of CBD based products.
 
On February 27, 2018 the Company announced it entered a definitive technology licensing agreement with Los Angeles-based, privately-held Biolog, Inc. (“Biolog”) for a 5-year term whereby Lexaria provided its patented DehydraTECHTM technology to empower a unique set of next-generation food and beverage cannabis infusion products to be sold in the United States.
 
On April 25, 2018, the Company announced that it entered a definitive technology licensing agreement with GP Holdings LLC, (“GP”) whereby Lexaria provided its patented DehydraTECHTM technology for cannabis infused beverages and topical skin products in California. GP acquired a 5-year semi-exclusive right. Subsequent to year end, on September 28, 2018, the Company cancelled the contract due to ongoing delays and non-performance.
 


17

 
On July 31, 2018, the Company announced, and Hill Street Beverage Company Inc., (TSXV:BEER; “Hill Street”) jointly announced that they signed a Definitive Agreement to license Lexaria’s DehydraTECHTM, on a semi-exclusive basis, for a term of five (5) years, to produce a line of cannabis-infused alcohol-free beverages for Canadian distribution, following regulatory approval. 
 
The continuation of our business interests in these sectors is dependent upon obtaining further financing, a successful programs of development, and, ultimately, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.
 
We are not yet profitable and have not yet demonstrated our ability to generate significant revenues from our business plan. We will require additional corporate funds if our existing capital is not sufficient to support the Company until potential future profitability is reached. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our long-term operations. We do not expect to require additional operating capital during our fiscal 2019 year, but do expect to require capital in order to establish our own, federally licensed Canadian laboratory on-premises for our internal R&D purposes. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other longer-term obligations as they become due. In such event, we could be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations. There is uncertainty as to whether we can obtain additional long-term financing if we do in fact require it.
 
Our business plan anticipates that we will hire three to six employees and that we will require new office space in order to facilitate a federally licensed Canadian laboratory on-premises for our internal R&D purposes. We expect to be able to utilize contracted third parties for most of our production and distribution needs, instead focusing our capital on higher value added aspects of the business such as research and development, and scientific testing. We have no current plans to build our own production facility.
 
Our company relies on the business experience of our existing management, on the technical abilities of consulting experts, and on the technical and operational abilities of its operating partner companies to evaluate business opportunities.
 
Competition
 
The legal marijuana industry is comprised of several sub-sectors, and is legal under different guidelines in many states though it remains illegal under most federal laws. Notwithstanding, the overall sector is generally recognized to be one of the fastest growing in the USA, with state-legal revenue of over $8 billion in 2016. Independent projections and publicized reports expect revenue of $20 billion or more in 2020 and as much as $100 billion or more in 2025 both as the sector gains in credibility and acceptance, and as more and more states legalize either medical use or adult recreational use; or both. In any fast growing industry, competition is expected to be both strong and also difficult to evaluate as to the most effective competitive threats. While we are an early adopter within the cannabinoid delivery sector, there are already reports of more than 300 public companies that have claimed to be involved in the sector in some fashion; and an unknown number of private companies. Our current strategies may prove to be ineffective as the sector grows and matures, and if so, we will have to adapt quickly to changing sectoral circumstances. Accordingly, the Company intends to aggressively pursue technology out-licensing opportunities not only within the cannabinoids sector where it is already active, but also across other sectors where its DehydraTECHTM technology is patent allowed and/or pending, including the opportunities in the vitamin and supplements sector, the pain relief sector and the nicotine products sector.

Competition in alternative health sectors and in consumer products in the USA is fierce. We expect to encounter competitive threats from existing participants in the sector and new entrants. Although PoViva Tea LLC has filed patent applications to protect intellectual property, there is no assurance that patents beyond those already issued will be granted nor that other firms may not file superior patents pending. Food supplements, organic foods, and health food markets are all well established and our Company will face many challenges trying to enter these markets. Lexaria is also aware of various competing technologies that exist in the marketplace that claim to also enhance the bioabsorption of cannabinoids as Lexaria has demonstrated through repeated in vitro and in vivo scientific testing with its patented DehydraTECHTM technology. By and large, these technologies are all forms of nanotechnology that generally claim to enable the formation of microencapsulated and/or microemulsions of cannabinoid active ingredients, although additional technologies are also beginning to emerge in the cannabinoid sector including transgenic synthesis means to generate cannabinoid molecules with enhanced hydrophilicity. These technologies can enable exceptional water solubility of cannabinoid ingredients and can impart improved intestinal bioabsorption as a result. However, it is Lexaria’s belief that its patented DehydraTECHTM technology offers a host of benefits beyond what competing technologies can offer, including superior oral palatability, a more appealing and all-natural ingredient compositional profile from a food and beverage formulation perspective and superior scalability and cost effectiveness from a manufacturing perspective. Lexaria believes that its DehydraTECHTM technology is, therefore, significantly distinguished from competing technologies in these respects, with a view to growing the breadth and number of licensees that will adopt its technology for their product offerings going forward. Lexaria believes that these competitive advantages together with its wealth of scientific data showing noteworthy bioabsorption enhancements with its DehydraTECHTM technology constitute a compelling value proposition for its prospective licensees, and it intends to continue to pursue license arrangements not only within the cannabinoids edibles sector where it is already active, but also in the various other bioactive ingredient sectors identified in its issued and pending patent applications.
 
Compliance with Government Regulation 
 
Over 30 States in the USA have passed some form of legislation related to that state’s permission to grow, cultivate, sell or use marijuana either for medical purposes or for recreational or “adult use” purposes; or both. The various state legislation is not necessarily harmonious with one another, leading to potential conflicts between state laws. It is most often not legal to transport cannabis-related products across state lines.
 
Lexaria does not “touch the plant” in any location within or outside of the USA. We comply with federal law that provides for certain exemptions for agricultural (industrial) hemp and certain byproducts to be manufactured and sold in the US. The DehydraTECHTM technology may have applications within the legal marijuana sector and we may seek to license that technology to companies that have met and comply with state regulations for the sale or distribution of cannabis related products in any particular jurisdiction. 
 
Lexaria’s position is that, just as a telephone company provides communications services, and an electric company provides electrical power, our provision of technological services to a state-legal cannabis company is in compliance with laws and required regulations.
 
Lexaria’s patented DehydraTECHTM technology may also have application in completely separate sectors such as vitamins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, and nicotine. We have no products nor operations in any of these sectors today, although we have commenced formulation development for research and validation purposes in each of these areas. If we enter any of these sectors at any time, we will be exposed to and of necessity will have to comply with, all local, state and federal regulations in each of those sectors. As a result of the possibility of Lexaria being involved in a number of disparate business sectors, compliance with government regulations could require significant resources and expertise from our company. 
 
Lexaria’s corporate offices are located in Canada. Canada has passed federal legislation that currently allows legal medical-purposed cannabis. On October 17, 2018 Canada enacted federal legislation that allows, recreationally-purposed cannabis for personal use, with edible regulations expected within 12 months. Cannabis possession – in regulated quantities – by any person older than 18 is now legal in Canada. Lexaria complies with all Canadian legislation related to Cannabis and other controlled substances.
 
Enertopia Joint Venture
 
On May 28, 2014, our company and Enertopia Corp. entered into a definitive agreement to develop a joint business for the production, manufacture, propagation, import/export, testing, research and development of marijuana in the Province of Ontario under the MMPR. 

19

 
On June 26, 2015, we signed a Definitive agreement to sell our interest in the Burlington joint venture along with the MMPR application number 10MMPR0610. The Burlington MMPR license application will continue in the application process under new ownership. Pursuant to the agreement, the joint venture received a non-refundable $10,000 deposit and is entitled to receive up to $1,500,000 in milestone payments upon the Burlington facility becoming licensed under the MMPR. These monies would be split 51% to Enertopia and 49% to Lexaria. The Enertopia and Lexaria Master Joint Venture Agreement entered into on March 5, 2014 still governs the relationship between the Company and Enertopia. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not expect the grant of a production license for the Burlington facility. There is no assurance that any monies will in fact ever be received from our sale of the license application. 
 
Marijuana Production in the United States
 
In the United States it is still illegal under federal law to grow, cultivate and sell medical or adult use marijuana. However approximately twenty-nine states have approved medical marijuana for use and at least eight states have approved adult use regulations. The United States Federal government justice department has released memos that will respect the individual states where strict guidelines are followed and enforced so that the health, safety and security are protected at all times by state authorities but there is no assurance that federal laws will not at any time be more vigorously enforced. If the individual state framework fails to protect the public the Federal government will act in enforcing the controlled substances act of 1970 and the DEA will enforce the federal law.
 
As at the date of this document, our company has not entered into any prospective or definitive arrangements to produce or distribute marijuana products in the United States and has no intention of engaging in such marijuana related activities in the United States. However, our company continually reviews opportunities and monitors legal and regulatory developments related the medical marijuana sector in both Canada and the United States. We anticipate that we may re-evaluate our participation in the United States medical marijuana sector in the event that medical marijuana production becomes federally sanctioned and, in the meantime, we plan to limit our foray into the marijuana industry to ancillary involvement based on out-licensing of our DehydraTECHTM technology to state licensed producers. 
 
On November 8 2016 referendums held in various US states increased those areas in the USA where either medical or recreational use marijuana was state-legal. More than 50% of the US population now lives in a state where either medical or recreational marijuana use is permitted by state law, although it is still banned by US federal laws.
 
Significant Acquisitions and Dispositions 
 
We are planning to lease a new head-office location in Kelowna, Canada, that will include the purchase of office equipment, furniture, computers, and communications systems subject to permit approvals. We are also planning for the construction of a federal licensed Canadian laboratory on-premises for our internal R&D purposes. As of August 31, 2018 a suitable location has been identified and final permitting and approval was in process. Costs are not known at this time but could amount to $300,000 - $600,000. Subsequent to August 31, 2018, permit approvals were received and quotes were in process for construction, equipment and other requirements. 
Contractors
 
We primarily use sub-contractors and consultants in the intellectual property development and licensing, and alternative health product sectors. We primarily engage with consultants to serve our executive needs.

We are planning an increase in the number of personnel over the next 12 month period to enhance capacity and, subject to regulatory approval of the lab facility, for R&D purposes. We do and will continue to outsource contract employment as needed. Additional capacity may be required with product advancement or retail acceptance of our new products, we may need to retain additional personnel particularly in the fields of product manufacturing, development, sales and distribution. It is not possible to accurately project potential needs into the future based on circumstances that may or may not occur.
 
Research and Development
 
Lexaria incurred $492,864 (2017 $54,185) in research and development expenditures over the last fiscal year. With the successful financing efforts during fiscal 2017, the Company announced a $1 million budget to conduct research and development and additional scientific testing. Delays outside of our control shifted the timing of some of the research programs planned, however they are in progress and expansion into other molecules, such as Nicotine, were advanced during the year based on results from testing performed and the additional patents that were filed and granted. Specific R&D programs are in ongoing development and will be tightly related to our financial ability to undertake each research phase for each molecule. Due to our expanding portfolio coverage, we are continuing to examine accelerated timetable options for testing, research and development. 
 
The Company’s plans to include in vitro absorption tests of our patented technology of molecules such as: Vitamin E, Ibuprofen, and Nicotine allowed us to perform testing on Nicotine with positive results. Our plan to conduct our first ever in vivo absorption tests on CBD also yielded positive results. Ongoing testing plans are proceeding to further define molecular compatibility, absorption rates, timing and viable formats of delivery. 
 
Depending on how many of these tests are undertaken, it could require budgets of as much as $1,000,000, or as little as $65,000, to do so. It is in our best interests to remain flexible at this early stage of our R&D efforts in order to capitalize on potential novel findings from early-stage tests and thus re-direct research into specific avenues that offer the most reward.
 
Subsidiaries
 
Lexaria has one wholly owned Canadian corporate subsidiary, Lexaria CanPharm Corp., and three Delaware subsidiaries Lexaria Hemp Corp., Lexaria Nicotine Corp. and Lexaria Pharma Corp. We also have a 100%-owned (as of October 2017) subsidiary Poviva Tea, LLC which was incorporated on December 12, 2014, under the laws of the State of Nevada that has been converted into a corporation subsequent to August 31, 2018.
