Item 1.  Business.
Organization 
We are a Maryland corporation incorporated on October 10, 2006. We currently operate as a closed-end, non-diversified investment company and have elected to be treated as a business development company ("BDC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). We have elected for federal income tax purposes to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company ("RIC") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for tax purposes.
Our headquarters are in Charlotte, North Carolina, and our Internet address is www.baringsbdc.com. We are not including the information contained on our website as a part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available free of charge through our website our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Copies of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports are also available without charge upon written request to us.
The Asset Sale and Externalization Transactions
In April 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"), with BSP Asset Acquisition I, LLC (the "Asset Buyer"), an affiliate of Benefit Street Partners L.L.C., pursuant to which we agreed to sell our December 31, 2017 investment portfolio to the Asset Buyer for gross proceeds of $981.2 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments to take into account portfolio activity and other matters occurring since December 31, 2017 (such transaction referred to herein as the "Asset Sale Transaction"). Also in April 2018, we entered into a stock purchase and transaction agreement (the "Externalization Agreement"), with Barings LLC ("Barings") through which Barings agreed to become our investment adviser in exchange for (1) a payment by Barings of $85.0 million, or approximately $1.78 per share, directly to our stockholders, (2) an investment by Barings of $100.0 million in newly issued shares of our common stock at net asset value and (3) a commitment from Barings to purchase up to $50.0 million of shares of our common stock in the open market at prices up to and including our then-current net asset value per share for a two-year period, after which Barings agreed to use any remaining funds from the $50.0 million to purchase additional newly-issued shares of our common stock at the greater of our then-current net asset value per share or market price (collectively, the "Externalization Transaction"). The Asset Sale Transaction and the Externalization Transaction are collectively referred to as the "Transactions." The Transactions were approved by our stockholders at our July 24, 2018 special meeting of stockholders (the "2018 Special Meeting"). 
The Externalization Transaction closed on August 2, 2018 (the "Externalization Closing"). Effective as of the Externalization Closing, we changed our name from Triangle Capital Corporation to Barings BDC, Inc. and on August 3, 2018, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "BBDC."
Our former wholly-owned subsidiaries, Triangle Mezzanine Fund LLLP ("Triangle SBIC"), Triangle Mezzanine Fund II LP ("Triangle SBIC II"), and Triangle Mezzanine Fund III LP ("Triangle SBIC III"), were specialty finance limited partnerships that were formed to make investments primarily in lower middle-market companies located throughout the United States. Each of Triangle SBIC, Triangle SBIC II and Triangle SBIC III held licenses to operate as Small Business Investment Companies ("SBICs"), under the authority of the United States Small Business Administration ("SBA"). In connection with the closing of the Asset Sale Transaction, we repaid all of our outstanding SBA-guaranteed debentures and surrendered the SBIC licenses held by Triangle SBIC, Triangle SBIC II, and Triangle SBIC III. Triangle SBIC, Triangle SBIC II, and Triangle SBIC III were dissolved during the year ended December 31, 2019. 
Prior to the Externalization Transaction, we were internally managed by our executive officers under the supervision of our Board of Directors (the "Board"). During this period, we did not pay management or advisory fees, but instead incurred the operating costs associated with employing executive management and investment and portfolio management professionals. In connection with the closing of the Externalization Transaction, we entered 
4


into an investment advisory agreement (the "Original Advisory Agreement") and an administration agreement (the "Administration Agreement") with Barings, pursuant to which Barings serves as our investment adviser and administrator and manages our investment portfolio which initially consisted primarily of the cash proceeds received in connection with the Asset Sale Transaction.
MVC Capital, Inc. Acquisition 
On December 23, 2020, we completed our acquisition of MVC Capital, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“MVC”) (the “MVC Acquisition”) pursuant to the terms and conditions of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “MVC Merger Agreement”), dated as of August 10, 2020, with MVC, Mustang Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary (“Acquisition Sub”), and Barings. To effect the acquisition, Acquisition Sub merged with and into MVC, with MVC surviving the merger as our wholly owned subsidiary (the “First MVC Merger”). Immediately thereafter, MVC merged with and into us, with us as the surviving company (the “Second MVC Merger” and, together with the First MVC Merger, the “MVC Merger”). 
Pursuant to the MVC Merger Agreement, MVC stockholders received the right to the following merger consideration in exchange for each share of MVC common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First MVC Merger (other than shares of MVC common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First MVC Merger that were held by a subsidiary of MVC or held, directly or indirectly, by us or the Acquisition Sub), in accordance with the MVC Merger Agreement: (i) an amount in cash from Barings, without interest, equal to $0.39492, and (ii) 0.9790836 shares of our common stock, which ratio gave effect to the Euro-dollar exchange rate adjustment mechanism in the MVC Merger Agreement, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. We issued approximately 17,354,332 shares of our common stock to MVC’s then-existing stockholders in connection with the MVC Merger, thereby resulting in our then-existing stockholders owning approximately 73.4% of the combined company and MVC's then-existing stockholders owning approximately 26.6% of the combined company.
In connection with the closing of the MVC Merger, the Board affirmed our commitment to open-market purchases of shares of our common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $15.0 million at then-current market prices at any time shares trade below 90% of our then most recently disclosed net asset value per share. Any repurchases pursuant to the authorized program will occur during the 12-month period that commenced upon the filing of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, which occurred on May 6, 2021, and will be made in accordance with applicable legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, including covenants under our $875.0 million senior secured credit facility with ING Capital LLC initially entered into in February 2019 (as amended, restated and otherwise modified from time to time, the "February 2019 Credit Facility"). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not repurchase any shares under the authorized program. 
In connection with the MVC Acquisition, on December 23, 2020, following the closing of the MVC Merger, we entered into an amended and restated investment advisory agreement (the “Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement”) with Barings, effective January 1, 2021, which amended the Original Advisory Agreement to, among other things, (i) reduce the annual base management fee payable to Barings from 1.375% to 1.250% of our gross assets, (ii) reset the commencement date for the rolling 12-quarter “look-back” provision used to calculate the income incentive fee and incentive fee cap to January 1, 2021 from January 1, 2020 and (iii) describe the fact that we may enter into guarantees, sureties and other credit support arrangements with respect to one or more of our investments, including the impact of these arrangements on the income incentive fee cap. See “—Management Agreements – Investment Advisory Agreement” in this Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
In connection with the MVC Acquisition, on December 23, 2020, promptly following the closing of the MVC Merger, we entered into a Credit Support Agreement (the “MVC Credit Support Agreement”) with Barings, pursuant to which Barings has agreed to provide credit support to us in the amount of up to $23.0 million relating to the net cumulative realized and unrealized losses on the acquired MVC investment portfolio over a 10-year period. The MVC Credit Support Agreement is intended to give stockholders of the combined company downside protection from net cumulative realized and unrealized losses on the acquired MVC portfolio and insulate the combined company’s stockholders from potential value volatility and losses in MVC’s portfolio following the 
5


closing of the MVC Merger. There is no fee or other payment by us to Barings or any of its affiliates in connection with the MVC Credit Support Agreement. Any cash payment from Barings to us under the MVC Credit Support Agreement will be excluded from the incentive fee calculations under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement. See “Note 2. Agreements and Related Party Transactions” and “Note. 6 Derivative Instruments” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Pending Sierra Income Corporation Acquisition 
On September 21, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Sierra Merger Agreement”) by and among us, Mercury Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation and our direct wholly owned subsidiary (“Sierra Acquisition Sub”), Sierra Income Corporation, a Maryland corporation (“Sierra”), and Barings. The Sierra Merger Agreement provides that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Sierra Merger Agreement, Sierra Acquisition Sub will merge with and into Sierra, with Sierra continuing as the surviving company and as our wholly owned subsidiary (the “First Sierra Merger”) and, immediately thereafter, Sierra will merge with and into us, with Barings BDC, Inc. continuing as the surviving company (the “Second Sierra Merger” and, together with the First Sierra Merger, the “Sierra Merger”). Both the Board and the board of directors of Sierra, including all of the respective independent directors, have approved the Sierra Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein. The parties to the Sierra Merger Agreement intend the Sierra Merger to be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
In the First Sierra Merger, each share of Sierra common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First Sierra Merger (excluding any shares cancelled pursuant to the Sierra Merger Agreement) will be converted into the right to receive (i) $0.9783641 per share in cash, without interest, from Barings (such amount of cash, the “Sierra Cash Consideration”) and (ii) 0.44973 (such ratio, as may be adjusted pursuant to the Sierra Merger Agreement, the “Sierra Exchange Ratio”) of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of our common stock (the “Sierra Share Consideration” and, together with the Sierra Cash Consideration, the “Sierra Merger Consideration”).
The Sierra Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to the operation of each of our and Sierra’s businesses during the period prior to the closing of the Sierra Merger. We and Sierra have agreed to convene and hold stockholder meetings for the purpose of obtaining the approvals required of our and Sierra’s stockholders, respectively, and our Board and the board of directors of Sierra have agreed to recommend that their respective stockholders approve the applicable proposals (as described below).
The Sierra Merger Agreement provides that Sierra shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries and instruct its representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit proposals relating to alternative transactions, or, subject to certain exceptions, initiate or participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide information with respect to, any proposal for an alternative transaction. However, the Sierra board of directors may, subject to certain conditions, change its recommendation to the Sierra stockholders or, on payment of a termination fee of $11.0 million to us and the reimbursement of up to $2.0 million in expenses incurred by us and Barings, terminate the Sierra Merger Agreement and enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement (as defined in the Sierra Merger Agreement) for a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Sierra Merger Agreement) if it determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors’ duties under applicable law.
Consummation of the First Sierra Merger, which is currently anticipated to occur during the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including (1) approval of the First Sierra Merger by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Sierra common stock entitled to vote thereon, (2) approval of the issuance of our common stock to be issued in the First Sierra Merger by a majority of the votes cast by our stockholders on the matter at our stockholders meeting, (3) approval of the issuance of our common stock in connection with the First Sierra Merger at a price below the then-current net asset value per share of our common stock, if applicable, by the vote specified in Section 63(2)(A) of the 1940 Act, (4) the absence of certain legal impediments to the consummation of the Sierra Merger, (5) effectiveness of the registration statement for our common stock to be issued as consideration in the First Sierra Merger, (6) approval for listing on the NYSE of our common stock to be issued as consideration in the First Sierra Merger, (7) subject to certain materiality standards, 
6


the accuracy of the representations and warranties and compliance with the covenants of each party to the Sierra Merger Agreement, and (8) required regulatory approvals (including expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or early termination thereof).
Barings, as party to the Sierra Merger Agreement, agreed to vote all shares of our common stock over which it has voting power (other than in its fiduciary capacity) in favor of the proposals to be submitted by us to our stockholders for approval relating to the Sierra Merger.
In addition, we and Sierra will take steps necessary to provide for the repayment at closing of Sierra’s existing loan agreement. The Sierra Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights in favor of us and Sierra, including if the First Sierra Merger is not completed on or before March 31, 2022 or if the requisite approvals of our stockholders or Sierra stockholders are not obtained.
Further, we will enter into an amendment and restatement of the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, effective as of the closing of the Sierra Merger, to raise the annualized hurdle rate thereunder from 8.0% to 8.25%. Following the closing of the Sierra Merger, we will also enter into a credit support agreement with Barings, for the benefit of the combined company, to protect against net cumulative unrealized and realized losses of up to $100.0 million on the acquired Sierra investment portfolio over the next ten years. 
Overview of Our Business
Beginning in August 2018, Barings shifted our investment focus to invest in syndicated senior secured loans, bonds and other fixed income securities. Since that time, Barings has transitioned our portfolio to primarily senior secured private debt investments in well-established middle-market businesses that operate across a wide range of industries. Barings’ existing SEC co-investment exemptive relief under the 1940 Act (the "Exemptive Relief") permits us and Barings’ affiliated private and SEC-registered funds to co-invest in Barings-originated loans, which allows Barings to efficiently implement its senior secured private debt investment strategy for us. 
Barings employs fundamental credit analysis, and targets investments in businesses with relatively low levels of cyclicality and operating risk. The hold size of each position will generally be dependent upon a number of factors including total facility size, pricing and structure, and the number of other lenders in the facility. Barings has experience managing levered vehicles, both public and private, and will seek to enhance our returns through the use of leverage with a prudent approach that prioritizes capital preservation. Barings believes this strategy and approach offers attractive risk/return with lower volatility given the potential for fewer defaults and greater resilience through market cycles. 
Our investment objective is to generate current income by investing directly in privately-held middle-market companies to help these companies fund acquisitions, growth or refinancing. Barings employs fundamental credit analysis, and targets investments in businesses with low levels of cyclicality (i.e., the risk of business cycles or other economic cycles adversely affecting them) and operating risk relative to other businesses in this market segment. The holding size of each position will generally be dependent upon a number of factors including total facility size, pricing and structure, and the number of other lenders in the facility. Barings has experience managing levered vehicles, both public and private, and seeks to enhance our returns through the use of leverage with a prudent approach that prioritizes capital preservation. Barings believes this strategy and approach offers attractive risk/return with lower volatility given the potential for fewer defaults and greater resilience through market cycles. A significant portion of our investments are expected to be rated below investment grade by rating agencies or, if unrated, would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as “junk,” have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. To a lesser extent, we may make investments in syndicated loan opportunities for cash management and other purposes, which includes but is not limited to maintaining more liquid investments to manage our share repurchase program.

Relationship with Our Adviser, Barings
Our investment adviser, Barings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, is a leading global asset management firm and is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"). Barings’ primary investment capabilities include fixed income, private credit, real estate, equity, and alternative investments. Subject to the overall supervision of the Board, Barings’ Global Private Finance Group ("Barings GPFG"), manages our day-to-day operations, and provides investment advisory and management services to us. Barings GPFG is part of Barings' $305.2 billion Global Fixed Income Platform that invests in liquid, private and structured credit. Barings GPFG manages private funds and separately managed accounts, along with multiple public vehicles. 
Among other things, Barings (i) determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes therein and the manner of implementing such changes; (ii) identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments made by us; (iii) executes, closes, services and monitors the investments that we make; (iv) determines the securities and other assets that we will purchase, retain or sell; (v) performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and (vi) provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds.
Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, Barings performs (or oversees, or arranges for, the performance of) the administrative services necessary for our operation, including, but not limited to, office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such office facilities and such other services as Barings, subject to review by the Board, will from time to time determine to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement. Barings also, on our behalf and subject to the Board’s oversight, arranges for the services of, and oversees, custodians, depositories, transfer agents, dividend disbursing agents, other stockholder servicing agents, accountants, attorneys, underwriters, brokers and dealers, corporate fiduciaries, insurers, banks and such other persons in any such other capacity deemed to be necessary or desirable. Barings is responsible for the financial and other records that we are required to maintain and will prepare all reports and other materials required to be filed with the SEC or any other regulatory authority.
Stockholder Approval of Reduced Asset Coverage Ratio
On July 24, 2018, our stockholders voted at the 2018 Special Meeting to approve a proposal to authorize us to be subject to a reduced asset coverage ratio of at least 150% under the 1940 Act. As a result of the stockholder approval at the 2018 Special Meeting, effective July 25, 2018, our applicable asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act has been decreased to 150% from 200%. As a result, we are permitted under the 1940 Act to incur indebtedness at a level that is more consistent with a portfolio of senior secured debt. As of December 31, 2021, our asset coverage ratio was 153.8%.
Our Business Strategy
We seek attractive returns by generating current income primarily from directly-originated debt investments in middle-market companies located primarily in the United States. We also have investments in middle-market companies located outside the United States. Our strategy includes the following components: 
•Leveraging Barings GPFG's Origination and Portfolio Management Resources.  Barings GPFG has over 75 investment professionals located in six different offices in the U.S., Europe, Australia/New Zealand and Asia. These regional investment teams have been working together in their respective regions for a number of years and have extensive experience advising, investing in and lending to companies across changing market cycles. In addition, the individual members of these teams have diverse investment backgrounds, with prior experience at investment banks, commercial banks, and privately and publicly held companies. We believe this diverse experience provides an in-depth understanding of the strategic, financial and operational challenges and opportunities of middle-market companies.
•Utilizing Long-Standing Relationships to Source Investments.    Barings GPFG has worked diligently over decades to build strategic relationships with private equity firms globally. Barings GPFG's long history of providing consistent, predictable capital to middle-market sponsors, even in periods of market dislocation, 
8


has earned Barings and us a reputation as a reliable partner. Barings GPFG also maintains extensive personal relationships with entrepreneurs, financial sponsors, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, commercial bankers and other non-bank providers of capital who refer prospective portfolio companies to us. These relationships historically have generated significant investment opportunities. We believe that this network of relationships will continue to produce attractive investment opportunities. 
•Focusing on the Middle-Market. We primarily invest in middle-market transactions. These companies tend to be privately owned, often by a private equity sponsor, and are companies that typically generate annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), of $10.0 million to $75.0 million. 
•Providing One-Stop Customized Financing Solutions.    Barings GPFG's ability to commit to and originate larger hold positions (in excess of $200 million) in a given transaction is a differentiator to middle-market private equity sponsors. In today's market, it has become increasingly important to have the ability to underwrite an entire transaction, providing financial sponsors with certainty of close. Barings GPFG offers a variety of financing structures and has the flexibility to structure investments to meet the needs of our portfolio companies. 
•Applying Consistent Underwriting Policies and Active Portfolio Management.    We believe robust due diligence on each investment is paramount due to the lack of an active secondary market. With limited ability to liquidate holdings, private credit investors must take a longer-term, “originate-to-hold” investment approach. Barings GPFG has implemented underwriting policies and procedures that are followed for each potential transaction. This consistent and proven fundamental underwriting process includes a thorough analysis of each potential portfolio company’s competitive position, financial performance, management team operating discipline, growth potential and industry attractiveness, which Barings GPFG believes allows it to better assess the company’s prospects. After closing, Barings GPFG maintains ongoing access to both the sponsor and portfolio company management in order to closely monitor investments and suggest or require remedial actions as needed to avoid a default. 
•Maintaining Portfolio Diversification.    While we focus our investments in middle-market companies, we seek to invest across various industries and in both United States-based and foreign-based companies. Barings GPFG monitors our investment portfolio to ensure we have acceptable industry balance, using industry and market metrics as key indicators. By monitoring our investment portfolio for industry balance, we seek to reduce the effects of economic downturns associated with any particular industry or market sector. Notwithstanding our intent to invest across a variety of industries, we may from time to time hold securities of a single portfolio company that comprise more than 5.0% of our total assets and/or more than 10.0% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company. For that reason, we are classified as a non-diversified management investment company under the 1940 Act.
Investments
Debt Investments
The terms of our debt investments are tailored to the facts and circumstances of each transaction and prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that seeks to protect lender rights and manage risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan. We also seek to limit the downside risks of our investments by negotiating covenants that are designed to protect our investments while affording our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protections, change of control provisions, put rights and a pledge of the operating companies' stock which provides us with additional exit options in downside scenarios. Other lending protections may include term loan amortization, excess cash flow sweeps (effectively additional term loan amortization), limitations on a company’s ability to make acquisitions, maximums on capital expenditures and limits on allowable dividends and distributions. Further, up-front closing fees of typically 1-3% of the loan amount act effectively as pre-payment protection given the cost to a company to refinance early. Additionally, we will typically include call protection provisions effective for the first six to twelve months of an investment to enhance our potential total return.

We invest in predominately senior secured private debt investments in, well-established middle-market businesses that operate across a wide range of industries. We currently invest primarily in loans that have terms of between five and seven years, and bear interest at rates ranging from LIBOR (or an applicable successor rate) plus 450 basis points to LIBOR plus 650 basis points per annum.
Equity Investments
On a limited basis, we may acquire equity interests in portfolio companies. In such cases, we generally seek to structure our equity investments as non-control investments that provide us with minority rights.
Investment Criteria
We utilize the following criteria and guidelines in evaluating investment opportunities. However, not all of these criteria and guidelines have been, or will be, met in connection with each of our investments.
•Established Companies With Positive Cash Flow.    We seek to invest in later-stage or mature companies with a proven history of generating positive cash flows. We typically focus on companies with a history of profitability and trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA ranging from $10.0 million to $75.0 million. 
•Experienced Management Teams.    Based on our prior investment experience, we believe that a management team with significant experience with a portfolio company or relevant industry experience is essential to the long-term success of the portfolio company. We believe management teams with these attributes are more likely to manage the companies in a manner that protects our debt investment.
•Strong Competitive Position.    We seek to invest in companies that have developed strong positions within their respective markets, are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities and compete in industries with barriers to entry. We also seek to invest in companies that exhibit a competitive advantage, which may help to protect their market position and profitability.
•Varied Customer and Supplier Bases.    We prefer to invest in companies that have varied customer and supplier bases. Companies with varied customer and supplier bases are generally better able to endure economic downturns, industry consolidation and shifting customer preferences.
•Significant Invested Capital.    We believe the existence of significant underlying equity value provides important support to investments. We seek to identify portfolio companies that we believe have well-structured capital beyond the layer of the capital structure in which we invest.
Investment Process
Our investment origination and portfolio monitoring activities are performed by Barings GPFG. Barings GPFG has an investment committee that is responsible for all aspects of the investment process. The investment process is designed to maximize risk-adjusted returns, minimize non-performing assets and avoid investment losses. In addition, the investment process is also designed to provide sponsors and prospective portfolio companies with efficient and predictable deal execution.
10


Origination
Our origination process is summarized in the following chart:
Investment Pre-Screen
The investment pre-screen process begins with a review of an offering memorandum or other high-level prospect information by an investment originator. A fundamental bottoms-up credit analysis is prepared and independent third-party research is gathered in addition to the information received from the sponsor. The investment group focuses on a prospective investment's fundamentals, sponsor/source and proposed investment structure. This review may be followed by a discussion between the investment originator and an investment group head to identify investment opportunities that should be passed on, either because they fall outside of Barings GPFG's stated investment strategy or offer an unacceptable risk-adjusted return. If the originator and investment group head agree that an investment opportunity is worth pursuing, a credit analyst assists the originator with preparation of a screening memorandum. The screening memorandum is discussed internally with the investment group head and other senior members of the investment group, and in certain instances, the investment group head may elect to review the screening memorandum with the investment committee prior to the preliminary investment proposal.
Preliminary Investment Proposal
Following the screening memorandum discussion, if the decision is made by the investment group head to pursue an investment opportunity, key pricing and structure terms may be communicated to the prospective borrower verbally or via a non-binding standard preliminary term sheet in order to determine whether the proposed terms are competitive. 
Investment Approval
Upon acceptance by a sponsor/prospective borrower of preliminary key pricing and structure terms, the investment process continues with formal due diligence. The investment team attends meetings with the prospective portfolio company’s management, reviews historical and forecasted financial information and third-party diligence reports, conducts research to support preparation of proprietary financial models including both base case and 
11


downside scenarios, valuation analyses, and ultimately, an underwriting memorandum for review by the investment committee. A majority of the votes cast at a meeting at which a majority of the members of the Investment Committee is present is required to approve all new investment decisions.
Commitment Letter
For investments that require written confirmation of commitment, commitment letters must be approved by Barings GPFG's internal legal team. Commitment letters include customary conditions as well as any conditions specified by the investment committee. Such conditions could include, but are not limited to, specific confirmatory due diligence, minimum pre-close Adjusted EBITDA, minimum capitalization, satisfactory documentation, satisfactory legal due diligence and absence of material adverse change. Unless specified by the investment committee as a condition to approval, commitment letters need not include final investment committee approval as a condition precedent.
Documentation 
Once an investment opportunity has been approved, negotiation of definitive legal documents occurs, usually simultaneously with completion of any third-party confirmatory due diligence. Typically, legal documentation will be reviewed by Barings GPFG’s internal legal team or by outside legal counsel to ensure that our security interest can be perfected and that all other terms of the definitive loan documents are consistent with the terms approved by the investment committee. 
Closing
A closing memorandum is provided to the investment committee. The closing memorandum addresses final investment structure and pricing terms, the sources and uses of funds, any variances from the original approved terms, an update related to the prospect’s financial performance and, if warranted, updates to internal financial models. The closing memorandum also addresses each of the specific conditions to the approval of the investment by the investment committee, including results of confirmatory due diligence with any exceptions or abnormalities highlighted, and includes an analysis of financial covenants with a comparison to the financial forecast prepared by management.
Portfolio Management and Investment Monitoring
Our portfolio management and investment monitoring processes are overseen by Barings GPFG. Barings GPFG's portfolio management process is designed to maximize risk-adjusted returns and identify non-performing assets well in advance of potentially adverse events in order to mitigate investment losses. Key aspects of the Barings GPFG investment and portfolio management process include:
•Culture of Risk Management.    The investment team that approves an investment monitors the investment's performance through repayment. We believe this practice encourages accountability by connecting investment team members with the long-term performance of the investment. This also allows us to leverage the underwriting process, namely the comprehensive understanding of the risk factors associated with the investment that an investment team develops during underwriting. In addition, we foster continuous interaction between investment teams and the investment committee. This frequent communication encourages the early escalation of issues to members of the investment committee to leverage their experience and expertise well in advance of potentially adverse events. 
•Ongoing Monitoring. Each portfolio company is assigned to an analyst who is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the investment. Upon receipt of information (financial or otherwise) relating to an investment, a preliminary review is performed by the analyst in order to assess whether the information raises any issues that require increased attention. Particular consideration is given to information which may impact the value of an asset. In the event that something material is identified, the analyst is responsible for notifying the relevant members of the deal team and investment committee.
12


•Quarterly Portfolio Reviews. All investments are reviewed on at least a quarterly basis. The quarterly portfolio reviews provide a forum to evaluate the current status of each asset and identify any recent or long-term performance trends, either positive or negative, that may affect its current valuation. 
•Focus Credit List Reviews. Certain credits are deemed to be on the “Focus Credit List” and are reviewed on a more frequent basis. These reviews typically occur monthly but can occur more or less frequently based on situational factors and the availability of updated information from the company. During these reviews, the investment team provides an update on the situation and discusses potential courses of action with the investment committee to ensure any mitigating steps are taken in a timely manner.
•Sponsor Relationships. We invest primarily in transactions backed by a private equity sponsor and when evaluating investment opportunities, we take into account the strength of the sponsor (e.g., track record, sector expertise, strategy, governance, follow-on investment capacity, relationship with Barings GPFG). Having a strong relationship and staying in close contact with sponsors and management during not only the underwriting process but also throughout the life of the investment allows us to engage the sponsor and management early to address potential covenant breaks or other issues.
•Robust Investment and Portfolio Management System. Barings' investment and portfolio management system serves as the central repository of data used for investment management, including both company-level metrics (e.g., probability of default, Adjusted EBITDA, geography) and asset-level metrics (e.g., price, spread/coupon, seniority). Barings GPFG portfolio management has established a required set of data that analysts must update quarterly, or more frequently when appropriate, in order to produce a one-page summary for each company, known as tearsheets, which are used during quarterly portfolio reviews.

The most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded. We have a valuation policy, as well as established and documented processes and methodologies for determining the fair values of portfolio company investments on a recurring (at least quarterly) basis in accordance with the 1940 Act and FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC Topic 820"). Our current valuation policy and processes were established by Barings and were approved by the Board. 
Under ASC Topic 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller at the measurement date. For our portfolio securities, fair value is generally the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security. The fair value measurement assumes that the sale occurs in the principal market for the security, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the security. If no market for the security exists or if we do not have access to the principal market, the security should be valued based on the sale occurring in a hypothetical market.
Under ASC Topic 820, there are three levels of valuation inputs, as follows: 
Level 1 Inputs – include quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 Inputs – include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
Level 3 Inputs – include inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.
A financial instrument is categorized within the ASC Topic 820 valuation hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input to the valuation process that is significant to the fair value measurement. For example, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3). Therefore, unrealized appreciation and depreciation related to such investments categorized as Level 3 investments within the tables in the notes to our consolidated financial statements may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable inputs (Level 3).
13


Our investment portfolio includes certain debt and equity instruments of privately held companies for which quoted prices or other observable inputs falling within the categories of Level 1 and Level 2 are generally not available. In such cases, we determine the fair value of our investments in good faith primarily using Level 3 inputs. In certain cases, quoted prices or other observable inputs exist, and if so, we assess the appropriateness of the use of these third-party quotes in determining fair value based on (i) our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer and (ii) the depth and consistency of broker quotes and the correlation of changes in broker quotes with underlying performance of the portfolio company. 
There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith, as fair value depends upon the specific circumstances of each individual investment. The recorded fair values of our Level 3 investments may differ significantly from fair values that would have been used had an active market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned. For a discussion of the risks inherent in determining the value of securities for which readily available market values do not exist, see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — Our investment portfolio is and will continue to be recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board and, as a result, there is and will continue to be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments” included in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Investment Valuation Process 
Barings has established a pricing committee that is, subject to the oversight of the Board, responsible for the approval, implementation and oversight of the processes and methodologies that relate to the pricing and valuation of assets we hold. Barings uses independent third-party providers to price the portfolio, but in the event an acceptable price cannot be obtained from an approved external source, Barings will utilize alternative methods in accordance with internal pricing procedures established by Barings' pricing committee.
At least annually, Barings conducts reviews of the primary pricing vendors to validate that the inputs used in the vendors’ pricing process are deemed to be market observable. While Barings is not provided access to proprietary models of the vendors, the reviews have included on-site walkthroughs of the pricing process, methodologies and control procedures for each asset class and level for which prices are provided. The review also includes an examination of the underlying inputs and assumptions for a sample of individual securities across asset classes, credit rating levels and various durations, a process Barings continues to perform annually. In addition, the pricing vendors have an established challenge process in place for all security valuations, which facilitates identification and resolution of prices that fall outside expected ranges. Barings believes that the prices received from the pricing vendors are representative of prices that would be received to sell the assets at the measurement date (i.e. exit prices). 
Our money market fund investments are generally valued using Level 1 inputs and our equity investments listed on an exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market System are valued using Level 1 inputs, using the last quoted sale price of that day. Our syndicated senior secured loans and structured product investments are generally valued using Level 2 inputs, which are generally valued at the bid quotation obtained from dealers in loans by an independent pricing service. Our middle-market, private debt and equity investments are generally valued using Level 3 inputs. 
Independent Valuation 
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we engaged an independent valuation firm to provide third-party valuation consulting services at the end of each fiscal quarter, which consisted of certain limited procedures that we identified and requested the valuation firm to perform (hereinafter referred to as the "Procedures"). The Procedures generally consisted of a review of the quarterly fair values of our middle-market investments, and were generally performed with respect to each investment every quarter beginning in the quarter after the investment was made. 
Beginning with the first quarter of 2020, we revised our valuation process to require that the Procedures generally be performed with respect to each middle-market investment at least once in every calendar year and for 
14


new investments, at least once in the twelve-month period subsequent to the initial investment. In addition, the Procedures were generally performed with respect to an investment where there was a significant change in the fair value or performance of the investment.
Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2020, the fair value of loans and equity investments that are not syndicated or for which market quotations are not readily available, including middle-market loans, are generally submitted to independent providers to perform an independent valuation on those loans and equity investments as of the end of each quarter. In certain instances, we may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result is not in the stockholders' best interests, to request an independent valuation firm to perform an independent valuation on certain investments. Such instances include, but are not limited to, situations where the fair value of the investment in the portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to the total investment portfolio. Pursuant to these procedures, the Board determines in good faith whether our investments were valued at fair value in accordance with our valuation policies and procedures and the 1940 Act based on, among other things, the input of Barings, our Audit Committee and the independent valuation firm.
For a further discussion of our valuation procedures, see the section entitled “Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates — Investment Valuation” included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Valuation Techniques
Our valuation techniques are based upon both observable and unobservable pricing inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's market assumptions. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. An independent pricing service provider is the preferred source of pricing a loan, however, to the extent the independent pricing service provider price is unavailable or not relevant and reliable, we will utilize alternative approaches such as broker quotes or manual prices. We attempt to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The availability of observable inputs can vary from investment to investment and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of security, whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the security.
Valuation of Investments in Jocassee, Thompson Rivers, Waccamaw River and MVC Private Equity Fund LP
As Jocassee, Thompson Rivers, Waccamaw River and MVC Private Equity Fund LP are investment companies with no readily determinable fair values, we estimate the fair value of our investments in these entities using net asset value of each company and our ownership percentage as a practical expedient. The net asset value is determined in accordance with the specialized accounting guidance for investment companies.
Quarterly Net Asset Value Determination
We determine the net asset value per share of our common stock on at least a quarterly basis. The net asset value per share is equal to the value of our total assets minus total liabilities and any preferred stock outstanding divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding.
Exit Strategies/Refinancing
While we generally exit most investments through the refinancing or repayment of our debt, we typically assist our portfolio companies in developing and planning exit opportunities, including any sale or merger of our portfolio companies. We may also assist in the structure, timing, execution and transition of these exit strategies.
Competition
We compete for investments with a number of investment funds including public funds, private equity funds, other BDCs, as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of financing. Some of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider 
15


more investments and establish more relationships than we do. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. 
We use the expertise of the investment professionals of Barings to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. We believe the relationship we have with Barings enables us to learn about, and compete for financing opportunities with companies in middle-market businesses that operate across a wide range of industries. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see "Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses" included in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Brokerage Allocation and Other Practices
We did not pay any brokerage commissions during the three years ended December 31, 2021 in connection with the acquisition and/or disposal of our investments. We generally acquire and dispose of our investments in privately negotiated transactions; therefore, we infrequently use brokers in the normal course of our business. Barings is primarily responsible for the execution of any publicly traded securities portion of our portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage commissions. We do not expect to execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but will seek to obtain the best net results for us, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, and operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While we will generally seek reasonably competitive trade execution costs, we will not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available. Subject to applicable legal requirements, if we use a broker, we may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to us. In return for such services, we may pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if we determine in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan
We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our distributions on behalf of our common stockholders, unless a common stockholder elects to receive cash as provided below. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend, then our common stockholders who have not “opted out” of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividends.
No action will be required on the part of a registered common stockholder to have his or her cash dividend reinvested in shares of our common stock. A registered common stockholder may elect to receive an entire dividend in cash by notifying Computershare, Inc., the “Plan Administrator” and our transfer agent and registrar, in writing so that such notice is received by the Plan Administrator no later than three days prior to the payment date fixed by the Board for the dividend. The Plan Administrator will set up an account for shares acquired through the plan for each common stockholder who has not elected to receive dividends in cash and hold such shares in non-certificated form. Upon request by a common stockholder participating in the plan, received in writing not less than three days prior to the payment date, the Plan Administrator will, instead of crediting shares to the participant’s account, issue a certificate registered in the participant’s name for the number of whole shares of our common stock and a check for any fractional share. Those common stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive dividends in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election.
16


We intend to use primarily newly issued shares to implement the plan, so long as our shares are trading at or above net asset value. If our shares are trading below net asset value, we intend to purchase shares in the open market in connection with our implementation of the plan. If we use newly issued shares to implement the plan, the number of shares to be issued to a common stockholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to such common stockholder by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on the NYSE on the dividend payment date. Market price per share on that date will be the closing price for such shares on the NYSE or, if no sale is reported for such day, at the average of their reported bid and asked prices. If we purchase shares in the open market to implement the plan, the number of shares to be received by a common stockholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to such common stockholder by the average price per share for all shares purchased by the Plan Administrator in the open market in connection with the dividend. The number of shares of our common stock to be outstanding after giving effect to payment of the dividend cannot be established until the value per share at which additional shares will be issued has been determined and elections of our common stockholders have been tabulated.
There will be no brokerage charges or other charges to common stockholders who participate in the plan. However, certain brokerage firms may charge brokerage charges or other charges to their customers. We will pay the Plan Administrator’s fees under the plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Administrator to have the Plan Administrator sell part or all of the shares held by the Plan Administrator in the participant’s account and remit the proceeds to the participant, the Plan Administrator is authorized to deduct a $15.00 transaction fee plus a $0.10 per share brokerage commission from the proceeds. 
Common stockholders who receive dividends in the form of stock generally are subject to the same federal, state and local tax consequences as are common stockholders who elect to receive their dividends in cash. A common stockholder’s basis for determining gain or loss upon the sale of stock received in a dividend from us will be equal to the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to the common stockholder. Any stock received in a dividend will have a holding period for tax purposes commencing on the day following the day on which the shares are credited to the U.S. common stockholder’s account. Stock received in a dividend may generate a wash sale if such shareholder sold out stock at a realized loss within 30 days either before or after such dividend.
Participants may terminate their accounts under the plan by notifying the Plan Administrator via its website at www.computershare.com/investor, by filling out the transaction request form located at the bottom of their statement and sending it to the Plan Administrator at Computershare, Inc., P.O. Box 505000, Louisville, Kentucky 40233 or by calling the Plan Administrator at (866) 228-7201.
We may terminate the plan upon notice in writing mailed to each participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of any dividend by us. All correspondence concerning the plan should be directed to the Plan Administrator by mail at Computershare, Inc., P.O. Box 505000, Louisville, Kentucky 40233.
Employees
We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. The services necessary for our business are provided by individuals who are employees of Barings, pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Each of our executive officers is an employee of Barings and our day-to-day investment activities are managed by Barings. 
Management Agreements
On August 2, 2018, we entered into the Original Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement with Barings, an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act. Our then-current board of directors unanimously approved the Original Advisory Agreement at an in-person meeting on March 22, 2018. Our stockholders approved the Original Advisory Agreement at the 2018 Special Meeting. In connection with the MVC Acquisition, we entered into the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement on December 23, 2020, following approval of the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement by our stockholders at our December 23, 2020 special meeting of stockholders. The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement was approved on September 9, 2020 by the then-current Board, including a majority of the directors on the Board who are not “interested persons,” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of 
17


the 1940 Act, of the Company or Barings. The terms of the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement became effective on January 1, 2021.
Investment Advisory Agreement
Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, Barings manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory services. Among other things, Barings (i) determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes therein and the manner of implementing such changes; (ii) identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of our investments; (iii) executes, closes, services and monitors the investments that we make; (iv) determines the securities and other assets that we will purchase, retain or sell; (v) performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and (vi) provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of its funds.
The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement provides that, absent fraud, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, Barings, and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with Barings (collectively, the "IA Indemnified Parties"), are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs, demands, charges, claims and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) incurred by the IA Indemnified Parties in or by reason of any pending, threatened or completed action, suit, investigation or other proceeding (including an action or suit by or in the right of us or our security holders) arising out of any actions or omissions or otherwise based upon the performance of any of Barings' duties or obligations under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser. Barings' services under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and Barings is generally free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its performance under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement is not adversely affected. 
Barings has entered into a personnel-sharing arrangement with its affiliate, Baring International Investment Limited ("BIIL"). BIIL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Baring Asset Management Limited, which in turn is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Barings. Pursuant to this arrangement, certain employees of BIIL may serve as "associated persons" of Barings and, in this capacity, subject to the oversight and supervision of Barings, may provide research and related services, and discretionary investment management and trading services (including acting as portfolio managers) to us on behalf of Barings. This arrangement is based on no-action letters of the staff of the SEC that permit SEC-registered investment advisers to rely on and use the resources of advisory affiliates or "participating affiliates," subject to the supervision of that SEC-registered investment adviser. BIIL is a "participating affiliate" of Barings, and the BIIL employees are "associated persons" of Barings.
Under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, we pay Barings (i) a base management fee (the "Base Management Fee") and (ii) an incentive fee (the "Incentive Fee") as compensation for the investment advisory and management services it provides us thereunder. 
Pre-January 1, 2021 Base Management Fee
For the period from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, the Base Management Fee was calculated based on our gross assets, including the MVC Credit Support Agreement, assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage and excluding cash and cash equivalents, at an annual rate of 1.375%. The annual rate of the Base Management Fee was 1.125% for the period commencing on January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019. 
The Base Management Fee was payable quarterly in arrears on a calendar quarter basis. The Base Management Fee was calculated based on the average value of our gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters prior to the quarter for which such fees are being calculated. Base Management Fees for any partial month or quarter were appropriately pro-rated.
Post-December 31, 2020 Base Management Fee
Beginning January 1, 2021, the Base Management Fee is calculated based on our gross assets, including the MVC Credit Support Agreement, assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage and excluding cash and cash equivalents, at an annual rate of 1.25%. The Base Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears on a 
18


calendar quarter basis, and is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters prior to the quarter for which such fees are being calculated. Base Management Fees for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately pro-rated.
Pre-January 1, 2021 Incentive Fee
For the period from August 2, 2018 through December 31, 2020, under the Original Advisory Agreement, the Incentive Fee was comprised of two parts: (1) a portion based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income (the "Pre-2021 Income-Based Fee") and (2) a portion based on the net capital gains received on our portfolio of securities on a cumulative basis for each calendar year, net of all realized capital losses and all unrealized capital depreciation for that same calendar year (the "Pre-2021 Capital Gains Fee").
The Pre-2021 Income-Based Fee was calculated as follows:
(i)For each quarter from and after August 2, 2018 through December 31, 2019 (the "Pre-2020 Period"), the Pre-2021 Income-Based Fee was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter for which such fees were being calculated. In respect of the Pre-2020 Period, "Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income" meant interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence, managerial assistance and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the relevant calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for such quarter (including the Base Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income included, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income did not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.
(ii)For each quarter beginning on and after January 1, 2020 (the "Post-2019 Period"), the Pre-2021 Income-Based Fee was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (or such fewer number of preceding calendar quarters counting each calendar quarter beginning on or after January 1, 2020) (each such period referred to as the "Pre-2021 Trailing Twelve Quarters") for which such fees were being calculated and was payable promptly following the filing of the Company’s financial statements for such quarter. In respect of the Post-2019 Period, "Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income" meant interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence, managerial assistance and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the relevant Pre-2021 Trailing Twelve Quarters, minus our operating expenses for such Pre-2021 Trailing Twelve Quarters (including the Base Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee) divided by the number of quarters that comprise the relevant Pre-2021 Trailing Twelve Quarters. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income included, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income did not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.
(iii)Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined as total assets less senior securities constituting indebtedness and preferred stock) at the end of the calendar quarter for which such fees were being calculated, was compared to a "hurdle rate", expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter, of 2% per quarter (8% annualized). We paid Barings the Pre-2021 Income-Based Fee with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in each calendar quarter as follows:
19


(1)(a) With respect to the Pre-2020 Period, no Pre-2021 Income-Based Fee for any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in paragraph (i) above) did not exceed the hurdle rate;
(b) With respect to the Post-2019 Period, no Pre-2021 Income-Based Fee for any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in paragraph (ii) above) did not exceed the hurdle rate;
(2)(a) With respect to the Pre-2020 Period, 100% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in paragraph (i) above) for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such quarter, if any, that exceeded the hurdle rate but was less than 2.5% (10% annualized) (the "Pre-2020 Catch-Up Amount"). The Pre-2020 Catch-Up Amount was intended to provide Barings with an incentive fee of 20% on all of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in paragraph (i) above) when our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in paragraph (i) above) reached 2% per quarter (8% annualized);
(b) With respect to the Post-2019 Period, 100% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in paragraph (ii) above) with respect to that portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in paragraph (ii) above), if any, that exceeded the hurdle rate but was less than 2.5% (10% annualized) (the "Post-2019 Catch-Up Amount"). The Post-2019 Catch-Up Amount was intended to provide Barings with an incentive fee of 20% on all of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in paragraph (ii) above) when our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in paragraph (ii) above) reached 2% per quarter (8% annualized);
(3)(a) With respect to the Pre-2020 Period, 20% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in paragraph (i) above) for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in paragraph (i) above) for such quarter, if any, that exceeded the Pre-2020 Catch-Up Amount; and
(b) With respect to the Post-2019 Period, 20% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in paragraph (ii) above) for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined in paragraph (ii) above), if any, that exceeded the Post-2019 Catch-Up Amount.
However, with respect to the Post-2019 Period, the Pre-2021 Income-Based Fee paid to Barings would in no event be in excess of the Pre-2021 Incentive Fee Cap. With respect to the Post-2019 Period, the "Pre-2021 Incentive Fee Cap" for any quarter was an amount equal to (a) 20% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Pre-2021 Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (b) the aggregate Pre-2021 Income-Based Fee that was paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Pre-2021 Trailing Twelve Quarters.
Cumulative Net Return meant (x) the aggregate net investment income in respect of the relevant Pre-2021 Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (y) any Net Capital Loss (as defined below), if any, in respect of the relevant Pre-2021 Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Pre-2021 Incentive Fee Cap was zero or a negative value, we paid no Pre-2021 Income-Based Fee to Barings for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Pre-2021 Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter was a positive value but was less than the Pre-2021 Income-Based Fee that was payable to Barings for such quarter (before giving effect to the Pre-2021 Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, we paid a Pre-2021 Income-Based Fee to Barings equal to the Pre-2021 Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Pre-2021 Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter was equal to or greater than the Pre-2021Income-Based Fee that was payable to Barings for such quarter (before giving effect to the Pre-2021 Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, we paid a Pre-2021 Income-Based Fee to Barings equal to the Pre-2021 Income-Based Fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Pre-2021 Incentive Fee Cap. 
Net Capital Loss in respect of a particular period meant the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period.
20


The Pre-2021 Capital Gains Fee was determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year, commencing with the calendar year ended on December 31, 2018, and was calculated at the end of each applicable year by subtracting (1) the sum of our cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation from (2) our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, in each case calculated from August 2, 2018. If such amount was positive at the end of such year, then the Pre-2021 Capital Gains Fee payable for such year was equal to 20% of such amount, less the cumulative aggregate amount of Pre-2021 Capital Gains Fees paid in all prior years. If such amount was negative, then there was no Pre-2021 Capital Gains Fee payable for such year. 
Post-December 31, 2020 Incentive Fee 
Beginning January 1, 2021, the Incentive Fee continues to consist of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. Under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, a portion of the Incentive Fee is based on our income (the “ Income-Based Fee”) and a portion is based on our capital gains (the “Capital Gains Fee ”), each as described below:
(i) The Income-Based Fee will be determined and paid quarterly in arrears based on the amount by which (x) the aggregate “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” (as defined below) in respect of the current calendar quarter and the eleven preceding calendar quarters beginning with the calendar quarter that commences on or after January 1, 2021, as the case may be (or the appropriate portion thereof in the case of any of our first eleven calendar quarters that commences on or after January 1, 2021) (in either case, the “Trailing Twelve Quarters”) exceeds (y) the Hurdle Amount (as defined below) in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Hurdle Amount will be determined on a quarterly basis, and will be calculated by multiplying 2.0% (8% annualized) by the aggregate of our net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. For this purpose, under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including, without limitation, any accrued income that we have not yet received in cash and any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses accrued during the calendar quarter (including, without limitation, the Base Management Fee, administration expenses and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Income-Based Fee and the Capital Gains Fee). For the avoidance of doubt, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.
The calculation of the Income-Based Fee for each quarter is as follows:
(A) No Income-Based Fee will be payable to Barings in any calendar quarter in which our aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters does not exceed the Hurdle Amount;
(B) 100% of our aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Amount but is less than or equal to an amount (the “Catch-Up Amount”) determined on a quarterly basis by multiplying 2.5% (10% annualized) by our net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Catch-Up Amount is intended to provide Barings with an incentive fee of 20% on all of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income when our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income reaches the Catch-Up Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters; and 
(C) For any quarter in which our aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds the Catch-Up Amount, the Income-Based Fee shall equal 20% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such Trailing Twelve Quarters, as the Hurdle Amount and Catch-Up Amount will have been achieved.
Subject to the Incentive Fee Cap described below, the amount of the Income-Based Fee that will be paid to Barings for a particular quarter will equal the excess of the aggregate Income-Based Fee so calculated less the 
21


aggregate Income-Based Fees that were paid to Barings in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters.
(ii) The Income-Based Fee is subject to a cap (the “Incentive Fee Cap”). The Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter is an amount equal to (a) 20% of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters less (b) the aggregate Income-Based Fee that were paid to Barings in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. For this purpose, “Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return” during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters means (x) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters less (y) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, we will pay no Income-Based Fee to Barings in that quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is a positive value but is less than the Income-Based Fee calculated in accordance with paragraph (i) above, we will pay Barings the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is equal to or greater than the Income-Based Fee calculated in accordance with paragraph (i) above, we will pay Barings the Income-Based Fee for such quarter.
“Net Capital Loss” in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses on our assets, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains or other gains on our assets (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the value ascribed to any credit support arrangement in our financial statements even if such value is not categorized as a gain therein), whether realized or unrealized, in such period.
(iii) The second part of the Incentive Fee (the “Capital Gains Fee”) will be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement), commencing with the calendar year ended on December 31, 2018, and is calculated at the end of each applicable year by subtracting (1) the sum of our cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation from (2) our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, in each case calculated from August 2, 2018. If such amount is positive at the end of such year, then the Capital Gains Fee payable for such year is equal to 20% of such amount, less the cumulative aggregate amount of Capital Gains Fees paid in all prior years commencing with the calendar year ended on December 31, 2018. If such amount is negative, then there is no Capital Gains Fee payable for such year. If this Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date will be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying a Capital Gains Fee.
Under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, the "cumulative aggregate realized capital gains" are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in our portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
The "cumulative aggregate realized capital losses" are calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in our portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
The "aggregate unrealized capital depreciation" is calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in our portfolio as of the applicable Capital Gains Fee calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
Under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, the “accreted or amortized cost basis of an investment” shall mean the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment as reflected in our financial statements.
Payment of Company Expenses
Under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, all investment professionals of Barings and its staff, when and to the extent engaged in providing services required to be provided by Barings under the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to 
22


such services, are provided and paid for by Barings and not by us, except that all costs and expenses relating to our operations and transactions, including, without limitation, those items listed in the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, will be borne by us.
Duration and Termination of Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement
The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement has an initial term of two years, or until December 23, 2022. Thereafter, it will continue automatically for successive annual periods, so long as such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (A) the vote of the Board, or by the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and (B) the vote of a majority of our independent directors in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. The Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its “assignment,” as such term is defined under the 1940 Act, and may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, upon 60 days’ written notice, (i) by the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, (ii) by the vote of the Board, or (iii) by Barings. 
Administration Agreement
Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, Barings performs (or oversees, or arranges for, the performance of) the administrative services necessary for our operation, including, but not limited to, office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record-keeping services at such office facilities and such other services as Barings, subject to review by the Board, from time to time, determines to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement. Barings also, on our behalf and subject to oversight by the Board, arranges for the services of, and oversees, custodians, depositories, transfer agents, dividend disbursing agents, other stockholder servicing agents, accountants, attorneys, valuation experts, underwriters, brokers and dealers, corporate fiduciaries, insurers, banks and such other persons in any such other capacity deemed to be necessary or desirable. 
We will reimburse Barings for the costs and expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities under the Administration Agreement in an amount to be negotiated and mutually agreed to by us and Barings quarterly in arrears. In no event will the agreed-upon quarterly expense amount exceed the amount of expenses that would otherwise be reimbursable by us under the Administration Agreement for the applicable quarterly period, and Barings will not be entitled to the recoupment of any amounts in excess of the agreed-upon quarterly expense amount. The costs and expenses incurred by Barings on our behalf under the Administration Agreement include, but are not limited to:
•the allocable portion of Barings' rent for our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs, which is based upon the allocable portion of the usage thereof by such personnel in connection with their performance of administrative services under the Administration Agreement;
•the allocable portion of the salaries, bonuses, benefits and expenses of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs, which is based upon the allocable portion of the time spent by such personnel in connection with performing administrative services for us under the Administration Agreement;
•the actual cost of goods and services used for us and obtained by Barings from entities not affiliated with us, which is reasonably allocated to us on the basis of assets, revenues, time records or other methods conforming with generally accepted accounting principles;
•all fees, costs and expenses associated with the engagement of a sub-administrator, if any; and
•costs associated with (a) the monitoring and preparation of regulatory reporting, including registration statements and amendments thereto, prospectus supplements, and tax reporting, (b) the coordination and oversight of service provider activities and the direct cost of such contractual matters related thereto and (c) the preparation of all financial statements and the coordination and oversight of audits, regulatory inquiries, certifications and sub-certifications.
23


The Administration Agreement will continue automatically for successive annual periods so long as such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the Board, including a majority of the independent directors. The Administration Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by vote of the Board, or by Barings, upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party. The Administration Agreement may not be assigned by a party without the consent of the other party.
Election to be Regulated as a Business Development Company and Regulated Investment Company
We are a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. Our election to be regulated as a BDC and our election to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes have a significant impact on our operations. Some of the most important effects on our operations of our election to be regulated as a BDC and our election to be treated as a RIC are outlined below.
•We report our investments at market value or fair value with changes in value reported through our consolidated statements of operations.
In accordance with the requirements of Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we report all of our investments, including debt investments, at market value or, for investments that do not have a readily available market value, at their “fair value” as determined in good faith by the Board. Changes in these values are reported through our statements of operations under the caption of “net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments.” See “—Valuation Process and Determination of Net Asset Value” above.
•We intend to distribute substantially all of our income to our stockholders. We generally will be required to pay income taxes only on the portion of our taxable income we do not distribute, actually or constructively, to stockholders.
As a RIC, so long as we meet certain minimum distribution, source-of-income and asset diversification requirements, we generally are required to pay U.S. federal income taxes only on the portion of our taxable income and gains we do not distribute (actually or constructively) and certain built-in gains. We intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our income. We may, however, make deemed distributions to our stockholders of any retained net long-term capital gains. If this happens, our stockholders will be treated as if they received an actual distribution of the net capital gains and reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in us. Our stockholders also may be eligible to claim a tax credit (or, in certain circumstances, a tax refund) equal to their allocable share of the corporate-level U.S. federal income tax we pay on the deemed distribution. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.” We met the minimum distribution requirements for 2019, 2020 and 2021 and continually monitor our distribution requirements with the goal of ensuring compliance with the Code.
In addition, we have wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries, or the Taxable Subsidiaries, which hold a portion of one or more of our portfolio investments that are listed on the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. The Taxable Subsidiaries are consolidated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP, so that our consolidated financial statements reflect our investments in the portfolio companies owned by the Taxable Subsidiaries. The purpose of the Taxable Subsidiaries is to permit us to hold certain interests in portfolio companies that are organized as partnerships or limited liability companies, or LLCs (or other forms of pass-through entities) and still satisfy the RIC tax requirement that at least 90.0% of our gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes must consist of qualifying investment income. Absent the Taxable Subsidiaries, a proportionate amount of any gross income of a partnership or LLC (or other pass-through entity) portfolio investment would flow through directly to us. To the extent that such income did not consist of investment income, it could jeopardize our ability to qualify as a RIC and therefore cause us to incur significant amounts of corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. Where interests in partnerships or LLCs (or other pass-through entities) are owned by the Taxable Subsidiaries, however, the income from such interests is taxed to the Taxable Subsidiaries and does not flow through to us, thereby helping us preserve our RIC status and resultant tax advantages. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense as a result of its ownership of the portfolio companies. This income tax expense, if any, is reflected in our Statement of Operations.
24


•Our ability to use leverage as a means of financing our portfolio of investments is limited.
As a BDC, and as a result of the stockholder vote to approve the proposal to authorize us to be subject to the reduced asset coverage ratio of at least 150% under the 1940 Act, we are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities of at least 150%. For this purpose, senior securities include all borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future. Additionally, our ability to continue to utilize leverage as a means of financing our portfolio of investments may be limited by this asset coverage test. 
•We are required to comply with the provisions of the 1940 Act applicable to business development companies.
As a BDC, we are required to have a majority of directors who are not “interested persons" under the 1940 Act. In addition, we are required to comply with other applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, including those requiring the adoption of a code of ethics, fidelity bonding and investment custody arrangements. See “Regulation of Business Development Companies” below.
Exemptive Relief 
As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For example, we generally are not permitted to make loans to companies controlled by Barings or other funds managed by Barings. We are also not permitted to make any co-investments with Barings or its affiliates (including any fund managed by Barings or an investment adviser controlling, controlled by or under common control with Barings) without exemptive relief from the SEC, subject to certain exceptions. The Exemptive Relief that the SEC has granted to Barings permits certain present and future funds, including us, advised by Barings (or an investment adviser controlling, controlled by or under common control with Barings) to co-invest in suitable negotiated investments. Co-investments made under the Exemptive Relief are subject to compliance with the conditions and other requirements contained in the Exemptive Relief, which could limit our ability to participate in a co-investment transaction.
Regulation of Business Development Companies
The following is a general summary of the material regulatory provisions affecting BDCs. It does not purport to be a complete description of all of the laws and regulations affecting BDCs.
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act requires that a majority of the directors on a BDC's board of directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities.
In addition, the 1940 Act defines “a majority of the outstanding voting securities” as the lesser of (i) 67.0% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50.0% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) 50.0% of our voting securities.
Qualifying Assets
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70.0% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:
(1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act and rules adopted pursuant thereto as any issuer which:
(a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
25


(b) is not an investment company (other than an SBIC wholly-owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for exclusions under the 1940 Act for certain financial companies such as banks, brokers, commercial finance companies, mortgage companies and insurance companies; and
(c) satisfies any of the following:
(i) does not have any class of securities with respect to which a broker or dealer may extend margin credit;
(ii) is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company;
(iii) is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million;
(iv) does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; or
(v) has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250.0 million.
(2) Securities in companies that were eligible portfolio companies when we made our initial investment if certain other requirements are satisfied.
(3) Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control.
(4) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance (other than conventional lending or financing arrangements).
(5) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60.0% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
(6) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (5) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
(7) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2), (3) or (4) above.
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
In order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70.0% test, we must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where we purchase such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available “significant managerial assistance” means, among other things, any arrangement whereby we, through our directors, officers or employees, offer to provide, and, if accepted, do so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. Barings provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. We may receive fees for these services.
26


Temporary Investments
Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70.0% of our assets are qualifying assets. We may invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. Government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25.0% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the asset diversification tests required to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our management team will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Senior Securities
The Small Business Credit Availability Act (“SBCAA”), which was signed into law in March 2018, among other things, amended Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act to add a new Section 61(a)(2) that reduces the asset coverage requirement applicable BDCs from 200% to 150% so long as the BDC meets certain disclosure requirements and obtains certain approvals. On July 24, 2018, our stockholders voted at the 2018 Special Meeting to approve a proposal to authorize us to be subject to a reduced asset coverage ratio of at least 150% under the 1940 Act. As a result of the stockholder approval at the 2018 Special Meeting, effective July 25, 2018, our applicable asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act decreased to 150% from 200%. Thus, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding (other than senior securities representing indebtedness issued in consideration of a privately arranged loan which is not intended to be publicly distributed), we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5.0% of the value of our total assets for temporary purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “Item 1A.— Risk Factors Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — Incurring additional leverage may magnify our exposure to risks associated with changes in leverage, including fluctuations in interest rates that could adversely affect our profitability” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines
We and Barings have adopted a code of ethics (the “Global Code of Ethics Policy”) and corporate governance guidelines, which collectively cover ethics and business conduct. These documents apply to our and Barings' directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, and any person performing similar functions, and establish procedures for personal investments and restrict certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the Global Code of Ethics Policy and corporate governance guidelines may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code's requirements. Our Global Code of Ethics Policy and corporate governance guidelines are publicly available on the Investor Relations section of our website under "Corporate Governance" at https://ir.barings.com/governance-docs. We will report any amendments to or waivers of a required provision of our Global Code of Ethics Policy and corporate governance guidelines on our website or in a Current Report on Form 8-K. Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and you should not consider that information to be part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
27


Compliance Policies and Procedures
We and Barings have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the U.S. federal securities laws, and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and to designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering such policies and procedures. Michael Cowart serves as our Chief Compliance Officer.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We delegate our proxy voting responsibilities to Barings. Barings votes proxies relating to our portfolio securities in a manner which we believe will be in the best interest of our stockholders. Barings reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although Barings generally votes against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, they may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so.
The proxy voting decisions of Barings are made by the investment professionals who are responsible for monitoring each of its clients’ investments. To ensure that their vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, Barings requires that: (i) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (ii) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
Stockholders may, without charge, obtain information regarding how we voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Compliance Officer, 300 South Tryon Street, Suite 2500, Charlotte, North Carolina 28202 or by calling our investor relations department at 888-401-1088.
Other
We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of those members of the Board who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The 1940 Act prohibits us from making certain negotiated co-investments with affiliates absent prior approval of the SEC. Barings' existing Exemptive Relief permits us and Barings' affiliated private funds and SEC-registered funds to co-invest in loans originated by Barings, which allows Barings to implement its senior secured private debt investment strategy for us.
We are periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance
We are subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items. In addition, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. For example:
•pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
28


•pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
•pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and
•pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
The New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Regulations
The NYSE has adopted corporate governance regulations that listed companies must comply with. We believe we currently are in compliance with such corporate governance listing standards. We intend to monitor our compliance with all future listing standards and to take all necessary actions to ensure that we stay in compliance.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in our shares. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to us or to investors in such an investment. For example, we have not described tax consequences that we assume to be generally known by investors or certain considerations that may be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including stockholders subject to the alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, pension plans and trusts, financial institutions, U.S. stockholders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, persons who mark-to-market our shares and persons who hold our shares as part of a “straddle,” “hedge” or “conversion” transaction. This summary assumes that investors hold shares of our common stock as capital assets (within the meaning of the Code). The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. It does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets.
For purposes of our discussion, a “U.S. stockholder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
•a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•a trust if (i) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person.
For purposes of our discussion, a “Non-U.S. stockholder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is neither a U.S. stockholder nor a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes).
If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “partnership”) holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner or member of the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner or member and the activities of the partnership. A prospective stockholder that is a partner or member in a partnership holding shares of our common stock should consult his, her or its tax advisors with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of our common stock.
29


Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our shares will depend on the facts of his, her or its particular situation. We encourage investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific consequences of such an investment, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty and the effect of any changes in the tax laws.
Election to be Taxed as a RIC
We have qualified and elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2007. As a RIC, we generally are not subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders from our tax earnings and profits. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to obtain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our "investment company taxable income" ("ICTI"), which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gain over realized net long-term capital loss, (the "Annual Distribution Requirement"). Even if we qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and could be subject to U.S. federal excise, state, local and foreign taxes.
Taxation as a RIC
Provided that we qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our ICTI and net capital gain (which we define as net long-term capital gain in excess of net short-term capital loss) that we timely distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98.0% of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and (iii) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.
In order to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
•meet the Annual Distribution Requirement;
•qualify to be treated as a BDC or be registered as a management investment company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;
•derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or other securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership” (as defined in the Code), or the 90% Income Test; and
•diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
◦at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer (which for these purposes includes the equity securities of a “qualified publicly traded partnership”); and
◦no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. Government securities or securities of other RICs, (i) of one issuer (ii) of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) of one or more “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or the Diversification Tests.
30


To the extent that we invest in entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership”), we generally must include the items of gross income derived by the partnerships for purposes of the 90% Income Test, and the income that is derived from a partnership (other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership”) will be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test only to the extent that such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership which would be qualifying income if realized by us directly. In addition, we generally must take into account our proportionate share of the assets held by partnerships (other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership”) in which we are a partner for purposes of the Diversification Tests.
In order to meet the 90% Income Test, we utilize the Taxable Subsidiaries, and in the future may establish additional such corporations, to hold assets from which we do not anticipate earning dividend, interest or other qualifying income under the 90% Income Test. Any investments held through the Taxable Subsidiaries generally are subject to U.S. federal income and other taxes, and therefore we can expect to achieve a reduced after-tax yield on such investments.
We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. We anticipate that a portion of our income may constitute original issue discount or other income required to be included in taxable income prior to receipt of cash.
Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our ICTI for the year of the accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and to avoid the 4.0% U.S. federal excise tax, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. As a result, we may have difficulty meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement necessary to obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment under the Code. We may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forgo new investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax.
Furthermore, a portfolio company in which we invest may face financial difficulty that requires us to work-out, modify or otherwise restructure our investment in the portfolio company. Any such restructuring may result in unusable capital losses and future non-cash income. Any restructuring may also result in our recognition of a substantial amount of non-qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test, such as cancellation of indebtedness income in connection with the work-out of a leveraged investment (which, while not free from doubt, may be treated as non-qualifying income) or the receipt of other non-qualifying income.
Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.
Investments by us in non-U.S. securities may be subject to non-U.S. income, withholding and other taxes, and therefore, our yield on any such securities may be reduced by such non-U.S. taxes. Stockholders will generally not be entitled to claim a credit or deduction with respect to non-U.S. taxes paid by us.
If we purchase shares in a “passive foreign investment company,” or PFIC, we may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any “excess distribution” or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a taxable dividend by us to our stockholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains. If we invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a “qualified electing fund” under the Code, or QEF, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, 
31


even if such income is not distributed to it. Alternatively, we can elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in a PFIC; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it does not exceed prior increases included in income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of our distributions from PFICs and our proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax. 
Under Section 988 of the Code, gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time we accrue income, expenses, or other liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time we actually collect such income or pay such expenses or liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or loss. Similarly, gain or loss on foreign currency forward contracts and the disposition of debt denominated in a foreign currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss.
We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. Under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. See “Regulation of Business Development Companies — Qualifying Assets” and “Regulation of Business Development Companies — Senior Securities" above. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (i) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (ii) other requirements relating to our tax treatment as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or to avoid the excise tax, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
If we fail to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or otherwise fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC in any taxable year, we will be subject to tax in that year on all of our taxable income, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. In that case, all of such income will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax, reducing the amount available to be distributed to our stockholders. See “Failure To Obtain RIC Tax Treatment" below.
As a RIC, we are not allowed to carry forward or carry back a net operating loss for purposes of computing our ICTI in other taxable years. U.S. federal income tax law generally permits a RIC to carry forward (i) the excess of its net short-term capital loss over its net long-term capital gain for a given year as a short-term capital loss arising on the first day of the following year and (ii) the excess of its net long-term capital loss over its net short-term capital gain for a given year as a long-term capital loss arising on the first day of the following year. Future transactions we engage in may cause our ability to use any capital loss carryforwards, and unrealized losses once realized, to be limited under Section 382 of the Code. Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain and qualified dividend income into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (iii) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (iv) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (vii) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the effect of these provisions.
As described above, to the extent that we invest in equity securities of entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the effect of such investments for purposes of the 90% Income Test and the Diversification Tests will depend on whether or not the partnership is a “qualified publicly traded partnership” (as defined in the Code). If the entity is a “qualified publicly traded partnership,” the net income derived from such investments will be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test and will be “securities” for purposes of the Diversification Tests. If the entity is not treated as a “qualified publicly traded partnership,” however, the consequences of an investment in the partnership will depend upon the amount and type of income and assets of the partnership allocable to us. The income derived from such investments may not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test and, therefore, could adversely affect our tax treatment as a RIC. We intend to monitor our 
32


investments in equity securities of entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes to prevent our disqualification from tax treatment as a RIC.
We may invest in preferred securities or other securities the U.S. federal income tax treatment of which may not be clear or may be subject to recharacterization by the IRS. To the extent the tax treatment of such securities or the income from such securities differs from the expected tax treatment, it could affect the timing or character of income recognized, requiring us to purchase or sell securities, or otherwise change our portfolio, in order to comply with the tax rules applicable to RICs under the Code.
We may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash or shares of our common stock at the election of each stockholder. Under certain applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury regulations, distributions payable in cash or in shares of stock at the election of stockholders are treated as taxable dividends. The Internal Revenue Service has published guidance indicating that this rule will apply even where the total amount of cash that may be distributed is limited to no more than 20% of the total distribution (10% in case of distributions through June 30, 2022). Under this guidance, if too many stockholders elect to receive their distributions in cash, the cash available for distribution must be allocated among the stockholders electing to receive cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). If we decide to make any distributions consistent with this guidance that are payable in part in our stock, taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend (whether received in cash, our stock, or a combination thereof) as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain dividend) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our stock.
Failure to Obtain RIC Tax Treatment
If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level federal taxes or to dispose of certain assets).
If we were unable to obtain tax treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions would generally be taxable to our stockholders as dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (in the case of non-corporate U.S. stockholders, generally at a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income of 20%). Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain.
If we fail to meet the RIC requirements for more than two consecutive years and then, seek to re-qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to corporate-level taxation on any built-in gain recognized during the succeeding five-year period unless we made a special election to recognize all such built-in gain upon our re-qualification for tax treatment as a RIC and to pay the corporate-level tax on such built-in gain.

Possible Legislative or Other Actions Affecting Tax Considerations
Prospective investors should recognize that the present U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in our stock may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made. The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect the tax consequences of an investment in our stock. See "Risk Factors - Risk Relating to Our Business and Structure - We cannot predict how tax reform legislation will affect us, our investments, or our stockholders, and any such legislation could adversely affect our business" included in Item 1A or Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Withholding
Our distributions generally will be treated as dividends for U.S. tax purposes and will be subject to U.S. income or withholding tax unless the shareholder receiving the dividend qualifies for an exemption from U.S. tax or the distribution is subject to one of the special look-through rules described below. Distributions paid out of net capital gains can qualify for a reduced rate of taxation in the hands of an individual U.S. shareholder and an exemption from U.S. tax in the hands of a non-U.S. shareholder. 
Under an exemption, properly reported dividend distributions by RICs paid out of certain interest income (such distributions, “interest-related dividends”) are generally exempt from U.S. withholding tax for non-U.S. shareholders. Under such exemption, a non-U.S. shareholder generally may receive interest-related dividends free of U.S. withholding tax if the shareholder would not have been subject to U.S. withholding tax if it had received the underlying interest income directly. No assurance can be given as to whether any of our distributions will be eligible for this exemption from U.S. withholding tax or, if eligible, will be reported as such by us. In particular, the exemption does apply to distributions paid in respect of a RIC’s non-U.S. source interest income, its dividend income or its foreign currency gains. In the case shares of our stock are held through an intermediary, the intermediary may withhold U.S. federal income tax even if we report the payment as a dividend eligible for the exemption.
State and Local Tax Treatment
The state and local tax treatment may differ from U.S. federal income tax treatment.
The discussion set forth herein does not constitute tax advice, and potential investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax considerations relevant to their particular situation.
