These products are wearable back compression devices, used to relax, warmup, loosen, or relax stiff & sore muscles.

 We have recently successfully completed our first acquisition of “Sustainable Origins” which is an eco-friendly ESG company, that converts used cooking oil to reusable biodiesel. This acquisition is part of our ongoing strategic plan for future revenue and expansion. While our primary focus will always be revolving around the innovation of wearable technology, these projects will take time to market.
