Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are improving business through data science and analytics by enabling analytic producers, regardless of technical acumen, to quickly and easily transform data into actionable insights and deliver improved data-driven business outcomes. Every day, our users leverage our end-to-end analytic platform to quickly and easily discover, access, prepare, and analyze data from a multitude of sources, then deploy and share analytics at scale. The ease-of-use, speed, and sophistication that our platform provides is enhanced through intuitive and highly repeatable visual workflows.
Leveraging data for actionable insights is critical to modern business success, but has become increasingly challenging as the volume, velocity, and variety of data continues to expand. Traditional data analysis tools and processes are slow, complex, difficult to use, and resource-intensive, often requiring multiple steps by data analysts, data scientists, information technology, or IT, employees, and other data workers to complete even the most basic analysis. As a result, these tools and processes are unable to keep pace with the rapid analytics demanded by organizations today.
Our platform democratizes access to data-driven insights by expanding the capabilities and analytical sophistication available to all data producers, ranging from business analysts to expert programmers and trained data scientists. We bring the fragmented analytic process into one simple and unified self-service experience, combining tasks that were previously distributed among multiple tools and parties. Our platform allows a single user to easily discover, access, and prepare data from a multitude of sources, perform a variety of analyses, and deliver analytical output to drive data-driven decisions and improve business outcomes. This is done through visual workflows and an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that can eliminate the need to write code and reduce tedious, time-consuming tasks to a few mouse-clicks. The resulting opportunity is significant, as our platform can enable millions of underserved data workers to more effectively do their jobs.
Organizations of all sizes and across a wide variety of industries and geographies have adopted our platform. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,700 customers in more than 70 countries, including over 500 of the Global 2,000 companies. Our customers include Barclays PLC, The Coca-Cola Company, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, Ford Motor Company, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Nike, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., Tableau Software, Inc., and the United States Department of Defense. Our platform is also leveraged by leading management consulting organizations such as Accenture plc, Bain & Company, and Boston Consulting Group.
We employ a “land and expand” business model. Our go-to-market approach often begins with a free trial of Alteryx Designer and is followed by an initial purchase of our platform offerings. As organizations realize the benefits derived from our platform, use frequently spreads across departments, divisions, and geographies through word-of-mouth, collaboration, and standardization of business processes. Over time, many of our customers find that the use of our platform is more strategic and collaborative in nature and our platform becomes a fundamental element of their operational business processes.
Customers license our platform under a subscription-based model, and we have seen rapid expansion as adoption spreads across an enterprise through both an increase in the number of users and additional use cases. For each of the last twelve quarters, including the quarter ended December 31, 2018, our dollar-based net expansion rate has exceeded 120%. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Business Metrics” for additional information regarding our dollar-based net expansion rate and customers. We have made significant investments to grow our business, including in sales and marketing, infrastructure, operations, and headcount. 
Our Solution
Our analytics platform enables organizations to dramatically improve business outcomes and the productivity of their business analysts, data scientists and citizen data scientists. Our subscription-based platform allows organizations to easily discover, access, prepare, and analyze data from a multitude of sources and benefit from data-driven decisions. Our platform is:

• | Efficient. We offer a self-service platform that allows business analysts to perform analysis on their own that traditionally required multiple parties and work streams to complete. Our in-memory software engine is designed to ingest and process large volumes of data rapidly and enable responsive and agile analysis, delivering dramatically “faster time to insights.” Once a workflow has been assembled, the analysis can be repeated in minutes and shared

with others who can easily replicate the analysis. With our platform, data analysis is automated, repeatable, and shareable.

• | Independent. We enable business analysts to rapidly answer challenging business questions on their own, without the need for support from expert programmers, trained data scientists, or other members of the IT department. Our platform offers analytics with easily understandable drag-and-drop tools that have easy-to-configure parameters that do not require coding. With our platform, business analysts can manage all steps in an analytic process without the assistance of their IT departments.


• | Flexible. Our platform does not require a pre-packaged, static data set and instead allows the user to create a visual workflow to securely interact with the underlying source data. Workflows can be easily changed and reconfigured to iterate an analysis and add a new data source or logic. They also can be easily adapted to conform with changes in the underlying data to repeat the analysis. This flexibility allows workflows to be configured to address a wide range of use cases. Business analysts can build apps that let others interact with the workflow through a simple interface available on the public or private cloud or they can configure a workflow to output results directly to a database or system of record. Our platform also outputs to most visual formats such as those offered by Microsoft, Qlik Technologies, Inc., and Tableau.


• | Sophisticated. Our platform provides business analysts an extensive set of analytical capabilities. Our drag-and-drop visual workflow environment includes capabilities that allow users to: access data from a variety of locations such as a local desktop, a relational database, or the cloud; prepare data for analysis; blend multiple data sources regardless of the data structure or format, including big data technologies; gain access to over 50 pre-packaged tools that enable the most widely used procedures for predictive analytics, grouping, and forecasting; and take advantage of geospatial data to drive understanding of topics such as trade areas and drive-time analysis.


• | Scalable. Our platform offers a secure collaboration environment for even the largest organizations. Business analysts can create, publish, and share analytic applications across the organization, embed analytic processes into other internal applications, and save and access workflows within a centralized repository with version control when working across multiple teams. The ability to deploy our platform on-premise or in the cloud also provides additional flexibility to scale as each customer’s business needs grow. By pushing analytical workloads to a reliable server architecture, customers can run sophisticated compute-intensive processes more efficiently than local machines allow, while automating and scheduling these workflows to give business analysts stronger control of their analytic landscape.

Our Technology
Underpinning our platform is a set of technological innovations that make robust data analytics easy through an in-memory engine, sophisticated analytic models, and an open and modular core:
In-Memory Engine
Our in-memory engine is optimized to process data within RAM and can utilize disk, when necessary, as temporary virtual memory. This facilitates significantly faster and more secure processing of data than traditional disk-based mechanisms while ensuring that the source data remains unaltered and is not duplicated. In addition to our high speed in-memory processing capabilities, our platform enables in-database processing to take advantage of computing resources where the data resides for certain use cases involving large data sets. Key features of our engine include:


• | Connected. Business analysts can rapidly connect to data in existing formats and locations, reducing the need for time-consuming data transformation processes that typically require IT personnel.


• | Non-persisted. Our engine leverages non-persisted data pipelines to enable users to process large amounts of data securely while applying complex logic every time they run an analytic workflow.


• | Scaled-out. While most workflows can be run on any single desktop or laptop, when greater processing capability is required, workloads can be pushed to a server or cluster of servers, including Hadoop or Spark clusters.

Sophisticated Analytic Models
We enable business analysts, data scientists and citizen data scientists to produce analytics ranging from basic to highly complex, including predictive, prescriptive, and spatial. Specifically, we enable predictive analytics through utilization of R, an open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing, and Python, a popular programming language for analytics with many publicly available packages. Our capabilities allow transparency and editing of the R and Python code without requiring prior coding experience. In addition, in-database processing enables analysts to scale predictive analytics and harness the value of large sets of data without moving the data out of a database, improving predictive model development performance over traditional approaches. Deep geo-spatial tools, such as a drive time engine, create the basis for performing location-based analysis.
Open and Modular Core
Our platform is built with an open and modular core that enables additional functions and programming models to interact with it. For example, our platform can utilize R for advanced analytics while providing a simple drag-and-drop interface that abstracts the complexity of the underlying code. For sophisticated business analysts, the underlying code is available for review and adjustment. The integration of our platform with R and Python takes advantage of segmented, but integrated main-memory resources to ensure seamless, fast operations. More recently, we introduced the JavaScript V8 engine for our platform in a similar capacity. This enables the introduction of new HTML5 UI, Server-side JavaScript, and JSON/REST APIs to all fuel the innovation being driven from our platform.

Many of our current and potential competitors, particularly the large software companies named above, have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, professional services, or other resources and greater name recognition than us. We expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the self-service data analytics software market, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products and services and technologies are introduced.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:


• | ease of use;


• | platform features, quality, functionality, reliability, performance, and effectiveness;


• | ability to automate analytical tasks or processes;


• | ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;


• | vision for the market and product innovation;


• | software analytics expertise;


• | total cost of ownership;


• | adherence to industry standards and certifications;

• | customer experience, including support.

We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of the factors described above. Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance and quality of our platform.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. We currently rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to protect our intellectual property. We also currently have four patent applications pending in the United States. We pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. Additionally, we generally require employees, consultants, customers, suppliers, and channel partners to execute confidentiality agreements with us that restrict the disclosure of our intellectual property. We also generally require our employees and consultants to execute employee intellectual property protection agreements with us that protect our intellectual property rights.
Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult.
We expect that software and other applications in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps.
