Item 1.  Business
 Company Overview
  
 We are a leading provider of support services to the government contracting market. Generally speaking, our clients are companies that serve the government. We:
  
  ●
  Capture business by helping our clients to win government contracts.

 
  ●
  Manage risk by being prepared for, and responding to, disruptive events and creating secure systems.

 
  ●
  Run client back-end services by providing various managed services.

 
  ●
  Perform their contract requirements by providing specialized staffing services primarily in the aerospace and aviation industries.

 
 We support the government contracting industry that:
  
  ●
  Represented over $439 billion of U.S. federal government spending in FY 2017 according to USASpending.gov.

 
  ●
  Has proven to be relatively recession resistant.

 
  ●
  Has, according to the U.S. federal government’s SAM database, as of January 2, 2018, over 528,000 government contractors of which over 52,000 are located in Washington, DC, Maryland and Virginia, many of which are located in an area commonly known as the "Beltway" and are in close proximity to our headquarters.

 
 We see the professional services support sector of the industry in which we operate as:
  
  ●
  Highly fragmented

 
  ●
  Comprised of numerous small- and medium-sized businesses that are ripe for consolidation.

 
 We believe these factors provide extraordinary growth opportunities for us.

  Description of Services
  
  Government Contracting Support Solutions

  Market intelligence and opportunity identification

 
  ●
  Capture and strategic advisory

 
  ●
  Proposal strategy and development

 
  ●
  Teaming support

 
  ●
  Managed human capital services

 
 Our services also help commercially-focused firms gain entry into the government contracting market. Since 1983, we have assisted our clients with over $170 billion of government contract awards.
  Risk  Mitigation and Crisis Management
  
 We combine best practice consulting with proven crisis management expertise, empowering clients to both anticipate and evaluate risks and manage disruptive events when they occur. We assess, audit, develop, train and test strategies and programs encompassing:
 
  ●
  Predictive intelligence

 
  ●
  Business continuity

 
  ●
  Risk assessment

 
  ●
  Crisis management and communications

 
  ●
  Emergency and cyber incident response

 
  ●
  Behavioral risk and threat assessment

 
  ●
  Workplace violence prevention

 
 We are focused on prevention in addition to planning and response initiatives. For example, our behavioral risk and threat assessment program, BERTHA®, positions schools, businesses and other organizations to prevent violence from occurring. This program helps our clients to identify early warning signs that may be exhibited by an individual before they are on a path to violence.
  
 By educating others on emerging threats and strategies to combat those threats, we increase awareness of our initiatives through no-fee webinars, stress tests, and social media and blog articles that include analyses by members of our highly-credentialed expert council. We partner with industry associations and aggregators to deliver meaningful risk mitigation strategies and education. We also serve clients ranging from some of the world’s largest global companies to main street businesses across all industry sectors. We offer services to clients that enhance their ability to manage risk and respond to adverse events, thereby minimizing people, brand, reputation, financial, legal and regulatory impacts.

  Specialty Staffing
  
 We provide quality specialized contract personnel, temp-to-hire professionals, direct hires, and temporary or seasonal hires to the Department of Defense and a diverse group of companies in the aerospace and aviation industry nationally and have been instrumental in placing highly-skilled technical professionals in some of the world’s most prestigious engineering firms and government facilities for over 20 years. Some of the professionals that we place in the aerospace and aviation industry include:
  
  ●
  FAA Certified Airframe & Power Plant Mechanics

 
  ●
  Avionics and Embedded Software Engineers

 
  ●
  FCC Certified Avionic Technicians

 
  ●
  I.A. Licensed Aircraft Inspectors

 
  ●
  Flight Test Engineers

 
  ●
  Process/Repair Engineers

 
  ●
  Simulation Engineers

 
 Since they operate as professional services companies, our recent acquisitions of Global Technical Services, Inc. and Global Contract Professionals, Inc. (collectively referred to as “Global” or the "Global Entities") represented a material change in our business operations, but were consistent with our corporate strategy of acquiring and building professional services companies that add to the product mix that we can provide to our subsidiaries’ existing customer base. Because of the time-sensitive aspects of their contracts, specialty staffing is a service that most large aviation and aerospace companies need, and our customers use specialty staffing to fulfill a variety of roles. We believe Global also has the potential to provide specialty staffing support to contractors outside of the aviation and aerospace sectors, thereby supporting a wider spectrum of clients. After completing the acquisition, we began, and are currently continuing the integration of the administrative functions and marketing efforts of Global into our operations.
 Our Industry
  
 According to USASpending.gov, the U.S. federal government spent an average of over $450 billion each year from FY 2013 through 2017 for goods and services, creating one of the largest and most stable markets in the world, and there are thousands of government contractors providing these goods and services. We provide professional services that offer scalable and compliant outsourced support to companies that deliver these goods and services.
  
 The industry in which we operate is fragmented with many small firms providing niche services.
  
 A unique characteristic of this industry is that many of these companies are concentrated in the Beltway. The U.S. federal government’s contract spending in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia was more than $92 billion in FY 2017, according to USASpending.gov. This represents 21% of the $436 billion of total contract spending in FY 2017.
  
 Because of the geographic concentration of these clients, there is also a large, but fragmented, concentration of service providers for these companies. Although the businesses that provide resources to the government contracting sector are diverse and highly fragmented, their clients have many common needs resulting from the basic qualifications and standard requirements inherent in the government procurement process. We believe that there is a unique opportunity for consolidation in this sector, both in the Washington, DC market, and in other parts of the country.
  
 While our immediate goal is to improve our ability to serve this sector by pooling our subsidiaries’ resources and client contacts, our ultimate objective is to expand our ability to meet the unique needs of this sector by assembling, through organic growth and strategic acquisitions, a complimentary suite of service and systems providers with demonstrated ability to satisfy its need for high value talent and support services. In addition to the benefits of shared costs and pooled resources, we expect to benefit from the increased client involvement that targeted expansion of our market segments can provide. Drawing on the insights and experience of our combined leadership team, we expect to both increase our contact with, and improve our understanding of, the needs of the enterprises we serve. We would like to be recognized as the best place to go for outsourced services when a government contractor must meet an unusual need.

  Clients
  
 To be a government contractor, a company must be able to meet rigid standards. As a result, our clients are typically well-established, financially-stable businesses with both a reputation for excellence and high standards and a demonstrated ability to survive and prosper through innovation and adaptation.
  
 The U.S. federal government’s SAM database as of March 23, 2018 includes over 529,000 government contractors and approximately 52,000 are located in Washington, DC, Maryland and Virginia. Government contractors range from small privately-owned lifestyle companies to members of the Fortune 100.
  
 Since 1983, we have served thousands of these entities. In 2017, we provided services to 14 of the Top 100 largest federal contractors (based on their fiscal 2016 prime contracts in IT, systems integration, professional services and telecommunications) as identified by Washington Technology (https://washingtontechnology.com/toplists/top-100-lists/2017.aspx).
  
  Marketing and Sales
  
 We obtain client engagements primarily through business development efforts, cross-selling of our services to existing clients, and maintaining client relationships, as well as referrals from existing and former clients.
  
 Our business development efforts emphasize lead generation, industry group networking and corporate visibility. Most of our business development efforts are led by members of our professional teams, who are also responsible for managing projects. Our business development efforts are further supported by personnel located at our corporate headquarters.
  
 We are working to position ourselves as a preferred, single-source provider of specialized professional services to our clients. As our service offerings become more diverse, we anticipate increasing our cross-selling opportunities. Our goals are to offer a broader range of services to existing clients and to broaden our client base using our existing value-added solutions.
  
  Competition
  
 We believe that the sectors in which we operate are highly fragmented and characterized by many smaller companies generally having fewer than ten employees. These companies tend to focus their operations on local customers or specialized niche activities. As a result, we compete with many smaller, more specialized companies that concentrate their resources in particular areas of expertise. The extent of our competition varies according to sectors and geographic areas.
  
 We believe we compete on quality of service, relevant experience, staffing capabilities, reputation, geographic presence, stability, and price. Price differentiation remains an important element in competitive tendering and is a significant factor in bidding for contracts. The importance of the foregoing factors varies widely based upon the nature, location, and scale of our clients’ needs. We believe that certain economies of scale can be realized by service providers that establish a national presence and reputation for providing high-quality and cost-effective services. Our ability to compete successfully will depend upon the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, the strength of our client relationships, our ability to accurately estimate costs and bid for work, the quality of the work we perform and our ability to hire and train qualified personnel.
  
  Competitive Strengths
  
 We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
  
  ●
  Experienced, talented, and motivated professionals – We employ seasoned professionals with a broad array of specialties, a strong customer service orientation and in many cases, the required professional certifications and advanced degrees. Our executive officers have significant operating and management experience and have been involved in analyzing potential acquisition transactions. We place a high priority on attracting, motivating and retaining top professionals to serve our clients, and our compensation system emphasizes the use of performance-based incentives, including opportunities for stock ownership, to achieve this objective.

 
  ●
  Niche expertise – The services that we provide are highly-specialized professional services that have high barriers to entry. While we have a base of in-house professionals, we also have access to a very large group of consultants who can provide subject matter expertise for unique projects and who can supplement our workforce based on client demand.

  ●
  Industry-recognized quality of service – We believe that we have developed a strong reputation for quality service based upon our industry-recognized depth of experience, ability to attract and retain quality professionals, and expertise across multiple service sectors.

 
  ●
  Strong, long-term client relationships – Our combination of niche market experience and professionals with requisite expertise has enabled us to develop strong relationships with our core clients. By serving clients on a long-term basis, we are able to gain a deep understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their projects. This increased understanding gives us the opportunity to provide superior value to our clients by allowing us to more fully assess and better manage the risks inherent in their projects.

 
  ●
  One-stop shop – The combination of services we offer allows our clients to focus on executing their contracts and getting more work by not being encumbered with administrative functions required when doing business with the government.

 
  Growth Strategies
  
 We intend to use the following growth strategies as we seek to expand our market share in our current areas of expertise and eventually position ourselves as a preferred provider of comprehensive specialized professional services to our clients:
  
  ●
  Strategic Acquisitions – We seek acquisitions that allow us to expand or enhance our capabilities in our existing service offerings. In analyzing new acquisitions, we pursue opportunities that function as profitable stand-alone operations or are complementary to our existing businesses. We believe that expanding our business through strategic acquisitions will enable us to exploit economies of scale in the areas of finance, human resources, marketing, administration, information technology, and legal, while also providing cross-selling opportunities among our vertical service offerings.

 
  ●
  Common Theme – Most government contractors need the various services that we provide. Our companies sell to the same client pool allowing for one-stop-shop, cross selling opportunities.

 
  ●
  Geographic Expansion – Parts of the country have substantial government presence that allow for easy expansion of our footprint, such as the U.S. Navy in San Diego and the U.S. Air Force in Denver.

 
  ●
  Business Development – With additional resources we intend to grow our business by investing in a larger sales force and integrated client relationship management tools.

 
 The universe of providers that service our clients is fragmented and diverse. Drawing on the insights and experience of our combined leadership team, we expect to both increase our contact with, and improve our understanding of, the needs of the enterprises we serve. By working together under common leadership, we believe our combined companies can better identify the qualities in our companies that the world’s leading businesses value most. We will then work to further enhance each company’s ability to perform in these areas by providing material support as well as exchanges of talent and ideas. By using our increased contact with our clients, we will also be working to enhance our clients’ awareness of these capabilities across our platform.
  
 Through our core businesses, we occasionally become aware of situations where our resources can play a critical role in bringing an organization to the next level in its development. Under appropriate circumstances we may acquire, receive or retain an interest in these organizations as part of our enterprise initiative. Brekford Traffic Safety, Inc. (“Brekford”) serves as a public safety technology services provider of fully integrated automated traffic safety enforcement solutions, including speed and red-light enforcement cameras, and a comprehensive citation management software suite. Brekford has recently announced the development of a first-of-its-kind camera and data management system designed to track and monitor violations of “move over laws.” The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund reports that in the past decade, 126 police officers have been killed when struck by vehicles. The Emergency Responder Safety Institute estimates that about seven emergency workers and 50 tow operators are killed annually by passing vehicles. In addition, there are many unreported injuries and near misses.

Any revision in the purchase price allocation will be included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future periods.
  
  Global Acquisition
  
 On October 1, 2017 (the “Global Closing Date”), the Company completed its acquisition of Global Technical Services, Inc. (“GTS”) and Global Contract Professionals, Inc. (“GCP) (collectively, the “Global Entities”) (the “Global Merger”). Consideration paid as part Global Merger included: (a) $750,000 in cash, (b) 375,000 shares of Novume common stock and (c) 240,861 shares of Novume Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Novume Series B Preferred Stock”).

  Firestorm Acquisition
  
 On January 25, 2017 (the “Firestorm Closing Date”), Novume acquired the Firestorm Entities. Pursuant to the terms of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “MIPA”), by and among Novume, each of the Firestorm Entities, each of the Members of the Firestorm Entities, and a newly created acquisition subsidiary of Novume, Firestorm Holdings, LLC (“Firestorm Holdings”), Novume acquired all of the membership interests in each of the Firestorm Entities for the following consideration:
 
  ● 
 $500,000 in cash in the aggregate paid by Novume as of the Firestorm Closing Date to the three principals of Firestorm (“Firestorm Principals”);


  ● 
 $1,000,000 in the aggregate in the form of four unsecured, subordinated promissory notes issued by Novume payable over five years after the Firestorm Closing Date, to all the members (consisting of the Firestorm Principals and the fourth member of the Firestorm Entities (the “Fourth Member”). The notes payable to the Firestorm Principals are individually referred to herein as a “Firestorm Principal Note” and collectively, as the “Firestorm Principal Notes”. The Firestorm Principal Notes are payable at an interest rate of 2% and the Fourth Member Note is payable at an interest rate of 7%;


  ● 
 Each of the Firestorm Principals was issued 162,698 (315,625 post Brekford Merger) shares of Novume common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, for an aggregate issuance of 488,094 (946,875 post Brekford Merger) shares of Novume common stock;


  ● 
 Each of the Firestorm Principals received warrants to purchase 54,233 (105,209 post Brekford Merger) shares of Novume common stock, exercisable over a period of five years after the Firestorm Closing Date, at an exercise price of $2.58 per share; and


  ● 
 Each of the Firestorm Principals received warrants to purchase 54,233 (105,209 post Brekford Merger) shares of Novume common stock, exercisable over a period of five years after the Firestorm Closing Date, at an exercise price of $3.60 per share.

 
  Reportable Segments
  
 Based on its analysis of current operations, management has determined that Novume has only one reportable segment, which is Novume. Management will continue to reevaluate its segment reporting as the Company grows and matures. However, the chief operating decision-maker currently uses aggregate results to make operating and strategic decisions, and, therefore, the Company believes its entire operation is currently covered under a single reportable segment.
 Employees
  
 As of March 31, 2018, Novume had 120 employees, of which 110 were full time, and access to approximately 400 consultants. We consider our employee relations to be good. To date, we have been able to locate and engage highly-qualified employees as needed and do not expect our growth efforts to be constrained by a lack of qualified personnel.
 Trends and Seasonality
  
 We generate revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services primarily billed on an hourly rate, time-and-materials (“T&M”) basis. Clients are typically invoiced monthly, with revenue recognized as the services are provided. T&M contracts represent over 95% of our client engagements and do not provide us with a high degree of predictability of future period performance. In a few cases, a fixed-fee engagement for our services may be entered into. Fixed-fee engagements can be invoiced once for the entire job, or there could be several “progress” invoices for accomplishing various phases or reaching contractual milestones.
  
 Novume’s financial results are impacted principally by the:
 
  1) 
 demand by clients for services;


  2) 
 the degree to which full-time staff can be kept occupied in revenue-generating activities;


  3) 
 success of the sales team in generating client engagements; and


  4) 
 number of business days in each quarter.


 
   
10


  

 The number of business days on which revenue is generated by our staff and consultants is affected by the number of vacation days taken, as well as the number of holidays in each quarter. There are typically fewer business work days available in the fourth quarter of the year, which can impact revenues during that period. The staff utilization rate can also be affected by seasonal variations in the demand for services from clients. Since earnings may be affected by these seasonal variations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.
  
 Unexpected changes in the demand for our services can result in significant variations in revenues, and present a challenge to optimal hiring, staffing and use of consultants. The volume of work performed can vary from period to period.
  
  Insurance and Risk Management
  
  We maintain insurance covering professional liability and claims involving bodily injury, property and economic loss. We consider our present limits of coverage, deductibles, and reserves to be adequate. Whenever possible, we endeavor to eliminate or reduce the risk of loss on a project through the use of quality assurance and control, risk management, workplace safety, and other similar methods.
  
  Risk management is an integral part of our project management approach for fixed-price contracts and our project execution process. We also evaluate risk through internal risk analyses in which our management reviews higher-risk projects, contracts, or other business decisions that require corporate legal and risk management approval.
  
  Regulation
  
 We are regulated in some of the fields in which we operate. When working with governmental agencies and entities, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts. These laws and regulations contain terms that, among other things may require certification and disclosure of all costs or pricing data in connection with various contract negotiations. We also work with U.S. federal government contractors and have staff cleared to work on classified materials. One of our leased facilities is cleared for classified material. We are subject to the laws and regulations that restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes.
  
 To help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees are sometimes required to complete tailored ethics and other compliance training relevant to their position and our operations.
