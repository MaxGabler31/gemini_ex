Since its incorporation until September 2014, Umatrin remained dormant. On April 26, 2013, Umatrin was awarded with a direct selling license (number AJL932015) by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs in Malaysia. However, since April 26, 2013 and until September 2014, Umatrin maintained no operation.
 
On July 3, 2014 and August 12, 2014, Umatrin appointed both Dato’ Liew Kok Hong (“Dato’ Liew”) and Dato’ Sri as the company’s directors. Together, Dato’ Liew and Dato’ Sri with Dato’ Ho Phooi Keow (“Dato’ Ho”), the co-founder of Umatrin, decided to start the business and expand it throughout Asia as a leading Online to Offline (O2O) company that provides technology, products and services to enable consumers, merchants, and other participants to conduct E-commerce on its I-Cloud ecosystem. As of the date of this Annual Report, both Dato’ Liew and Dato’ Ho have resigned from their positions at the Company due to respective personal reasons.
 
As an early-stage company, Umatrin focuses on health and beauty care products. Umatrin had cooperated with several corporations and is appointed as their sole distributor for their health and beauty care products in Asia. Umatrin introduces its products via online platform and offline platform which is our retail shop. At our retail store, Umatrin also provides training and product introductory speeches to public.
 
At the early stage of our business, our marketing teams focus on selling our products to the end-user and also introduced an Independent Dealer Program to our customer. To be qualified, the customer only needs to host a product demo and then will receive a discount on product purchases and earn additional credit for each product sold during the demo. Consequently, our customer will become our Independent Dealer. As to date, we have about 20,000 dealers selling our products.
 
Main Business Activities
 
Although Umatrin was awarded a Multi-Level Marketing License, Umatrin did not operate by way of multi-level marketing strategy. Instead, Umatrin applies leading O2O (Online to Offline) marketing strategy to both retail and wholesale trade. Umatrin provides technology and services to enable consumers, merchants and other participants to conduct business in our cloud-based trading system.
 
Umatrin uses advanced network technology and rigorous management system to create unlimited business brand space. Without allocating large sums of operating cost, it continuously introduces new products, combined with O2O internet business model and career opportunities.

Each and every new product launched will be communicated to our existing customers and to the public. Since September 2014, our best seller products include:
(a) Hydrogen Antioxidant Water Purifier
 
Water is a fundamental to human. Each person on Earth requires at least 20 to 50 liters of clean, safe water a day for drinking, cooking and, simply keeping themselves clean. Polluted water isn’t just dirty – it’s deadly. Every year 1.8 million people die of diarrheal diseases like cholera. In short, the origin of healthy life is sustained by pure and clean water.
 
Umatrin introduces the Hydrogen Antioxidant Water Purifier to produce pure and clean water for our customers. The product is manufactured by Hyundai Warcotec Co. Ltd. from Korea. This product removes water impurities using 4 types of filters:

Industry Trends- Anti-Aging Products Market
 
The global market for Anti-Aging Products is projected to exceed US$260 billion by 2022, driven by the expanding base of aging population, growing prominence of non-invasive cosmetic procedures and steady launch of high-efficacy products. The desire to look young and retain beauty and health is a major consumer psychological factor influencing growth in the market. While older women remain the primary customer base, adoption of preventive skin care regimen among women in the 20s and 30s age group to safeguard against premature aging is bringing younger consumers into the spotlight. Other major factors also influencing growth in the market include growing research in skin biology and new understanding into the regenerative potential of stem cells; emergence of probiotic skincare technology for visibly radiant and younger looking skin; innovation in anti-aging active ingredients such as hydroxypropyl tetrahydropyrantriol, salicyloyl phytosphingosine and anti-tyrosinase; and the rise of the “she-economy” comprising senior women aged over 50 with high net worth. The United States and Europe represent the largest markets worldwide. Asia-Pacific ranks as the fastest growing market with a CAGR of 6.3% over the analysis period led by factors such as aggressive retail marketing, rising health and beauty awareness, rising disposable incomes and increasing per capita spending on appearance maintenance cosmetic products among the growing base of affluent middle-class population (http://www.strategyr.com/MarketResearch/Anti_Aging_Products_Market_Trends.asp).
 
Hence, Umatrin is moving towards developing our own brand and anti-aging products. Recently we have developed a 100% natural anti-aging skin care series products under the brand “AKERO SECRET”. We have received lots of positive feedbacks on this new skin care series. GCI Magazine had reported that “In anti-aging and beauty trends, the desire for more natural ingredients is one of the fastest growing around the world. Zion Market Research has published a new report titled ”Anti-Aging Market (Baby Boomer, Generation X and Generation Y), by product (Botox, Anti-Wrinkle Products, Anti-Stretch Mark Products, and Others), by Services (Anti-Pigmentation Therapy, Anti-Adult Acne Therapy, Breast Augmentation, Liposuction, Chemical Peel, Hair Restoration Treatment, and Others), by Device (Microdermabrasion, Laser Aesthetics, Anti-Cellulite Treatment and Anti-Aging Radio Frequency Devices) : Global Industry Perspective, Comprehensive Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Segment, Trends and Forecast, 2015 – 2021”. According to the report, the global anti-aging market was valued at USD 140.3 billion in 2015, is expected to reach USD 216.52 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 7.5% between 2016 and 2021.
 
In view of the above, Umatrin does not stop right here, but aims at developing and manufacturing more anti-aging products to benefit the public enlarged. In order to achieve this, additional capital funds are required for Umatrin to venture into manufacturing industry and expanding further research and development to develop more and more quality products.
 
Competitive Analysis
 
Market Analysis
 
Asia is the Earth’s largest and most populous continent. It comprises 30% of Earth’s land area, and has historically been home to 60% of the planet’s human population (roughly 4.4 billion people reside in Asia). Asia is notable for not only the overall large size, but unusually dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions. Rising individual incomes and changing lifestyles drive the global beauty care products industry.
 
Lucintel, a leading global management consulting and market research firm, has analyzed the global beauty care industry and presents its findings in “Global Beauty Care Products Industry 2012-2017: Trend, Profit, and Forecast Analysis.” The industry encompasses manufacturers’ segment revenue related to beauty care products. As per the study, increased awareness has resulted in higher demand for luxury products, especially cosmetics. Providing quality products at a low cost is a challenge for manufacturers. Skincare, the largest segment, represents the growth in products during the forecast period. Increased demand for multi-feature products such as moisturizing cream with sun protection and anti-aging or anti-wrinkle properties are likely to drive market growth.
 
The cosmetics segment also has growth potential as demand is increasing for premium cosmetics in the expanding middle class in developing countries. 
 
Many famous companies sell their cosmetic products online also in countries where they do not have representatives. At present, cosmetics industry is focusing on launching organic cosmetic products because people are now becoming more and more conscious about the chemicals and the harmful effects in the cosmetics. Players are globally exploring the markets to tap the hidden growth potential. Regulatory bodies are also ensuring that consumers have full knowledge about the ingredients of products and hence focusing on labeling.
 
A new global anti-ageing report from Research and Markets, forecasts the global product market will grow at a CAGR of 6.7% over the period 2013-2018, with the rising global ageing population being the main driver. (www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com)

Competitors
 
The beauty and health industry is highly competitive and, at times, subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences and industry trends. Competition generally provides incentives to boost brand strength, assortment and continuity of merchandise selection, reliable order fulfillment and on-time delivery, and a higher level of brand support and customer support. We compete with a large number of multi-national manufacturers of beauty and health products, many of which have significantly greater resources than we do. Many of our competitors also have the ability to develop and market products similar to and competitive with our products. Specifically, we compete with the major skin care companies which market many brands including Avon, Chanel, Clarins, Clinique, Estée Lauder, L’Oréal, Lancôme, Neutrogena and Shiseido, major health supplement companies which market many brands including USANA, CVS, Nature Made and Carlson Labs. Most, if not all of these competitors, have launched anti-aging skin care products. We also compete with several smaller prestige boutique and designer anti-aging products brands.
 
We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of product differentiation, sales and marketing strategy and distribution model. We focus on anti-aging industry by introducing quality natural products to be consumed or applied on skins to naturally reach the ultimate results. In addition, we are moving forward to develop our innovative product formulation and differentiated product concepts. We believe that our expertise within the anti-aging industry, brand authenticity and loyal consumer base, and multi-channel marketing and distribution expertise provide us with competitive advantages in the market for prestige anti-aging beauty and health products.
 
Principal Methods of Competition
 
A core element of our success is our distinctive Online to Offline (O2O) marketing strategy and multi-channel distribution model. We focus on educating consumers about the unique benefits of our products, developing intimate relationships with consumers, capitalizing on our multi-channel distribution strategy to effectively reach and engage those consumers and allowing our consumers to enjoy the benefit to be profitable by sharing the same to other consumers. We believe educational media such as products introductory demo and continuous products roadshows are effective at informing consumers about the innovative product formulation, application technique and resulting benefits of our products. We also believe that our company-owned boutiques enhance the authenticity of our brand and provide a personal environment in which we offer our broadest product assortment and provide one-on-one consumer consultations and product demonstrations. At the same time, our physical presence at the event hosted by our dealers have helped to further strengthen our brand image and provide additional points of contact to educate consumers about our products. Moreover, this model allows us to:

· | acquire new consumers and maintain premium brand positioning without large expenditures on print-based advertising and marketing common in our industry; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | provide consumers the ability to select the most convenient channel to purchase our products; 
· | develop intimate consumer relationships that foster brand loyalty and encourage repeat purchases; 
· | build a base of recurring revenues as a substantial percentage of our consumers participate in our product continuity programs through which products initially purchased are automatically replenished; and
· | drive traffic across our sales channels. 

 
We believe that our company benefits from strong consumer loyalty as well as the emotional connection formed between our consumers and our brand. In turn, we believe that our consumers are strong advocates for our brand and have displayed a desire and willingness to convert others to our brand. Strong consumer loyalty has resulted in the development of a community of consumers who share a passion for our products and our brand. This community has expressed itself through attendance at events we sponsor, as well as events initiated by individual consumers. In addition, these loyal consumers have established multiple online community independent of the Company’s efforts. This loyal community of users provides invaluable feedback that we often incorporate into our product development.

As consumers continue to blend their off-line and on-line activities, from “showrooming” and retail apps to sofa shopping and click-and-collect, the lines between internet retailing, e-commerce and physical retailing are increasingly blurred. Big retailers are taking an “omni-channel” approach by merging their offline, on-line and mobile capabilities to create a seamless experience for shoppers. To elaborate, consumer behavior driving internet sales surge. E-commerce and m-commerce have changed the way that consumers’, even those who still visit physical stores, approach on shopping. The main drivers of e-commerce include: the search for value and convenience; increased access to, and usage of, the internet; faster download speeds; improved delivery and online payment methods; and the shift towards mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Hence, we will be co-operating with our partners to allow our consumer to purchase our products by just a click at their mobile devices apps.
 
We use third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain substantially all raw materials, components and packaging products and to manufacture finished some of products relating to our Umatrin and AKERO SECRET brands products. We utilize approximately 20 different product and packaging suppliers from which we source and contract manufacture our products. Suppliers purchase all necessary raw materials, including the natural ingredients used to manufacture our products.
 
With respect to our other third-party manufacturers, we make purchases through purchase orders. We believe that we have good relationships with our manufacturers and that there are alternative sources in the event that one or more of these manufacturers is not available. We continually review our manufacturing needs against the capacity of our contract manufacturers to ensure that we are able to meet our production goals, reduce costs, and operate more efficiently.
 
Research and Development
 
We previously invested approximately $19,500 for a third-party manufacturer to develop AKERO SECRET. We did not incur additional research and development expenses in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
