 Mercer
 General
 We are a global forest products company with two reportable operating segments being pulp and wood products. 
 We have consolidated annual production capacity of approximately 2.3 million ADMTs of kraft pulp, 550 MMfbm of lumber and approximately 416.5 MW of electrical generation.
 Pulp Segment
 Our pulp segment consists of the manufacture, sale and distribution of pulp, electricity and other by-products at our pulp mills.
 We are one of the world’s largest producers of “market” NBSK pulp, which is pulp that is sold on the open market. Our size provides us increased presence, better industry information in our markets and close customer relationships with many large pulp consumers. 
 We operate two modern and highly efficient NBSK mills in Eastern Germany and one NBSK mill and a “swing” kraft mill in Western Canada which produces both NBSK and NBHK. 
 (3)

We are the sole NBSK producer, and the only significant market pulp producer in Germany, which is the largest pulp import market in Europe. We supply the growing pulp demand in China both through our Canadian mills’ ready access to the Port of Vancouver and through our Stendal mill’s existing logistics arrangements. 
 In addition, as a result of the significant investments made in cogeneration equipment, all of our mills generate and sell a significant amount of surplus “green” energy. We also produce and sell tall oil, a by-product of our production process, which is used as both a chemical additive and as a green energy source.
 Of our consolidated annual production capacity of approximately 2.3 million ADMTs of kraft pulp, approximately 2.1 million ADMTs or 91% is NBSK and the balance is NBHK.
 Key operating details for each of our pulp mills are as follows:
  
• | Rosenthal mill. Our Rosenthal mill is a modern, efficient ISO 9001, 14001 and 50001 certified NBSK pulp mill that has an annual production capacity of approximately 360,000 ADMTs and 57 MW of electrical generation. The Rosenthal mill is located in the town of Rosenthal am Rennsteig, Germany, approximately 300 kilometers south of Berlin.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stendal mill. Our Stendal mill is a state-of-the-art, single line, ISO 9001, 14001 and 50001 certified NBSK pulp mill that has an annual production capacity of approximately 740,000 ADMTs and 148 MW of electrical generation. The Stendal mill is located near the town of Stendal, Germany, approximately 130 kilometers west of Berlin.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Celgar mill. Our Celgar mill is a modern, efficient ISO 9001 and 14001 certified NBSK pulp mill that has an annual production capacity of approximately 520,000 ADMTs and 100 MW of electrical generation. The Celgar mill is located near the city of Castlegar, British Columbia, Canada, approximately 600 kilometers east of Vancouver.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Peace River mill. Our Peace River mill is a modern ISO 9001 and 14001 certified mill that produces both NBSK and NBHK pulp and has an annual production capacity of approximately 475,000 ADMTs and 70 MW of electrical generation. The Peace River mill is located near the town of Peace River, Alberta, Canada, approximately 490 kilometers north of Edmonton. Peace River also holds two 20-year renewable governmental forest management agreements and three deciduous timber allocations in Alberta with an aggregate allowable annual cut of approximately 2.4 million cubic meters of hardwood and softwood allocations totaling 400,000 cubic meters. Through our Peace River mill, we have a 50% proportionate share of the annual production capacity of the Cariboo mill, which is approximately 170,000 ADMTs and 28.5 MW of electrical generation. The Cariboo mill is located in Quesnel, British Columbia, Canada, approximately 660 kilometers north of Vancouver.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our pulp mills are some of the newer and more modern pulp mills in Europe and North America. We believe the relative age, production capacity and electrical generation capacity of our mills provide us with certain manufacturing cost and other advantages over many of our competitors. We believe our competitors’ older mills do not have the equipment or capacity to produce or sell surplus power or chemicals in a meaningful amount. In addition, as a result of the relative age of our mills, they benefit from lower maintenance capital requirements and higher efficiency relative to many of our competitors’ mills.
 The following table sets out our pulp production and pulp revenues for the periods indicated:
 
 
 | Year Ended December 31, |

Pulp revenues (in thousands) | $ | 1,389,439 | | $ | 1,130,302 | | $ | 1,370,742

 We serve pulp customers in Europe, Asia and North America. We primarily work directly with customers to capitalize on our geographic diversity, coordinate sales and enhance customer relationships. We believe our ability to deliver high-quality pulp on a timely basis and our customer service makes us a preferred supplier for many customers.
 (4)

Our pulp mills generate and sell surplus electricity, providing us with a stable revenue source unrelated to pulp prices. Our German pulp mills also generate tall oil from black liquor, which is sold to third parties for use in numerous applications, including bio-fuels. Since our energy and chemical production are by-products of our pulp production process, there are minimal incremental costs and our surplus energy and chemical sales are highly profitable. All of our mills generate and sell surplus energy to regional utilities or the regional electrical market. Our Stendal and Friesau mills benefit from special tariffs under Germany’s Renewable Energy Sources Act, or the “Renewable Energy Act” and sell their surplus energy under such tariffs until 2024 and 2029, respectively. Our Rosenthal mill sells its surplus power at market rates which fluctuate over time. Our Peace River mill sells surplus energy to its regional electrical market. Our Celgar mill is party to a fixed electricity purchase agreement with the regional public utility provider for the sale of surplus power which runs until October 2030. 
 The following table sets out the amount of surplus energy we produced and sold and revenues from the sale of such surplus energy and chemicals in our pulp segment for the periods indicated:

----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wood Products Segment
 Our wood products segment consists of the manufacture, sale and distribution of lumber, electricity and other wood residuals at our Friesau mill. It is one of Germany's largest sawmills.
 Our Friesau mill has an annual production capacity of approximately 550 MMfbm of lumber and 13 MW of electrical generation from a modern biomass fueled cogeneration power plant built in 2009. The Friesau mill is located approximately 16 kilometers west of our Rosenthal mill and has historically been one of the Rosenthal mill’s largest fiber suppliers. 
 The mill produces lumber for European, U.S. and other lumber export markets.
 The European and U.S. lumber markets are very different. In the European market, lumber is generally customized in terms of dimensions and finishing. The U.S. market is driven primarily by demand from new housing starts and home renovation activities and dimensions and finishing are generally standardized.
 Additionally, lumber production and sales in Europe are commonly measured in cubic meters, whereas in the U.S. they are measured in thousand board feet or Mfbm.
 The following table sets out our lumber production and lumber revenues for the periods indicated: 
 
 
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
-------------------------------+-------------------------+--------
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | | 2019 |

Corporate Structure, History and Development of Business
 Mercer Inc. is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Washington whose common stock is quoted and listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (MERC).
 The following simplified chart sets out our principal operating subsidiaries, their jurisdictions of organization, their principal activities and their annual pulp or lumber production and electrical generation capacity: 


 
(1) | Includes 170,000 ADMTs and 28.5 MW based on Peace River’s 50% joint venture interest in the Cariboo mill.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We entered into the pulp business in 1994 by acquiring our Rosenthal mill and in 1999 converted it to the production of kraft pulp. In September 2004, we expanded our pulp operations by constructing the Stendal mill at a cost of approximately $1.1 billion. We further expanded our pulp operations by acquiring the Celgar mill in 2005 and the Peace River mill in 2018. 
 In April 2017, we entered into the wood products segment when we acquired the Friesau mill.
 In October 2018, we acquired the Santanol Group, which operates Indian sandalwood plantations and an oil extractives plant in Australia. 
 In August 2021, we acquired a cross-laminated timber facility referred to as the “CLT Facility” located near Spokane, Washington, for approximately $51.3 million. The facility is a state-of-the-art, near-new facility that produces cross-laminated timber, or “CLT”, for use in construction and home building. It has a capacity of approximately 140,000 cubic meters of CLT. We believe it is one of the largest CLT facilities in North America and that it currently represents approximately 30% of North American manufacturing capacity. CLT is a wood panel product, made from adhering layers of solid-sawn lumber and is used as a more sustainable alternative to steel and concrete in building projects. We are currently ramping up the operations of the CLT Facility. Currently, its results are reflected in our financial results in “Corporate and Other Revenues”.

Corporate Strategy
 
Our corporate strategy is to grow in businesses where we have clear competencies while maintaining modern facilities and managing the integrity of our balance sheet and liquidity, with a high standard of environmental, social and governance performance. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Operate World Class Assets. The maintenance of modern, reliable and energy efficient operations is key to our ability to produce stable returns through the economic cycle. The markets for our principal products are cyclical and subject to global economic influences. Further, our manufacturing operations are capital intensive and complex. Maintaining a high standard of maintenance and strategic capital expenditure programs differentiates us from older, higher cost, lower efficiency competitors. We believe that over time this will reduce our exposure to product price volatility, unexpected downtime and changes in environmental and regulatory conditions. We operate four modern pulp mills and one of the most modern sawmills in the world. In 2021, the majority of our capital expenditures focused on projects to increase production and operational efficiency and reduce costs. Additionally, we continuously strive to enhance our maintenance systems to improve and increase production by improving reliability. We also seek to reduce operating costs by better managing our fiber procurement, sales, marketing and logistics activities. We believe this continued focus on operational excellence enhances our profitability and cash flows.

• | Growth and Diversification Where We Have Core Competencies. We are focused on growth in areas where we have a clear leadership position or high degree of competence to ensure that we can add value for shareholders. We believe that a larger company will benefit shareholders in terms of improved equity trading, liquidity and reduced variability of earnings. Our core competencies lend themselves to growth in one or more of the following areas: 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Pulp. The core of our business is NBSK pulp. We are one of the largest producers of market NBSK in the world and have deep expertise and a market reputation as a reliable, efficient and high quality producer. We believe that the global demand for kraft pulp will continue to grow and that the supply of fiber to meet that demand is limited.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Wood Products. We have significant expertise in forestry and wood procurement services and have utilized that expertise and our logistics networks in support of our pulp operations. In 2017, we began leveraging this foundation into the solid wood products business with the acquisition of the Friesau sawmill which is one of the world’s largest and most flexible sawmills. The mill created synergies with our wood procurement and pulp businesses. In 2021, we completed a three-year upgrade to the Friesau mill that we believe has made it one of the most technologically advanced and largest sawmills in the world. Further expansion into the wood products business is a key focus for us and we believe it will create more value for shareholders over time. In furtherance of this strategy, in 2021 we acquired the CLT Facility.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Green Energy. Our modern, highly efficient mills allow us to produce green, cogenerated electricity. Our mills are all self-sufficient in power and net exporters of electricity and our power is sold to regional utilities or the regional market. We are very experienced at building and operating cogeneration facilities and we have increased our electricity production by 12% since 2012.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Wood Extractives. We believe that we are very well positioned to fully extract all of the value from wood including those elements that were traditionally wasted or burned. We have applied considerable resources to manufacturing products such as tall oil, which is upgraded by our customers and used in adhesives and bio-fuels that are displacing fossil fuel based alternatives. We are also expanding our production of turpentine for use in aromatics and fragrances. We also acquired sandalwood plantations and an essential sandalwood oil extraction and sales business to further develop such operations and move closer to the end customer. We are also focused on researching and commercializing other complex and novel products based on wood and have established various partnerships and working relationships to advance these products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Sustainable Operations. We seek to meet best in class standards in environmental performance, social conditions and governance (often referred to as “ESG” standards). We believe that sustainably-focused businesses can flourish if they align themselves with societal objectives, and that the diminishing tolerance of stakeholders for under-performing companies in regards to sustainability will lead to their decline. Further, we believe that our products, which are renewable wood-based fiber, carbon sequestering solid wood products, green energy and naturally sourced wood extractives, are becoming more important for a world seeking to limit its reliance on fossil fuel-based products. We will continue to grow these products, enhance our environmental performance and stakeholder engagement and maintain strong governance and ethical business practices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Managing the Integrity of our Balance Sheet and Liquidity. We focus on maintaining a balance sheet that allows us to advance our objectives through the full economic cycle, while at the same time, giving us some flexibility to take advantage of strategic growth opportunities as they arise. We maintain a foundation of long term, unsecured, senior notes with maturity dates in 2026 and beyond. In addition to cash on hand, we have a series of revolving credit facilities intended to provide liquidity and flexibility in times of opportunity or economic slowdown. We commenced a dividend in 2015 and remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through the economic cycle.

The Pulp Industry
 General
 Pulp is used in the production of paper, tissues and paper-related products. Pulp is generally classified according to fiber type, the process used in its production and the degree to which it is bleached. Kraft pulp, a type of chemical pulp, is produced through a sulphate chemical process in which lignin, the component of wood which binds individual fibers, is dissolved in a chemical reaction. Chemically prepared pulp allows the wood’s fiber to retain its length and flexibility, resulting in stronger paper products. Kraft pulp can be bleached to increase its brightness. Softwood kraft pulp is noted for its strength, brightness and absorption properties and is used to produce a variety of products, including lightweight publication grades of paper, tissues and other paper-related products.
 There are two main types of bleached kraft pulp, being softwood kraft made from coniferous trees and hardwood kraft made from deciduous trees. Softwood species generally have long, flexible fibers which add strength to paper while fibers from species of hardwood contain shorter fibers which lend bulk and opacity.
 We primarily produce and sell NBSK pulp, which is a bleached kraft pulp manufactured using northern softwood and is considered a premium grade because of its strength. It generally obtains the highest price relative to other kraft pulps. Our Peace River mill produces both NBSK and NBHK pulp. 
 Most paper users of market kraft pulp use a mix of softwood and hardwood grades to optimize production and product qualities. In 2021, market kraft pulp consumption was approximately 57% hardwood bleached kraft and 39% softwood bleached kraft, with the remainder comprised of unbleached pulp. Over the last several years, production of hardwood pulp, based on fast growing plantation fiber primarily from Asia and South America, has increased much more rapidly than that of softwood grades, because of longer growth cycles. Hardwood kraft generally has a cost advantage over softwood kraft as a result of lower fiber costs, higher wood yields and, for newer hardwood mills, economies of scale. As a result of this growth in supply and lower costs, kraft pulp customers have substituted some of the pulp content in their products to hardwood pulp.
 However, the requirement for strength and formation characteristics in finished goods counters customers’ ability to substitute cheaper hardwood pulp for NBSK. Paper and tissue makers focus on larger paper machines with higher speeds and lower basis weights for certain papers which require the strength characteristics of softwood pulp. Additionally, where paper products are lightweight or specialized, like direct mail, magazine paper or premium tissue, or where strength or absorbency are important, softwood kraft forms a significant proportion of the fiber used. As a result, we believe that the ability of kraft pulp users to further substitute hardwood for softwood pulp is limited by such requirements.
 (8)

Kraft pulp can be made in different grades, with varying technical specifications, for different end uses. Softwood kraft pulp is an important ingredient for tissue manufacturing and tissue demand tends to increase with living standards in developing countries. Softwood kraft pulp is also valued for its reinforcing role in mechanical printing papers and is sought after by producers of paper for the publishing industry, primarily for magazines and advertising materials. 
 Markets
 We believe that over 145 million ADMTs of chemical pulp are converted annually into tissues, printing and writing papers, carton boards and other specialty grades of paper and paperboard around the world. We also believe that approximately 45% of this pulp is sold on the open market as market pulp, while the remainder is produced for internal purposes by integrated paper and paperboard manufacturers.
 The pulp business is highly cyclical in nature and markets are characterized by periods of supply and demand imbalance, which in turn affect prices. Pulp markets are highly competitive and are sensitive to cyclical changes in the global economy, industry capacity and foreign exchange rates, all of which can have a significant influence on selling prices and our operating results. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time but generally reflect changes in macro-economic conditions and levels of industry capacity. Pulp is a commodity that is generally available from other producers. Because commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer, competition is generally based upon price, which is generally determined by supply relative to demand.
 Between 2012 and 2021, worldwide demand for chemical market pulp overall for such period grew at an average rate of approximately 2% annually, with worldwide demand for bleached softwood kraft market pulp having grown at an average of approximately 1% per annum.
 The following chart illustrates the global demand for chemical market pulp for the periods indicated:
 Estimated Global Chemical Market Pulp Demand

(9)


NBSK pulp demand is significantly impacted by global macro-economic trends. 
 Over the last several years there have been several key macro trends that have had a material effect on global pulp demand. Some of the trends have had a positive effect while others have had a negative effect on pulp demand.
 A major positive macro trend has been a marked increase in demand from emerging markets, and in particular China. In China alone, tissue production capacity has increased by approximately 7.7 million ADMTs over the last five years. In China, imports of chemical softwood market pulp grew overall by approximately 6% per annum for the period from 2012 to 2021 and it is a key driver of pulp demand and consumption. We believe the emerging markets now account for approximately 58% of total global demand for bleached softwood kraft market pulp and China itself now accounts for approximately 33% of global bleached softwood kraft market pulp demand compared to approximately 28% in 2012. 
 Another positive macro trend affecting pulp demand has been the increase in usage and demand for tissue and hygiene products, particularly in China and emerging markets generally. This trend was further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. A further positive trend affecting pulp demand was an increase in the global reliance on online delivery of products which has increased demand for packaging and specialty products.
 An important negative in pulp demand has been the material decline in graphic and printing and writing paper demand. We believe a material portion of this decline will not return.
 Further, paper demand in mature markets of North America, Europe and Japan has been declining or stagnating, which negatively impacts pulp demand in those markets. Western Europe currently accounts for approximately 22% of global bleached softwood kraft market pulp demand compared to approximately 28% in 2012.
 The following chart reflects NBSK pulp deliveries to China for the periods indicated:

(10)


The trends and changes in NBSK pulp demand by end use are reflected in the following chart which compares worldwide NBSK pulp demand by end use for the periods indicated: NBSK Pulp Demand by End Use

We believe 2021 NBSK demand by end use was generally consistent with the trend in the chart above.
 In 2021, there was an increase in pulp capacity of 2.8 million ADMTs, primarily of hardwood kraft pulp. Currently, we are aware of 2.9 million ADMTs of announced capacity increases primarily of hardwood kraft pulp in 2022. 
NBSK Pulp Pricing
 Kraft pulp is a globally traded commodity and prices are highly cyclical. Kraft pulp prices are generally quoted in dollars. Pricing is primarily influenced by the balance between supply and demand, as affected by global macro-economic conditions, changes in consumption and capacity, the level of customer and producer inventories and fluctuations in exchange rates. Generally, we and other producers consider global NBSK pulp supply and demand to be evenly balanced when world inventory levels are at about 32 days’ supply.
 As the majority of market NBSK pulp is produced and sold by Canadian and Northern European producers, while the price of NBSK pulp is generally quoted in dollars, pricing is often affected by fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for the dollar versus the euro and the Canadian dollar. As NBSK pulp producers generally incur costs in their local currency, while pulp is quoted in dollars, a dollar strengthening generally benefits producers’ businesses and operating margins. Conversely, a weakening of the dollar versus the local currency of producers generally adversely affects producers’ businesses and operating margins.
 As a corollary to changes in exchange rates between the dollar and the euro and Canadian dollar, a stronger dollar generally increases costs to customers of NBSK pulp producers and results in downward pressure on prices. Conversely, a weakening dollar generally supports higher pulp pricing. However, there is invariably a time lag between changes in currency exchange rates and pulp prices. This lag can vary and is not predictable with any certainty.
 Although China is now the largest market globally for pulp, Northern Europe has also historically been a significant market. As NBSK pulp is a premium grade of pulp, the European market NBSK list price is at times used by the industry as a benchmark reference price. The third party industry quoted average European list prices for NBSK pulp since 2012 have fluctuated between a low of approximately $760 per ADMT in 2012 and a high of $1,345 per ADMT in 2021.
 (11)

The following chart sets out the changes in third party industry quoted list prices for NBSK pulp in Europe, as stated in dollars, Canadian dollars and euros for the periods indicated:
 NBSK Pulp Price History (European Delivery)

Our pulp sales realizations in Europe and North America are third party industry quoted list prices, net of customer discounts, rebates and other selling concessions. Our sales to China and Asia generally are closer to a net price with significantly lower or little discounts and rebates. As a result, our net sales realizations in China are generally similar to other markets.

 Pulp Price and Global Inventory History


Seasonality
 We are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors. These factors are common in the kraft pulp industry. We generally have weaker pulp demand in China in the period relating to the lunar new year and in Europe during the summer holiday months. We typically have a seasonal build-up in raw material inventories in the early winter months as our mills build up their fiber supply for the winter when there is reduced availability.
Competition
 The pulp market is highly fragmented and competitive with many producers competing globally. Producers ranging from small independent manufacturers to large integrated companies produce pulp worldwide. Pulp is generally a commodity product and our pulp competes with similar products manufactured and distributed by many other producers. While many factors influence our competitive position, particularly in weak economic times, a primary factor is price. Other factors include quality, service, access to reasonably priced fiber and convenience of location. Some of our competitors are larger than we are in certain markets and have substantially greater financial resources. These resources may afford those competitors more purchasing power, increased financial flexibility, more capital resources for expansion and improvement and enable them to compete more effectively. 
 Our key NBSK pulp competitors are principally located in Northern Europe and Canada and include Metsä Fibre, Södra Cell, Ilim, Paper Excellence, Canfor Pulp, and SCA.

Generation and Sales of Green Energy and Chemicals
 General
 Our pulp mills are large scale bio-refineries that, in addition to pulp, also produce surplus “carbon neutral” or green energy. As part of the pulp production process, our mills generate green energy using carbon neutral bio-fuels such as black liquor and wood waste. Through the incineration of bio-fuels in the recovery and power boilers, our mills produce sufficient steam to cover all of our steam requirements and allow us to produce surplus electricity which we sell to third-party utilities or into the regional electricity market. As a result, we have benefited from green energy legislation, incentives and commercialization that have developed over the last decades in Europe and Canada. In addition, in recent years we have applied considerable resources to increasing our capacity to produce and sell chemicals, primarily tall oil for use in numerous applications including bio-fuels.
 Our Friesau mill also generates and sells green energy produced from its biomass cogeneration power plant.
 Our surplus energy and chemical sales provide us with a stable revenue source unrelated to pulp or lumber prices. Since our energy and chemical production are by-products of our production processes, there are minimal incremental costs and our surplus energy and chemical sales are highly profitable. We believe that this revenue source gives our mills a competitive advantage over other older mills which do not have the equipment or capacity to produce and/or sell surplus power and/or chemicals in a meaningful amount.

Germany
 Until December 31, 2020, all of our German mills participated in a program established pursuant to the Renewable Energy Act, which provides for stable pricing on green energy. As of January 1, 2021, the prior special tariff in respect of our Rosenthal mill expired and it has since sold its surplus power at market rates which fluctuate over time. The special tariff for our Stendal mill is in effect until December 31, 2024 and for our Friesau mill until 2029.
 In 2021, energy sales for our German pulp mills and the Friesau mill were approximately $82.4 million or 616,033 MWh.
 In connection with our focus on the growing bio-energy market, we sell tall oil, a by-product of our pulp production process which is used as both a chemical additive and as a green energy source. In 2021, we generated approximately $7.3 million from the sale of tall oil and other chemicals from our pulp segment.
 Canada
 Our Celgar mill is party to an electricity sales agreement with the provincial energy utility for a ten-year term that expires in October 2030. Pursuant to the agreement, the mill agreed to supply a maximum of approximately 127,000 MWh of surplus electrical energy annually to the utility. We are pursuing “market” sales and other strategic initiatives with respect to the remainder of the mill’s surplus power. 
 The Peace River mill sells its surplus electricity into the Alberta market. 
 In 2021, our Canadian mills sold approximately 160,586 MWh of renewable electricity for proceeds of approximately $15.5 million.
 (15)

Production Costs
 Our major costs of pulp production are fiber, labor, chemicals and energy. 
 Fiber
 General
 Fiber, comprised of wood chips and pulp logs, is our most significant operating expense for our pulp segment, representing about 45% of our pulp cash production costs in 2021. Further, fiber, in the form of sawlogs, represents about 75% of lumber cash production costs in 2021.
 Given the significance of fiber to our total operating expenses and our limited ability to control its cost compared with our other operating costs, volatility in fiber costs can materially affect our margins and results of operations.
 Our mills are situated in regions which generally provide a relatively stable supply of fiber. The fiber consumed by our pulp mills consists of wood chips produced by sawmills as a by-product of the sawmilling process and pulp logs. Wood chips are small pieces of wood used to make pulp and are either wood residuals from the sawmilling process or pulp logs chipped especially for this purpose. Pulp logs consist of lower quality logs not used in the production of lumber. The Friesau mill consumes sawlogs and waste wood, which are cyclical in both price and supply.
 Generally, the cost of wood chips, pulp logs and sawlogs is primarily affected by the supply and demand for lumber. Additionally, regional factors including harvesting levels, weather conditions and insect infestations can also have a material effect on the supply, demand and price for fiber.
 While fiber costs and supply are subject to cyclical changes, we expect that we will be able to continue to obtain an adequate supply of fiber on reasonably satisfactory terms for our mills due to their locations and our long-term relationships with suppliers. We have not historically experienced any significant fiber supply interruptions for our operations.
 During the past few years, certain customers have endeavored to purchase pulp that is produced using fiber that meets certain recognized wood certification requirements from forest certification agencies like the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) and the Canadian Standards Association (CSA). If the fiber we purchase does not meet certain wood certifications required by customers, it may make it more difficult to, or prevent us from, selling our pulp to such customers. The chain of custody wood certification process is a voluntary process which allows a company to demonstrate that they use forest resources in accordance with strict principles and standards in the areas of sustainable forest management practices and environmental management. In an effort to procure wood only from sustainably managed sources, we employ an FSC Chain of Custody protocol and PEFC certification, which requires tracking of fiber origins and preparing risk based assessments regarding the region and operator. In the areas where we operate, we are actively engaged in the further development of certification processes. However, there is competition among private certification systems along with efforts by supporters to further these systems by having customers of forest products require products to be certified to their preferred system. Such wood certification standards continue to evolve and are not consistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction or how they are interpreted and applied. We currently do not expect certification requirements to have a material adverse impact on our fiber procurement and sales. However, if sufficient marketplace demand requires wood raw materials to be sourced from standards that are inconsistent with those in our fiber supply regions, it could increase our operating costs and available harvest levels.
 Germany
 We believe we are the largest consumer of wood chips and pulp logs in Germany and often provide the best long-term economic outlet for the sale of wood chips in Eastern Germany. We coordinate the wood procurement activities for our German mills to reduce overall personnel and administrative costs, provide greater purchasing power and coordinate buying and trading activities. This coordination and integration of fiber flows also allows us to optimize transportation costs, and the species and fiber mix for our mills. We are also party to a joint wood purchasing arrangement with one of the largest wood consumers in Europe.
 
(16)


In 2021 our German pulp mills consumed an aggregate of approximately 4.9 million cubic meters of fiber. Approximately 58% was in the form of pulp logs and approximately 42% was in the form of sawmill wood chips.
 In 2021, our per unit pulp fiber costs in Germany decreased compared to 2020, primarily as a result of the availability of beetle damaged wood and strong sawmill production. 
 Our Rosenthal mill sources wood chips from approximately 27 sawmills located primarily in the German states of Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg and Thuringia and primarily within a 300 kilometer radius of the Rosenthal mill. Within this radius, the Rosenthal mill is the largest consumer of wood chips. Given its location and size, the Rosenthal mill is often the best economic outlet for the sale of wood chips in the area. In 2021, approximately 90% of the fiber consumed by the Rosenthal mill was spruce and the remainder was pine. Wood chips for the Rosenthal mill are normally sourced from sawmills under one-year contracts with quarterly adjustments for market pricing. Substantially all of our chip supply is sourced from suppliers with which we have long-standing relationships. Pulp logs are sourced from the state forest agencies in Thuringia, Saxony and Bavaria and from private and municipal forest owners. In addition, the Rosenthal mill buys relevant volumes via imports from the Czech Republic.
 The core wood supply region for the Stendal mill includes most of the Northeastern and Western part of Germany, primarily within an approximate 400 kilometer radius of the mill. We also purchase wood chips from Southwestern and Southern Germany as well as the Baltic Sea region. The fiber consumed by the Stendal mill consisted of approximately 63% spruce, 35% pine and 2% other species in 2021. The Stendal mill has sufficient chipping capacity to almost fully operate solely using pulp logs, if required. We source pulp logs from private and municipal forest owners and from state forest agencies. Our Stendal mill has historically also imported fiber from Poland and the Baltic Sea region.
 Our Friesau mill is dependent on the consistent supply of sawlog fiber. Wood fiber is the single largest input cost and accounts for about 75% of its cash costs of producing lumber in 2021. Our Friesau mill is located in an area where there is a significant amount of high-quality fiber within economic reach. The wood fiber requirements of the Friesau mill are met primarily through open market purchases and contract purchases from state forestry agencies and private and municipal forest owners.
 In Germany, over the last several years, the price and supply of wood chips has been affected from time to time by increasing demand from alternative or renewable energy producers and government initiatives for carbon neutral energy. In 2021, increasing energy prices and a stronger economy increased the demand for wood chips resulting from initiatives by European governments to promote the use of wood as a carbon neutral energy. 
 Offsetting some of the increases in demand for wood fiber have been initiatives to increase harvest levels in Germany, particularly from small private forest owners whose forests have been harvested at rates much lower than their rate of growth. 
 Additionally, over the last three years, there has been a material increase in the availability of harvestable wood as a result of beetle infestation of German forests. Generally, beetle-infested wood is harvested more rapidly so as to be useable before deterioration makes the wood unsuitable for its intended purposes. Most of such beetle-infested wood has now been harvested and processed. While such beetle-infested wood can increase fiber supply and lead to lower prices in the short-term, such increased harvest levels can lead to challenges in maintaining a sustainable harvest level over the long-term and can lead to periods of reduced harvest levels in the future.
 We believe that Germany has the highest availability of softwood forests in Europe suitable for harvesting and manufacturing. 
 Canada
 In 2021, our Celgar and Peace River mills consumed approximately 4.1 million cubic meters of fiber. Approximately 66% of such fiber was in the form of sawmill wood chips and the remaining 34% came from pulp logs processed through their woodrooms or chipped by a third-party. Our Canadian mills’ woodrooms are able to process about 24% of their fiber needs. The source of fiber at the mill is characterized by a mixture of species (aspen, spruce, pine, hemlock, douglas fir and cedar) and the mill sources fiber from a number of Canadian and U.S. suppliers.
 (17)

In 2021, our Canadian pulp mills’ per unit fiber costs modestly increased compared to 2020, due to the negative impact of a weaker dollar on our Canadian dollar denominated fiber costs. 
The availability of fiber for our mills is in large part influenced by the strength of the lumber market. Lumber markets are primarily driven by U.S. housing starts, home renovation activities and, to a lesser degree, demand from China. 
 In 2021, our Canadian mills had access to over 30 different chip suppliers, most of whom are in Canada and, in the case of the Celgar mill, are also in the United States. Chips are purchased in Canada and the United States in accordance with chip purchase agreements. Generally, pricing is reviewed and adjusted periodically to reflect market conditions. The contracts for the Celgar mill are generally for one year with quarterly adjustments or on three-month terms. The chip contracts for Peace River are generally for three to five years with monthly adjustments indexed to the average pulp price.
 To secure the volume of pulp logs required by its woodroom and field chippers, the Celgar mill has entered into pulp log supply agreements. Such agreements can range from three-month to one-year terms, with a number of different suppliers, many of whom are also contract chip suppliers for the mill. All of the pulp log agreements can be terminated by either party for any reason, upon seven days’ written notice. The Celgar mill also bids on British Columbia timber sales from time to time. 
 Peace River holds two 20-year renewable governmental forest management agreements and three deciduous timber allocations in Alberta with an aggregate allowable annual cut of approximately 2.4 million cubic meters of hardwood, of which it currently harvests approximately 44%, and 400,000 cubic meters of softwood, which it sells or trades to sawmills surrounding the Peace River mill in exchange for wood chips. The forest management agreements were last renewed for a 20-year term expiring in 2029. While our Peace River mill can satisfy all of its hardwood fiber requirements from its forest management agreements and timber allocations, in order to optimize its fiber flow, it satisfies a small portion of its needs from third-party owned timberlands. Softwood fiber supply is from residual sawmill chips from local surrounding sawmills. 
 Labor
 Our labor costs have increased over time due to inflation in wages and health care costs. 
 Energy
 Our energy is primarily generated from renewable carbon neutral sources, such as black liquor and wood waste. Our mills produce all of our energy requirements and generate excess energy which we sell to third-party utilities and to regional markets. We utilize fossil fuels, such as natural gas, primarily in our lime kilns and we use a limited amount for start-up and shut-down operations. Additionally, from time to time, mill process disruptions occur and we consume small quantities of purchased electricity and fossil fuels to maintain operations. As a result, all of our mills are subject to fluctuations in the prices for fossil fuels.
Chemicals
 Our pulp mills use certain chemicals which are generally available from several suppliers and sourcing is primarily based upon pricing and location. Our chemical costs have increased in recent years.
 (18)

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
Our global sales and marketing group is responsible for conducting all sales and marketing of the pulp produced at our mills and currently has approximately 25 employees. This group largely handles all European and North American sales directly. Sales to Asia are made directly or through commission agents overseen by our sales group. The global sales and marketing group handles sales to over 250 customers. We coordinate and integrate the sales and marketing activities of our German mills to realize on a number of synergies between them. These include reduced overall administrative and personnel costs and coordinated selling, marketing and transportation activities. We also coordinate pulp sales across our mills on a global basis, thereby providing our larger customers with seamless service across all major geographies. In marketing our pulp, we seek to establish long-term relationships by providing a competitively priced, high-quality, consistent product and excellent service. In accordance with customary practice, we maintain long-standing relationships with our customers, pursuant to which we periodically reach agreements on specific volumes and prices.
 Our lumber sales are handled by our sales teams in Germany and Vancouver. We also sell lumber through commissioned agents in certain markets.

The following charts set out the geographic distribution of our lumber revenues as a percentage of our total lumber revenues for the periods indicated: 

Our pulp and lumber sales are on customary industry terms. As of December 31, 2021, we had no material payment delinquencies. In 2021 and 2020, no customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues. We do not believe our pulp or lumber sales are dependent upon the activities of any single customer and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on us.
 Transportation
 We transport our pulp and lumber generally by truck, rail and ocean carriers through third-party carriers. We have a small fleet of trucks in Germany that deliver some of our German mills’ pulp.
 Our German pulp mills are currently the only market kraft pulp producers in Germany, which is the largest import market for kraft pulp in Europe. We therefore have a competitive transportation cost advantage compared to Canadian and Northern European pulp producers when shipping to customers in Europe. Due to the location of our German mills, we are able to deliver pulp to many of our customers primarily by truck and rail. 
 (20)

Our Canadian mills’ pulp is transported to customers by truck, rail and ocean carrier to ensure timely delivery. The majority of our Canadian mills’ pulp for overseas markets is initially delivered primarily by rail to the Port of Vancouver for shipment overseas by ocean carrier. Based in Western Canada, our Canadian mills are well positioned to service Asian customers. The majority of our Canadian mills’ pulp for domestic markets is shipped by rail directly to the customer or to third-party warehouses in the United States. We also operate a logistics and reload center near Trail, British Columbia to provide us with additional warehouse space and greater transportation flexibility in terms of access to rail and trucking options.
 The Friesau mill’s lumber is transported to customers by truck, rail and ocean carriers through third-party carriers.
 In each of 2021 and 2020, outbound transportation costs comprised approximately 12% and 13%, respectively, of our total consolidated costs and expenses. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We have continued to make capital investments designed to increase pulp, green energy and chemical production, reduce costs and improve efficiency and environmental performance at our pulp mills. The improvements made over the years have increased the competitive position of our pulp segment. Since its acquisition, we have also made capital investments to optimize sawmill production at the Friesau mill.
 The following table sets out the total capital expenditures by segment (excluding any related governmental grants) for the periods indicated:
 
 
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
----------------------+-------------------------+--------
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 
 | (in thousands) | 
Pulp segment | $ | 139,312 | (1) | $ | 53,751

(1) | Includes expenditures for the recovery boiler rebuild at the Peace River mill which is financed with insurance proceeds of $21.5 million.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In our pulp segment, capital investments at our Rosenthal mill in 2021 and 2020 primarily related to wastewater improvement and maintenance projects. 
 Capital investments at the Stendal mill in 2021 primarily related to capacity expansion projects. In 2020, they primarily related to capacity expansion, land for fiber storage and maintenance projects. 
 Capital investments at the Celgar mill in 2021 primarily related to upgrades to the woodroom and maintenance projects. In 2020, they primarily related to fiber consumption improvement projects and maintenance projects. 
 Capital investments at the Peace River mill in 2021 primarily related to the recovery boiler rebuild, which was financed with insurance proceeds of $21.5 million and upgrades to the woodroom. In 2020, they primarily related to large maintenance projects. 
 In our wood products segment, in 2021, we completed expansion and optimization projects at the Friesau mill to, among other things, increase annual lumber production and improve production grade capabilities and efficiencies. 
 Qualifying capital investments at industrial facilities in Germany that reduce pollutants in the effluent discharge offset wastewater fees that would otherwise be required to be paid. For more information about our environmental capital expenditures, see “– Environmental”.
 In 2022, excluding amounts being financed through government grants and expected insurance proceeds, we currently expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $175.0 million to $200.0 million.
 In 2022, we currently expect our capital expenditures in our pulp segment to be principally comprised of upgrades to the woodrooms at our Canadian mills, production improvement projects at our German pulp mills and maintenance projects. 
 (21)

In 2022, we currently expect capital expenditures in our wood products segment to be for further upgrades to our Friesau mill’s sorter line and other production improvement projects and maintenance projects.
 Innovation
 We utilize our expertise with wood, its processing and by-products to expand our product mix. As a result, we seek to develop new products based on our expertise in wood processing and working with derivatives of the kraft pulping process. Currently these processes are focused on:

• | the production and sale of CLT at our recently-acquired CLT Facility;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the further refinement of materials contained in black liquor, the extractive chemical and lignin containing compounds that are a result of the kraft pulping process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the further refinement of cellulose materials that are currently the basis of pulp; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | higher use products that may be derived from wood and plant processing and harvesting including oils from sandalwood trees and plants.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are working on some of these initiatives on our own, with others and in conjunction with industry associations or joint venture partners. We are also researching potential higher use products that may be derived from processing different species of trees and plants. 
 Environmental
 Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations, dealing primarily with:
  
• | air, water and land;
--+---------------------


• | solid and hazardous waste management;
--+--------------------------------------


• | waste disposal;
--+----------------


• | remediation and contaminated sites; and
--+----------------------------------------


• | chemical usage.
--+----------------

 Compliance with these laws and regulations generally involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs. We cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws and regulations or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed, have not become final or definitive or may be amended in the future. In addition, it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects.
 We devote significant management and financial resources to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. In particular, the operation of our plants is subject to permits, authorizations and approvals and we must comply with prescribed emission limits. Compliance with these requirements is monitored by local authorities and non-compliance may result in administrative orders, fines or closures of the non-compliant mill. Our total capital expenditures on environmental projects at our mills were approximately $8.4 million in 2021 and approximately $2.3 million in 2020. In 2022, capital expenditures for environmental projects are expected to be approximately $10.6 million.
 Environmental responsibility is a priority for our operations. To ensure compliance with environmental laws and regulations, we regularly monitor emissions at our mills and periodically perform environmental audits of operational sites and procedures both with our internal personnel and outside consultants. These audits identify opportunities for improvement and allow us to take proactive measures at the mills as considered appropriate.
 We believe we have obtained all required environmental permits, authorizations and approvals for our operations. We believe our operations are currently in material compliance with the requirements of all applicable environmental laws and regulations and our respective operating permits.
 Under German state environmental rules relating to effluent discharges, industrial users are required to pay wastewater fees based upon the amount of pollutants they discharge in their effluent. These rules also provide that an industrial user who undertakes environmental capital expenditures and lowers certain effluent pollutants to prescribed levels may offset the amount of these expenditures against the wastewater fees that they would otherwise be required to pay. We expect capital investment programs and other environmental initiatives at our German mills 
 (22)

will continue to offset the wastewater fees that are payable and we believe they will ensure that our operations continue in substantial compliance with prescribed standards.
 In Canada, in addition to existing provincial air quality regulations, an air quality management system, referred to as “AQMS”, outlines a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in Canada. Under the AQMS, all levels of government are to work collaboratively to respond to different air quality challenges across the country. The AQMS includes four elements:
  
• | Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS), meant to drive local air quality improvements. They provide the basis for provincial territorial governments to determine the level of action needed.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A framework for regional and local air quality management through air zones and regional airsheds.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Base-level Industrial Emissions Requirements (BLIERs) for certain major industries.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An intergovernmental working group to improve collaboration and reduce emissions from mobile sources (i.e. sources such as in-use cars and trucks).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2016, Environment Canada released the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. The framework put in place a national, sector-based greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries. In addition, the various provincial governments, including British Columbia and Alberta, have introduced legislation with the intention of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
 British Columbia has, for example, introduced a carbon tax and low-carbon fuel standards. British Columbia has also implemented performance standards, such as greenhouse gas emissions benchmarks for select industrial facilities and sectors, and new greenhouse gas emissions reporting regulations for certain industrial operations. British Columbia has also established greenhouse gas emission offset projects.
 In 2019, the federal government began phasing in a federal carbon tax pricing system in provinces and territories without a provincial carbon tax program. As of January 1, 2022, the federal carbon tax pricing system applies to Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta, as well as the territories of Nunavut and the Yukon.
 We believe that these water and air emission measures in Germany and Canada have not had, and in 2022 will not have, a significant effect on our operations. Although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future, we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations. We also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations.
 Future regulations or permits may place lower limits on allowable types of emissions, including air, water, waste and hazardous materials, and may increase the financial consequences of maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations or conducting remediation. Our ongoing monitoring and policies have enabled us to develop and implement effective measures to maintain emissions in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations to date in a cost-effective manner. However, there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future.
 Climate Change
 Changing weather patterns and climatic conditions due to natural and man-made causes have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, wildfires and wind, rain, hail, snow and ice storms. Such changes and resulting conditions can adversely affect our operations, resulting in variations in the cost and availability of raw materials, such as fiber, unplanned downtime, changes in operating rates and disruptions in transportation and logistics. For example, in 2021, significant wildfires and later flooding in Western Canada disrupted and reduced harvesting activities and fiber supply and logistics and transportation.
 As there is uncertainty about the severity, extent and speed at which climate change is occurring, we are unable to identify and predict all of the consequences of climate change and the timing of the same on our business and operations.
 The effects and perceived effects of climate change and social and governmental responses have created both opportunities and negative consequences for our business.
 (23)

The focus on climate change has generated a substantial increase in demand and in legislative requirements for carbon neutral or green energy. Pulp mills consume wood residuals, being wood chips and pulp logs, as the base raw material for their production process. Wood chips are residuals left over from lumber production and pulp logs are generally lower quality logs left over from logging that are unsuitable for the production of lumber. Sawmills consume sawlogs and residuals, like wood chips, are generally sold to other industrial consumers like pulp and pellet producers.
 As part of their production process, our pulp mills take wood residuals and process them through a digester where cellulose is separated from the wood to be used in pulp production and the remaining residuals, called black liquor, are used for green energy production. As a result of their use of wood residuals and because our mills generate combined heat and power in a process known as cogeneration, they are efficient producers of energy. Our Friesau mill utilizes residual bark and shavings from consumed logs to produce energy. This energy is carbon neutral and produced from a renewable source. Our relatively modern mills generate a substantial amount of energy that is surplus to their operational requirements.
 These factors, along with governmental initiatives in respect of renewable or green energy legislation, have provided business opportunities for us to enhance our generation and sales of green energy to regional utilities.
 We are constantly exploring other initiatives to enhance our generation and sales of surplus green energy and chemical by-products. Other potential opportunities that may result from climate change include:
  
• | the expansion of softwood forests and increased growth rates for such forests;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | more intensive forestry practices and timber salvaging versus harvesting standing timber;

• | greater demand for sustainable energy and cellulosic biomass fuels;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | additional governmental incentives or requirements to enhance biomass energy production; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | additional social or investor focus or demand for biomass or green energy or sustainability initiatives.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Historically, the principal driver behind reducing the effects of climate change and moving to a carbon neutral economy primarily resulted from initiatives from governmental or international bodies, including the United Nations and international treaties amongst various countries. However, over the last few years, there has been a significant push and focus on climate change and carbon reduction by private institutions including, among others, institutional investors, ratings agencies, shareholders, communities, other stakeholders and the public generally. This has resulted in, among other things, a significant amount of capital being provided for "green" or carbon neutral initiatives, on favorable terms, some of which are referred to as "green bonds".
 We cannot currently predict which, if any, of these potential opportunities will be realized by us or their economic effect on our business.
 While not all of the specific consequences to our business from climate change are predictable, one of the most significant adverse consequences is that the focus on renewable energy has created greater demand and competition for wood residuals or fiber from renewable energy producers like the pellet industry in Germany.
 In Europe, the price and supply of wood residuals has been periodically affected by an increasing demand from alternative or renewable energy producers and governmental initiatives for carbon neutral energy. In 2021, increasing energy prices and a stronger economy increased the demand for wood chips resulting from initiatives implemented by European governments to promote the use of wood as a carbon neutral energy. Additionally, the growing interest and focus in British Columbia on renewable green energy has created additional competition for such fiber. Such additional demand for wood residuals may increase the competition and prices for wood residuals used by our mills over time.
 In response to climate change risks, there have been governmental initiatives and legislation on the international, national, state and local levels. Such governmental action or legislation can have an important effect on the demand and prices for fiber. As governments pursue green energy initiatives, they risk creating incentives and demand for wood residuals from renewable energy producers that “cannibalizes” or adversely affects traditional users, such as lumber and pulp and paper producers. We are continually engaged in dialogue with governments to educate and try 
 (24)

to ensure potential initiatives recognize the traditional and continuing role of our mills in the overall usage of forestry resources and the economies of local communities.
 Other potential negative consequences from climate change that can affect our business include:
  
• | a greater susceptibility of northern forests to disease, fire and insect infestation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the disruption of transportation systems and power supply lines due to more severe storms;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the loss of fresh water transportation for logs and pulp due to lower water levels;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | decreases in the quantity and quality of processed water for our mill operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the loss of northern forests in areas in sufficient proximity to our mills to competitively acquire fiber; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | lower harvest levels decreasing the supply of harvestable timber and, as a consequence, wood residuals.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Well-publicized events have been attributed at least in part to climate change, including a beetle infestation that has damaged significant amounts of forest lands and harvestable timber in Western Canada and more recently over the last three years in Germany. Beetle infestation of forest lands has both short-term and long-term consequences for our business. In the short-term, there is often a material increase in harvest levels of infested forests as parties seek to utilize such wood before it deteriorates too much to be useable for its intended purposes. As a result, there can be a material increase in fiber availability and lower fiber prices resulting both from such increased supply and the lower quality of such infested fiber. Over the last three years, our German mills have benefitted from such lower fiber prices. Infestation and increased harvest levels resulting therefrom can create over-harvesting and challenges for maintaining sustainable harvest levels over the long-term and can result in lower harvest levels in future periods.
 Changes in climate conditions have also been attributed at least in part to increasingly frequent and severe wildfires in the interior of Western Canada and portions of the western United States and Europe. We cannot currently predict whether such climate-affected conditions will continue, or the frequency or severity of the same in the future.
 Wood Products Industry
 General
 With approximately 3.7 billion cubic meters, Germany has the largest timber reserves in Europe. The principal species are spruce, pine, beech and oak. Many of the German forest areas have been certified according to PEFC or FSC standards. Modern solid wood products include sawn and planed lumber which are used in different areas.
 Demand for softwood lumber is cyclical and influenced by transportation costs, exchange rates, government tariffs and the competitiveness of substitute products, as well as factors that affect consumer confidence and drive demand for residential construction, such as interest rates, disposable income, unemployment rates, perceived job security and other indicators of general economic conditions. Demand can vary from region to region within a country and seasonal factors that determine optimal building conditions can also affect demand.
 Lumber Products and Markets
 Our Friesau mill, which was built in 1992 and has two high-volume Linck sawlines, has the ability to produce both rough and planed products. The sawmill principally manufactures finished sawn lumber milled from spruce and pine, including European metric and specialty lumber, U.S. dimensional lumber and J-grade lumber, in various sizes and grades.
 The process for manufacturing lumber results in a significant percentage of each sawlog ending up as by-products or residuals such as wood chips, trim blocks, sawdust shavings and bark. By-products are typically used as fuel for our cogeneration power plant or sold to a wide variety of customers. In addition, we utilize a significant portion of the chips from the Friesau mill at our Rosenthal pulp mill.
 (25)

The main markets for our lumber products are in the United States, Europe and the Far East.
 Our Friesau mill fosters a diverse customer base in each of its key markets. Customers include national and regional distributors, large construction firms, secondary manufacturers, retail yards and home centers.
 Competition
 The markets for our lumber products are highly competitive on a global basis and producers compete generally on price, quality and service. Factors influencing our competitive position include, among others, the availability, quality and cost of raw materials, including fiber, energy and labor and the efficiency and productivity of the Friesau mill in relation to its competitors. The Friesau mill competes in international markets subject to currency fluctuations and global business conditions.
 Our Friesau mill competes against many producers, a number of whom own and operate more mills than we do and numerous competitors have greater financial resources or lower production costs than us.
 Human Capital
 We believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success as a global company. All our employees contribute to our success and help us drive strong financial performance. Attracting, developing and retaining global talent with the right skills to drive our business is central to our purpose, mission and long-term growth strategy. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we employ approximately 2,415 people, of which approximately 1,515 of whom work in our German operations and approximately 835 of whom work in our Canadian operations. Our pulp segment employs approximately 1,855 people and our wood products segment employs approximately 455 people. The majority of our employees in both segments are bound by collective agreements. The collective agreement with hourly workers at our Celgar mill expired in 2021 and the mill currently continues to operate under such agreement until a new collective agreement is finalized. While we currently expect the mill to enter into a new agreement based primarily upon a pattern agreement settled with a regional competitor, we cannot assure that a new agreement will be entered into without workplace disruptions or on satisfactory terms. We consider the relationships with our employees, and the unions which represent them, to be good. Strong labor management relations are fundamental to our operations. Accordingly, we recognize and work cooperatively with the unions and works councils to ensure we build and maintain superior working conditions, a supportive work environment, training and growth opportunities and fair compensation packages. 
 We employ a collaborative group of skilled, dedicated, resourceful and innovative individuals who support our core purpose and reflect our values every day. Investment in our people drives our excellence and accordingly, we are committed to attracting, retaining and developing quality personnel. By nature of the industries in which we operate, many of our employees are professionals who require specialized knowledge and skills and include various categories of engineers and many licensed trade persons and equipment operators. Our senior managers and directors have extensive experience in the forest products industry, and we have experienced managers at all of our mills. Our management has a proven track record of implementing new initiatives and capital projects in order to reduce costs throughout our operations as well as identifying and harnessing new revenue opportunities. 
 We aim to support our employees with a well-paying job, rich career opportunities, and a balanced and secure future accompanied by time away from work. All of our employees are provided competitive benefits packages that provide pension, medical, dental, and vision care benefits. Employees are also able to access specialized assistance such as physiotherapy and counselling services. We provide a deep mix of training to help our people grow and be more effective in their current and future roles. 
 We conduct confidential engagement surveys of our workforce that are administered and analyzed by an independent third party. Aggregate survey results are reviewed by executive officers and the board of directors. We create action plans at global, operational and managerial levels. By acting on results both at an aggregate enterprise level and an operational level, we believe we have been able to enhance our culture and improve our overall engagement.
 (26)

Maintaining a robust pipeline of talent is crucial to our ongoing success and is a key aspect of succession planning efforts across the organization. Our leadership and people teams are responsible for attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating an environment where employees feel supported and encouraged in their professional and personal development. Specifically, we promote employee development by reviewing strategic positions regularly and identifying potential internal candidates to fill those roles, evaluating job skill sets to identify competency gaps and creating developmental plans to facilitate employee professional growth. We invest in our employees through training and development programs, on the job experiences and coaching. We provide technical and leadership programs across the organization that enable colleagues to grow skills and capabilities to become more successful. We also have dedicated talent programs that support and accelerate leadership development and strengthen our succession plans. Additionally, we understand the importance of maintaining competitive compensation, benefits and appropriate training that provides growth, developmental opportunities and multiple career paths for our employees.
 Health and Safety
 Safety is a core value of our company. The industries in which we operate have their own particular set of risks including hazards from our complex industrial manufacturing facilities such as manufacturing processes, heavy and complex equipment, operating boilers, energy production, and the use and recovery of chemicals. Accordingly, there is no initiative that attracts a higher degree of focus for our management team than our “Road to Zero” program, which is a company-wide initiative designed to create safe and productive work environments with a goal of zero workplace incidents. 
 We have developed tools to analyze potential and incurred incidents and we have resources to develop prevention initiatives. In particular, we focus on modelling responses to eliminate the risk, where possible, by using the “hierarchy of controls” adopted by many of the world’s leading health and safety organizations. Our priority is the elimination of hazards, followed by safe administrative practices and appropriate personal protective equipment. We identify, monitor, educate, and take a data-driven approach to drive workplace safety improvements. Many of our programs revolve around education, hazard identification, and risk mitigation strategies. These proactive initiatives bring safety to the forefront of our work practices. Our teams of safety professionals are dedicated to finding and utilizing the right tools to prevent all workplace injuries. Our Chief Executive Officer is the Chair of our Senior Safety Leadership Committee, referred to as the “SSLC”, which designs and implements broad policies, strategies, expenditures, and training for our employees. The SSLC has engaged a globally recognized safety consultant specializing in the design and implementation of health and safety management systems. Such advisors have been supporting the initiatives established by the SSLC and providing leadership training, policy implementation, and practical tools to support our employees. 
 We closely monitor the health and safety issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, we encouraged and supported remote-access initiatives so that key staff can work from home or from non-office locations; restricted business travel, based on guidance from the World Health Organization; provided alternative arrangements for site and staff meetings; provided safe working environments that include disinfection of work stations, increased cleaning by janitorial staff, separated shifts, limited staff gatherings in lunchrooms; and instituted social distancing and self-assessment opportunities, which were overseen by trained staff. Employees experiencing cold- or flu-like symptoms were prohibited from coming into the operations and were advised to seek medical attention in line with provincial and regional COVID-19 guidelines. From an operational standpoint, we aligned the work processes at our operating locations within the guidelines of relevant authorities and remained fully operational. A dedicated leadership team met daily to respond to evolving developments and to adjust our operations accordingly while ensuring the safety and health of our employees, contractors, customers, and partners. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 We believe that a culture of diversity and inclusion is critical in making the best decisions for our people and achieving sustainable business success. While gender is only one aspect under diversity, a number of our top management positions were and continue to be held by women. We continue to effect changes to our recruiting and training processes to make our workplaces even more reflective of the diversity that exists in our communities. We believe that making our workplace more equal and inclusive will make us a stronger, more resilient and a more sustainable business over the long-term.
 (27)

We have adopted an enterprise wide diversity management program. Its goal is to respond to the particular conditions at each of our operations to develop diversity within our teams. One of the first objectives of the program has been to enhance equal opportunities for women in our business. This is a key goal, not just to improve diversity but also to address demographic changes and potential shortages of skilled workers in the future by inspiring more women to take up technical positions in our industry.
 Currently, women comprise 30% of our board of directors, about 23% of our top 100 management positions and 18% of our total workforce. Our goal is to improve our recruitment of women so that they comprise 30% of our new hires by 2030.
 In Canada, our operations work closely and partner with regional First Nations groups to foster mutually-beneficial economic activities and beneficial relationships. We are party to a logging joint venture with one First Nations group and are working to expand the scope and size of the business and to include other regional groups. We are also pursuing additional joint business or venture opportunities with First Nations groups, including a joint trucking and transportation business. Additionally, we have programs to provide training and job skills to regional First Nations groups.
 In Germany, we have an extensive apprenticeship program and outreach events for prospective employees. We believe that these programs and events, among other things, help us to reach out and attract new employees, including more women employees who perhaps in the past had not considered technical or operating employment opportunities at our mills or the forest products industry generally.
 We have partnered with a global management consulting company that works to create “Change that Matters”. Their long-standing commitment to advancing gender parity, diversity, and inclusion in business aligns with our values and goals. We are working together to create a custom strategy to assist us in becoming the employer of choice, both locally and globally, for future employees.
 We do not employ nor do we contract with any parties that employ people who are subjected to unsafe conditions. The vast majority of our employees are part of a union or are represented by a works council with whom we have worked to design conditions that are safe from harassment and discrimination. In addition, as a supportive workplace, we do our best to accommodate the distinct circumstances of our employees that may require modified workplaces. We have also adopted a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies to support a corporate culture which, among other things, promotes a work environment that prohibits intimidation and harassment and encourages and promotes diversity and inclusion.
 Community Involvement
 We make donations to community groups and charitable organizations in the communities in which we operate and live. We believe this commitment and engagement with local communities helps us to attract and retain employees and enhances our social licence in such communities.
Commitment to Sustainability
 We manage and operate our business, including the natural resources under our care or direction, with a long-term view and focus on sustainability. We believe by doing so we will be able to deliver value to our customers, employees, shareholders, communities and other stakeholders. We strive to maintain the highest environmental, social and governance standards. We believe that by caring for the health and safety of our workers, maintaining the environmental quality of our operations and being part of and actively engaged in the communities in which we operate we enhance the value for all of our various stakeholders and our social licence to operate. We work to build all of these values and goals into our corporate culture or what we refer to as the “Mercer Way”. We believe that focusing on sustainability as a key driver in all of our operations and business will enhance our decision-making, our business and our relationships with our various stakeholders and communities in which we operate. We believe all of the foregoing elements are inter-connected and are vital to our long-term future, success and sustainability.
 We focus significant attention on minimizing our environmental impact with the goal of reducing the environmental footprint of our existing operations to make them sustainable over the long-term, to ensure we have a social licence to operate and to offset or reduce the impact of our operations. We endeavor to adapt to emerging trends, support 
 (28)

new technologies and foster environmental stewardship in the areas in which we operate. Our endeavors are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and other key environmental standards in the areas of low carbon transition, water stewardship, waste, forestry, air emissions, recycling, sourcing and biodiversity. 
 As part of our commitment and focus on sustainability, we have, among other things:
  
• | increased our focus on sustainability including with improved management, goal setting and recording capabilities that will be communicated with stakeholders to ensure proper acknowledgment of our sustainability accomplishments and initiatives;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | conducted a climate risk change scenario and opportunities assessment as part of our adoption of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure recommendations. In doing so, we partnered with a global non-profit organization focused on sustainability to develop a series of climate change scenarios for 2030. These models were developed with extensive input from the climate community, and augmented with industry trends and climate projections. The scenarios were then analyzed and used to identify and assess the potential impacts of climate change-related risks and opportunities on the Company. As a result of this process, we identified three areas of our strategy that may incur risks and opportunities across the scenarios: (i) shifting market demand; (ii) wood and fiber supply; and (iii) stakeholder perceptions. Further information on the key parameters and assumptions used to develop the various models is available on our website; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhanced our environmental tracking, measuring and reporting system for both water and air parameters at all of our facilities; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | spent considerable time with our stakeholders including governments and First Nations to expand our relationships in all areas of our business.

Description of Certain Indebtedness
 The following summarizes certain material provisions of our senior notes and revolving working capital facilities. The summaries are not complete and are qualified by reference to the applicable documents and the applicable amendments to such documents on file with the SEC, and incorporated by reference herein.
Senior Notes
 In January 2021, we issued $875.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due February 1, 2029, referred to as the “2029 Senior Notes” to refinance all $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.500% Senior Notes due 2024, referred to as the “2024 Senior Notes”, pursuant to a tender offer and a subsequent redemption and to redeem all $550.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.375% senior notes due 2025, referred to as the “2025 Senior Notes”. After giving effect to the foregoing transactions, we now have outstanding the following issues of senior notes, collectively referred to as the “Senior Notes”:

• | $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500% senior notes due 2026, referred to as the “2026 Senior Notes”; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | $875.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2029 Senior Notes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 (29)


The 2026 Senior Notes mature on January 15, 2026 and interest on the 2026 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each January 15 and July 15. Commencing July 15, 2018, interest is payable to holders of record of the 2026 Senior Notes on the immediately preceding January 1 and July 1 and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Commencing January 15, 2021, the 2026 Senior Notes became redeemable at our option at a price equal to 102.750% of the principal amount redeemed and declining ratably on January 15 of each year thereafter to 100.000% on or after January 15, 2023.
 The 2029 Senior Notes mature on February 1, 2029 and interest on the 2029 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each February 1 and August 1. Commencing August 1, 2021, interest is payable to holders of record of the 2029 Senior Notes on the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15 and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Commencing February 1, 2024, the 2029 Senior Notes will become redeemable at our option at a price equal to 102.563% of the principal amount redeemed and declining ratably on February 1 of each year thereafter to 100.000% on or after February 1, 2026.
 The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain covenants limiting, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions to our shareholders; purchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; make investments; create liens; incur restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us; sell assets; consolidate or merge with or into other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and engage in transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2021, all of our subsidiaries were restricted subsidiaries.
 The Senior Notes are unsecured and are not guaranteed by any of our operating subsidiaries, all of which are located outside the United States. Our obligations under the Senior Notes rank: effectively junior in right of payment to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness, and all indebtedness and liabilities of our subsidiaries; equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness; and senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness.
 Pan-German Revolving Credit Facility
 In December 2018, certain of our German subsidiaries entered into a €200.0 million joint revolving credit facility, referred to as the “German Facility”, with a group of bank lenders. The principal terms of the facility include:

• | The total availability under the German Facility is €200.0 million.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The German Facility matures in December 2023.
--+----------------------------------------------


• | The German Facility is unsecured and is jointly and severally guaranteed by each of our German subsidiaries.

• | The German Facility contains financial maintenance covenants which are tested on a quarterly basis, commencing March 31, 2019, which require: (i) our German subsidiaries that are party thereto to maintain a leverage ratio of “net debt” (excluding shareholder loans) to EBITDA of not greater than 3.50:1.00; and (ii) defined capital of not less than €400.0 million.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The German Facility contains other customary restrictive covenants which, among other things, govern the ability of our German subsidiaries to incur liens, sell assets, incur indebtedness, make acquisitions with proceeds from the German Facility, enter into joint ventures or repurchase or redeem shares. The German Facility also contains customary events of default.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The German Facility is available to all of the borrowers, subject to maximum borrowing sub-limits for certain of the borrowers.

As of December 31, 2021, approximately €10.5 million ($11.9 million) of the German Facility was supporting bank guarantees leaving approximately €189.5 million ($214.6 million) available.
 Canadian Revolving Credit Facility
 In January 2022, our Celgar and Peace River mills and certain other subsidiaries entered into a new C$160.0 million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of three North American banks, referred to as the “Canadian Revolving Facility”. This facility replaced and discharged a prior C$60.0 million revolving credit facility for our Celgar mill and a C$60.0 million revolving credit facility for our Peace River mill. The principal terms of the Canadian Revolving Facility include:
