Item 1.    Business.
Overview
Liquidity Services, Inc. (Liquidity Services, the Company) is a leading global commerce company providing trusted marketplace platforms that power the circular economy. We create a better future for organizations, individuals, and the planet by capturing and unleashing the intrinsic value of surplus. We connect millions of buyers and thousands of sellers through our leading auction marketplaces, search engines, asset management software, and related services. Our comprehensive solutions enable the transparent, efficient, sustainable recovery of value from excess items owned by business and government sellers.
Our business strives to deliver value to shareholders by unleashing the intrinsic value of surplus through our marketplace platforms. These platforms ignite and enable a self-reinforcing cycle of value creation where buyers and sellers attract one another in greater numbers. The result of this cycle is a continuous flow of goods that becomes increasingly valuable as more participants join the platforms, thereby creating positive network effects that benefit sellers, buyers, and shareholders. During the past three fiscal years, we have conducted over 2.2 million online transactions generating $2.7 billion in gross merchandise volume or GMV. GMV is the total sales value of all merchandise sold by us or our sellers through our marketplaces or by us through other channels during a given period of time.
During the year ended September 30, 2022, the number of registered buyers grew from 4.0 million to 4.9 million, or 22%. We generated GMV of $1,145 million and revenue of $280.1 million through multiple sources, including transaction fees from sellers and buyers, proceeds from the sale of products we purchased from sellers, and value-added service charges during the year ended September 30, 2022. Our GMV has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 12.5% since 2006. 
Results from our operations are organized into four reportable segments: GovDeals, Retail Supply Chain Group (RSCG), Capital Assets Group (CAG) and Machinio. See Note 16 - Segment Information for more information regarding our segments.
Liquidity Services was incorporated in Delaware in November 1999 as Liquidation.com, Inc. and commenced operations in early 2000.
On November 1, 2021, we acquired Bid4Assets, Inc. (Bid4Assets), a Maryland corporation based in Silver Spring, MD. Bid4Assets is a leading online marketplace focused on conducting real property auctions for the government, including tax foreclosure sales and sheriff's sales. See Note 3 - Bid4Assets Acquisition for more information regarding this transaction.
Industry Overview
While a well-established forward supply chain exists for the procurement of assets, many manufacturers, retailers, corporations and government agencies have recognized the growing need for strategic reverse supply chain solutions. For example, according to Allied Market Research (Reverse Logistics Market by Return Type: Global Opportunity and Industry Forecast 2021-2028 (July 2021)), the global reverse logistics market is expected to reach $958 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 5.6% from 2021 to 2028. 
The retail industry, as per an Appriss Retail and National Retail Federation Q4 2021 returns survey (Customer Returns in the Retail Industry 2021), estimates that approximately $761 billion of merchandise is returned on an annual basis, representing almost 17% of total sales. Liquidity Services estimates that at least $100 billion of these returns are moved through secondary markets, with the remaining volume returning to retailer shelves or being sold through discount retailers. 
Estimates based on Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), U.S. Census, and World Bank reports, indicate that the global used equipment market is valued at approximately $350 billion.
Assets handled by reverse supply chain solutions generally consist of retail customer returns, overstock products and end-of-life goods or capital assets from both corporate and government sectors. The supply of surplus and idle assets in the reverse supply chain results from a number of factors, including:
•Increasing focus by corporate and government agencies to seek green solutions for surplus assets. Many organizations appreciate the growing need to be environmentally friendly by improving their management of end-of-life or surplus goods, including the need to repurpose or efficiently redistribute surplus and capital assets to minimize waste and maximize value for themselves and the communities they serve.
•Supply chain inefficiencies. Forecasting inaccuracies, manufacturer overruns, canceled orders, evolving market preferences, discontinued product lines, merchandise packaging changes and seasonal fluctuations result in the growth of surplus assets. Organizations that manufacture, distribute, sell or use finished goods regularly dispose of excess inventory or returned merchandise.
•Growth of e-commerce. According to Digital Commerce 360 (US Ecommerce Grows 10.8% in Q3 2022), over 20% of all retail purchases come from online orders. Furthermore, online purchases have a higher return rate at almost 21%, greater than that of 17% for total retail sales overall (CNBC: A more than $761 billion dilemma: Retailers’ returns jump as online sales grow (January 2022)). As e-commerce growth accelerates, the flow of assets in the retail reverse supply chain is likely to grow. 
•Product innovation. Continuous innovation in technology products, such as computer and office equipment, consumer electronics, and personal communication and entertainment devices, results in a continuous flow of surplus assets. Innovation also results in manufacturing equipment and tooling being upgraded and replaced which generates a separate flow of surplus capital assets.
•Return policies of large national and online retailers. The flexible return practices of many large national retailers and online shopping sites result in a continuous supply of returned merchandise, a significant portion of which must be liquidated.
•Compliance with government regulations. An increasingly stringent regulatory environment necessitates verifiable recycling and remarketing of surplus assets that would otherwise be disposed of as waste.
•Changing budgetary trends in corporate and governmental entities. As corporate and governmental entities are increasingly pressured to enhance efficiencies while also using fewer resources, they are looking to the liquidation of surplus and salvage capital assets as a source of funds.
The management and remarketing of surplus assets traditionally has been an inefficient process. While many organizations spend considerable resources developing systems and channels supporting the flow of finished goods to their core customers as well as developing procurement processes for acquiring equipment and assets to support their operations, we believe that many have not historically invested resources in the reverse supply chain in the same way as the forward supply chain. Factors contributing to these inefficiencies in the reverse supply chain include the lack of:
•a centralized and global marketplace to sell bulk products as well as machinery and equipment in the reverse supply chain;
•awareness of effective methods and mechanisms for the disposal of surplus assets;
•experience in managing the reverse supply chain to seek optimal net returns and improve gross margins; and
•real time market data on surplus assets.
Traditional methods of surplus and salvage asset disposition include ad-hoc sales, negotiated direct sales, utilization of individual brokers or sales agents and live on-site auctions. We believe these solutions are generally highly fragmented, geographically dispersed and poorly integrated with supply chain operations. The manual, negotiated and geographically dispersed nature of traditional surplus resale methods results in a lack of pricing transparency for offered goods, multiple brokers/parties ultimately involved in the final disposition and a lower number of potential buyers and bids, which we believe typically leads to lower recovery for sellers.
Professional buyers seek surplus and salvage assets to sustain their operations and meet demands of end-customers. They include online and offline retailers, convenience and discount stores, value-added resellers such as refurbishers and scrap recyclers, import and export firms, and small businesses. Traditionally, these buyers have had limited access to a reliable flow of surplus goods and assets, relying instead on their own network of industry contacts and fixed-site auctioneers to locate, evaluate and purchase specific items of interest. Traditional methods are inefficient for buyers due to the lack of:
•global access to an available continuous supply of desired goods and assets;
•efficient and inexpensive sourcing processes;
•a professionally managed central marketplace with transparent, high quality services;
•detailed information and product description for the offered goods; and
•pricing transparency or ability to compare asset prices.
We believe professional buyers of surplus and salvage assets will increasingly use these business to business (B2B) platforms to identify and source goods available for immediate online purchase.
Our Solutions
Our solutions include e-commerce marketplaces, self-directed auction listing tools, and value-added services. Our marketplaces and services provide sellers a comprehensive solution to quickly bring surplus assets to market and enhance the financial value realized from the sale of their surplus assets while providing buyers with confidence in the reliable flow of goods they purchase. We provide our sellers access to a network of liquid marketplaces with over 4.9 million buyers and a suite of services including consultative surplus asset management, valuation, sales solutions, logistics capabilities, and self-directed service tools to efficiently manage our sellers' reverse supply chain and maximize total supply chain value. We also seek the optimal methods to maximize our sellers' net recovery using channel strategies and dedicated programs to deliver transparent, sustained value.
Through our relationships with our sellers, we provide our buyers with convenient access to a substantial and continuous flow of surplus and salvage assets. Buyers can find products in over 600 categories in lot sizes ranging from full truckloads to pallets, packages and individual items. Our solution combines leading e-commerce marketplaces with integrated sales, marketing, merchandising, fulfillment, payment collection, customer support, dispute mediation and logistics services. We provide our buyers with a convenient method for sourcing surplus consumer goods and electronics, commercial capital assets, industrial equipment, energy equipment, biopharma assets and real estate. We continually look for new categories in which we can expand our presence. For any given asset, our buyers have access to a detailed product description, product manifest, digital images, relevant transaction history regarding the seller, and, where appropriate, the shipping weights, product dimensions and estimated shipping costs to the buyer's location. This enables our solutions to become an important source for surplus and salvage assets for many of our professional buyers and end-users.
We believe our marketplaces benefit over time from greater scale and adoption by our constituents creating a continuous flow of goods benefiting our buyers and sellers. As of September 30, 2022, we had 4.9 million registered buyers in our marketplaces. We had access to millions of additional end-users through a range of external consumer marketplaces. Aggregating this level of buyer demand and market data enables us to generate a continuous flow of goods from corporate and government sellers, which in turn attracts an increasing number of buyers. During the year ended September 30, 2022, we had approximately 3.1 million auction participants in our online auctions. During fiscal 2022, we grew our registered buyer base by 21.6% or 871,000. Of the increase, approximately 16% is attributable to the Bid4Assets register buyer base acquired during the three months ended December 31, 2021. As buyers continue to discover and use our e-commerce marketplaces as an effective method to source assets, we believe our solutions become an increasingly attractive sales channel for corporate and government agency sellers. We believe this self-reinforcing cycle results in greater transaction volume and enhances the value of our marketplaces.
Competitive Factors
We have created liquid marketplaces for virtually any type, quantity or condition of surplus or salvage assets. The strengths of our business model include:
Aggregation of supply and demand for surplus and salvage assets
The strength of our business model rests on our ability to aggregate sellers and buyers through our marketplaces. Sellers benefit from a liquid, transparent market and the active participation of our large base of professional buyers, which enhances their returns in comparison to less efficient models. Buyers benefit from our relationships with high-volume, corporate and government sellers, which provides them with continuous access to a comprehensive selection of surplus and salvage assets. Our solution eliminates the need for sellers and buyers to rely on the highly fragmented and geographically dispersed group of traditional liquidators. Instead, sellers and buyers access our global e-commerce marketplaces for their entire surplus and salvage asset needs.
Integrated and comprehensive solution
Our marketplaces provide sellers and buyers with a comprehensive solution for the online sale and purchase of surplus and salvage assets. We offer marketplaces with full-service and self-directed solutions. Our self-directed solutions provide transaction settlement and marketing support while allowing sellers to undertake the work of photographing, cataloging, and building their auctions. 
Our value-added services simplify the sales and supply chain processes for our sellers and improve the utility of our marketplaces for our buyers. For corporate and certain government sellers, we provide sales, marketing, logistics and seller support services that are fully integrated with our marketplaces, creating operational and system efficiencies. For many of these sellers, asset disposition is not a core business function to which they desire to dedicate internal resources. With our solution, we manage each step of the transaction and reverse supply chain for our sellers, reducing complexity while providing the ability to optimize the seller's net financial return in the sale of surplus goods and assets. Sellers simply make goods available at their facilities or deliver them to our distribution centers and we deliver the sale proceeds, less our portion of such proceeds and/or our commissions or fees, after the sale is completed. In response to feedback from our sellers, we have learned that our sellers prefer bespoke returns process management or return to vendor solutions tailored to their own systems, and accordingly, we have shifted focus from developing SaaS solutions to refining our own internal returns management processes that we use to serve our sellers. 
We have also expanded our capabilities to process individual items, pallets, less-than-truckload (LTL) and full-truckload (FTL) auctions. This provides our retail sellers with flexible solutions that can scale to solve their unique liquidity challenges while leveraging our various retail channels to maximize their recovery value. 
Our buyer services include intelligent alerts, search tools, dynamic pricing, shipping and delivery where available, secure payment, live buyer support and dispute resolution to enable effective methods to source assets for their businesses.
Flexible and aligned transaction model
We offer two primary transaction models to our sellers: the purchase transaction model and the consignment transaction model. Under the purchase transaction model, we purchase inventory from a seller that we resell in our marketplaces. Sometimes our inventory purchase price is variable, as we may share the gross or net proceeds of such resales with the seller. Sellers that elect the purchase transaction model are considered vendors. Under the consignment transaction model, we do not purchase inventory from a seller; instead, we enable a seller to sell its goods in our marketplaces and we earn commission revenue based on the proceeds received from the sale. Sellers that elect the consignment transaction model are considered consignors.
Faster transaction cycle times for our sellers and buyers
We believe our marketplace solutions allow our sellers to complete the entire sales process more rapidly than through other liquidation methods by reducing the complexities in the reverse supply chain and utilizing our multi-channel strategies to optimize recovery and velocity. As a result, our sellers can reduce surplus or less valuable inventory quickly, generate additional working capital and reduce the cost of carrying unwanted assets. We provide a complete solution to enable professional buyers of any size throughout the world to purchase assets efficiently. For these buyers, we provide a broad range of services to give them the information necessary to make an informed bid and ensure they quickly and efficiently receive the goods purchased.
Solutions that promote sustainability for improved corporate/government stewardship
Our e-commerce marketplace solutions power the circular economy and provide benefits to businesses, communities, and the environment. We achieve this through our safe and effective resale and redeployment of surplus assets; our reduction of waste; and by creating markets for items that might otherwise have been landfilled. Some of the world's largest forward-thinking corporations and government agencies have enhanced their stewardship of communities and the environment by utilizing our services and selling their surplus assets through our marketplaces.
Technology, data & analytics enhance our services and solutions for buyers and sellers
We continue to make strategic investments in our technology capabilities. Aligning the capabilities of our auction platforms with the Company’s unique, vertical-specific knowledge has enabled us to develop the AllSurplus marketplace. This platform provides an aggregated view of all assets available globally in our government and commercial sectors, and retail assets for select local markets. By coupling an intuitive, mobile-optimized design with site search and recommendations driven by machine learning, the platform is optimized to assist buyers in quickly finding the assets that meet their needs. Our sellers benefit from the unique nature of our unified platform by having their assets available, simultaneously, on multiple marketplaces while guaranteeing the integrity of the cross-site auction bidding. Placing the assets on multiple sites enables the marketing organization to directly target unique buyer segments that resonate with an asset’s unique audience niche.
Our data infrastructure and analytics continue to provide near real-time operational insights. By coupling our click-stream data and bid activity with our campaign activity, the marketing organization leverages a feedback loop that increases campaign effectiveness and optimizes spend.
Our Strategy
The focus of our growth strategy is to build the world’s leading marketplace for surplus assets to benefit buyers, sellers, and the planet. Our strategic plan rests on four pillars, that we refer to by the acronym RISE, which pillars are as follows: 
Recovery Maximization
Based on feedback from our sellers, we believe recovery maximization is the single most important driver to attracting sellers to our marketplaces. We believe that the key to achieving higher net recovery is, in turn, driven by attracting buyers to our marketplace which we believe that we do through technology and innovation that improves the buyer experience across our network of marketplaces. An improved buyer experience drives growth in our buyer base which will, in turn, improve recovery rates for our sellers. 
Increase Volume
We intend to grow the volume of transacted surplus on our marketplaces with flexible service offerings and pricing models to meet the needs of existing and new sellers. We have expanded our self-directed service model to allow commercial sellers that do not require a full-service solution to leverage the power of our marketing and online marketplaces to drive buyer demand for their assets. This approach allows us to more completely penetrate the total addressable market by better meeting the needs of small and mid-sized organizations, equipment dealers, and organizations with lower volume needs. We also anticipate increasing volume by placing a greater focus on certain categories, including real estate, construction, and heavy equipment. We intend to grow our volume within the retail supply chain by leveraging the self-directed service model, continuing to expand our distribution network, and the launching of AllSurplus Deals in fiscal year 2020 as a new marketplace offering consumers deals for curbside pickup. We will continue to provide flexible pricing models that allow our sellers to use either a consignment or a Purchase-based model. 
Service Expansion
We intend to grow our services with recurring revenue characteristics that leverage our technology platform, domain expertise, data, and marketplace channels. By leveraging our extensive knowledge and technology, we intend to grow our revenue by attracting more sellers and more volume through expanding our services to better support sellers and buyers and expanding and improving our asset management and redeployment tools for commercial and municipal government sellers on our new aggregated marketplace. Lastly, we are leveraging our Machinio segment to expand our capabilities with respect to technology-enabled advertising. This is a natural adjunct to our self-service and full-service solutions available in our marketplaces.
Expense Leverage
We intend to improve operating expense leverage by controlling costs and through technology innovation that increases productivity. We have simplified and streamlined our operations and consolidated business processes and systems, which has improved scalability. We have a unified marketing organization to improve our seller and buyer marketing productivity by increasing the number of sellers using our platform and by driving increased volumes of highly targeted buyers to our marketplaces. 
Our Marketplaces
Our network of marketplace brands serves buyers and sellers in numerous industries across hundreds of product categories. 
Our e-commerce marketplaces are efficient and convenient methods for the sale of surplus and salvage consumer goods and capital assets in over 600 product categories including consumer electronics, general merchandise, apparel, scientific equipment, aerospace parts and equipment, technology hardware, real estate, energy equipment, industrial capital assets, heavy equipment, fleet and transportation equipment and specialty equipment. They are designed to address the particular requirements and needs of buyers and sellers. We operate and enable several marketplaces, including the following:
•Our GovDeals marketplace provides self-directed service solutions in which sellers list their own assets, and enables local and state government entities including city, county and state agencies, located in the United States and Canada to sell surplus and salvage assets. GovDeals also offers a suite of self-directed solutions that include transaction settlement and buyer marketing.
•Our AllSurplus marketplace, launched in fiscal year 2020, leverages our 20 years of experience in the online surplus industry to create a centralized marketplace that connects our entire global buyer base with assets from across our network of marketplaces in a single destination. The AllSurplus platform will continually evolve as we enhance our marketplace technology and add new seller and buyer services.
•Our Liquidation.com marketplace enables corporations located in the United States and Canada to sell surplus and salvage consumer goods and retail capital assets. This leading B2B marketplace and our related value-added services are designed to meet the needs of our sellers by selling their surplus assets to domestic and international buyers.
We also provide a global search, advertising, and inventory management platform that connects dealers and sellers of used machinery and equipment in the construction, machine tool, transportation, printing, and agriculture sectors with interested buyers through our Machinio segment. 
Besides these leading business-to-business marketplaces, we recognize the need to reach end users for some assets our sellers have entrusted to us. We have developed the capability to sell products on our sellers' behalf directly to end-users and/or consumers using a range of existing marketplaces. During fiscal year 2020, AllSurplus Deals was born as an expansion of the core platform enabling a hyper-localized direct to consumer experience. AllSurplus Deals provides a convenient, local pickup solution connecting our retail supply directly to consumers in our target markets. 
In addition to our e-commerce marketplaces, we have dedicated sales teams supporting the needs of our established global buyer base that seeks items in larger quantities than are offered through our standard auction platforms. These range from a single truckload to ongoing flows of goods for export anywhere in the world, where we market, handle, and support the full transaction on behalf of our buyers. We expect to continue to meet the needs of our sellers and to access a growing range of products for all buyers by enhancing our multi-channel strategy to ensure we create value for assets at the end of their initial product life cycle.
Our Value-Added Services for Buyers and Sellers
In addition to our self-directed tools for our sellers, we have integrated value-added services to simplify the reverse supply chain processes for both our sellers and buyers. We believe these services generate operational efficiencies within this element of the supply chain enabling the greatest value for sellers and buyers with the highest level of confidence and transparency in the services we provide. Additionally, we believe these services improve compliance with the policies, regulations and sale restrictions of our corporate and government sellers while supporting, or greatly enhancing, many corporate or government environmental initiatives.
Seller services. We offer value-added services to sellers in three areas: (1) merchandising and channel optimization; (2) logistics; and (3) settlement and seller support, including compliance services.
•Merchandising and Channel Optimization. Our efforts encompass the services necessary to prepare retail merchandise for a successful auction and include the following:
◦Channel optimization—we determine the marketplace and channel sales strategy that we believe will create the most value for the individual asset using our real-time transaction systems and proprietary data to support ongoing optimization.
◦Marketing and promotion—we use a variety of both online and traditional marketing methods to promote our sellers' merchandise and generate interest in each asset.
◦Asset lotting and merchandising—we leverage our industry experience to organize the merchandise we receive into size and product combinations that meet buyer preferences within each marketplace and channel.
◦Product information enhancement—we provide digital images of the merchandise to be sold and combine the images with relevant information. To increase the realized sales value, we also research, collect and use supplemental product information to enhance product descriptions.
•Logistics. We provide logistics services designed to support the receipt, handling, transportation and tracking of merchandise offered through our marketplaces, including the following:
◦Distribution centers—we provide sellers with the flexibility of either having us manage the sales process at their location or delivering merchandise to one of our distribution centers.
◦Inventory management—sellers benefit from our management and inventory tracking system designed so merchandise is received, processed and delivered promptly.
◦Cataloguing merchandise—we catalogue all merchandise, which enables us to provide useful product information to buyers and sellers. In certain circumstances, we inspect the merchandise and provide condition descriptions to improve quality and the financial recovery to the seller.
◦Testing, data wiping, de-labeling and refurbishment—we test products, wipe electronic data, refurbish and remove labels and product markings from merchandise prior to sale in order to add value to the asset and protect sellers' brand equity and distribution relationships.
◦Return to vendor or product disposition to non-sales channels—we manage the end-to-end processes for our sellers ensuring that returned merchandise is disposed of in compliance with a variety of disposition requirements. We provide end-to-end management of returning products to vendors, charities, or channels outside of our leading marketplace solutions.
◦Outbound fulfillment—we can arrange for domestic or international shipping for all merchandise, whether it is a small item or container load for export located in one of our distribution centers or at a seller's facility.
•Settlement and seller support. Settlement and seller support services are designed for successful and reliable completion of transactions and include:
◦Buyer qualification—we qualify buyers to ensure their compliance with government or seller mandated terms of sale, as well as to confirm their ability to complete a transaction.
◦Collection and settlement—we collect payments on behalf of sellers prior to delivery of any merchandise and disburse the proceeds to the seller after the satisfaction of all conditions of a sale.
◦Transaction tracking and reporting—we enable sellers and buyers to track and monitor the status of their transactions throughout the sales process. We support the successful completion of each transaction on behalf of the buyer and seller. We provide a range of comprehensive reporting services to sellers upon the completion of a transaction. Our invoicing and reporting tools can be integrated with the seller's information system, providing a more efficient flow of data. 
◦Seller support and dispute resolution—we provide full support throughout the transaction process and dispute resolution for our buyers and sellers if needed. 
Buyer services.  Many of the services we provide to sellers also benefit buyers by providing them with the information to make a more informed bid and by delivering the goods they purchased. Our buyer-focused services include:
•Intelligent alerts and recommendations—we notify buyers of upcoming auctions based on their registered preferences and prior transaction history. Registered preferences can be as broad as a product category or as specific as a part number or key word. We use this information to ensure informed recommendations whenever we identify a product that fits a buyer's preference. We will alert our buyers based on their preferences when auctions are initially launched or nearing conclusion and based on various other parameters to enable our buyers to see relevant products.
•Search and navigation tools—buyers can search our marketplaces for products based on a variety of criteria and personalized settings, including product category, keyword, lot size, product condition, product geographic location and auction ending date.
•Dynamic pricing tools, product information, and shipping quotes—we offer multiple dynamic pricing tools including outbid notification, automated bid agent and automatic auction extension. In addition, we provide buyers the information they need to make informed decisions, including product data, seller performance, and online shipping quotes to help understand their landed cost.
•Broad and flexible range of shipping/pick-up options—we can provide packaging and shipping services for many transactions, whether it is a small item or container loads for export, including buyer pick-up at our premises, for the majority of transactions, or support buyer arranged transportation. 
•Secure settlement and buyer support—besides qualifying sellers, providing several electronic payment options and serving as a trusted market intermediary, we verify transaction completion, which enhances buyer confidence. In addition, we provide full reliable buyer support throughout the transaction process.
Sales and Marketing
We use sales and marketing activities to acquire and manage our seller and buyer accounts. Our sales activities are focused on acquiring new sellers and expanding existing sellers' use of our solutions. Our marketing activities are focused on acquiring and activating new buyers and increasing existing buyers' participation. Our marketing team also manages our marketplace brands and drives seller lead generation efforts that support the sales team.
Sales
Our sales personnel develop seller relationships, contract to provide our services and manage the business accounts on an on-going basis. Our sales team focuses on building long-term relationships with sellers that we believe will generate recurring transactions. They also leverage our years of experience and market data of completed transactions to identify which of our various services would be beneficial to each new or existing seller. Our sales team works with several auction partners globally for both purchase and consignment transaction model projects. In addition, we have a lead generation team which tracks relevant media around the world. The lead generation team uses several sources to research information relevant to our marketplaces, which sources include news aggregators, trade journals, industry specific web sites and business reports on a global basis.
We organize our sellers into two distinct groups: full-service sellers, and self-directed sellers. We base our approach on our experience in understanding and serving the unique needs of each type of seller:
•Full-service sellers.  These sellers require a customized approach, using a combination of our industry-focused sales team and our value-added services to create a comprehensive solution tailored to their needs.
•Self-directed sellers.  These sellers are offered a turn-key solution enabling them to self-direct the sale of their assets on our marketplaces by accessing tools and resources to optimize their net recovery.
Our sales personnel receive salary and performance-based commissions.
Marketing
We use a variety of online and traditional marketing strategies to attract and activate buyers to maximize the number of bidders participating in our e-commerce marketplaces as well as to support our sales team:
•Buyer acquisition.  We utilize marketing automation and digital marketing, including paid search advertising, search engine optimization, affiliate programs and cross promotion to acquire new buyers. We supplement this online marketing with special event print media, classified advertisements and selected direct mail campaigns. Public relations campaigns, participation in trade shows and speaking engagements also complement our overall buyer acquisition efforts. 
•Buyer participation.  We use many tools to increase buyer participation, including: targeted opt-in e-mail newsletters that provide content based on the buyer's stated categories of interest and past bidding or transaction activity; special e-mail alerts highlighting specific products of interest; personalized recommendation engines; and convenient search tools that enable a buyer or prospective buyer to find desired items on our e-commerce marketplaces. 
•Market research.  In order to better target buyers by industry segment, geographic location or other criteria, our marketing department continually gathers data and information from each of the buyer segments we serve. In addition, the marketing department conducts regular surveys to better understand buyers' behavior and needs. We have adopted a privacy policy and have implemented security measures to protect this information. 
•Sales Support.  Our marketing department employs a robust demand generation program, creates documentation and research to support our sales team in presenting our company to potential sellers, including sales brochures and white papers, and participates in selected trade shows. 
All marketing activities are evaluated based on the level of auction participation in our marketplaces, the cost to acquire new participants, and the cost effectiveness of each action.
Technology and IT Infrastructure
As digital transformation accelerates globally, sellers are searching for partner solutions that enable them to move faster and generate maximum recovery with minimal investment. Buyers search for marketplaces that are efficient, trustworthy, secure, and always-on, regardless of device. Our marketplaces are web-enabled, and cloud backed, accessible from Internet-enabled devices using a standard web browser. Our technology systems enable us to automate and streamline many of the manual processes associated with finding, evaluating, bidding on, paying for, and shipping surplus and salvage assets, retail overstocks and returns, and government owned real-estate. The technology and content behind our marketplaces and integrated value-added services were developed by us, providing us with flexibility and control over the marketplaces. This enables the ability to make enhancements quickly to better fit the specific needs of our buyers and sellers. Our infrastructure provides: 
•efficient channels to sell online through a variety of pricing mechanisms (standard auction, sealed bid, make an offer, fixed price, and a combination of fixed price and auction); 
•a scalable back office that enables buyers and sellers to efficiently manage transactions among remote business users by utilizing account management tools, including payment collection, invoicing management, shipping, and transaction settlement; and 
•an input/output agnostic platform, including Application Programming Interface or other conduits that enable us to scale and integrate seamlessly with partners of all sizes, from single asset sellers to Fortune 500 enterprises and third-party service providers. 
We have designed our websites and supporting infrastructure to be robust and to support new services and increased traffic. Our services leverage the scale and power of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure Public Cloud platforms. Our applications are designed with resiliency and fault tolerance in mind. Our network connectivity offers high performance and scalability to accommodate increases in website traffic. Since January 1, 2003, we have experienced no financially material service interruptions on our e-commerce marketplaces. 
Our applications support multiple layers of security, including password-protected logins, encryption technology to safeguard information transmitted in web sessions and firewalls to help prevent unauthorized access to our network and servers. We continue to invest in our security infrastructure to ensure it meets or exceeds industry standards for cybersecurity and employ dedicated resources to protect our systems. 
Further, we devote substantial resources to the continuous improvement of our technology and IT infrastructure which allows us to deliver value rapidly to our buyers, sellers, and internal employees. In fiscal year 2022, we continued to expand the capabilities of our flagship e-commerce platform, AllSurplus, enabling multiple user experience and back-office improvements. Customers now receive onsite alerts to notify them of event and invoice activity. These will provide a visual reminder of required actions to complete their auction purchase. We have also automated the invoice generation process, reducing the time between when an auction is concluded, and the buyer is prompted to pay. Additional product categories were added to the marketplaces' taxonomy to accommodate an ever-expanding field of assets.
For our existing marketplaces and services, we continue to deploy new capabilities to improve the customer experience, including a new unified header navigation that spans all marketplace properties. This new navigation element enables our customers to quickly switch between sites, aiding in the viewing of our comprehensive range of assets, and thereby maximizing the traffic benefits of our customer acquisition marketing. 
Our core back-office infrastructure is flexible by design. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we shifted to a remote work model. The cloud-based, flexible infrastructure has enabled our operations to continue, uninterrupted, in a variety of working models, including fully remote, on-site, and hybrid. This flexibility affords us the ability to recruit and retain outstanding talent and to service our customers’ needs regardless of location. 
Our customers are increasingly looking to our solutions to facilitate robust recovery for their assets, regardless of industry or location. We continue to develop intelligent solutions for our customers that facilitate rapid and secure transactions between buyer and seller, whether they are in the same town or across the globe. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in: 
•Our marketplace user experiences 
•Our seller tools - optimizing the interface for key industry verticals 
•Expanding our use of and Machine Learning to drive asset search and recommendations 
Our future growth depends on our continued ability to execute against these priorities. 
Operations
Supporting large organizations that have a recurring need to sell surplus and salvage assets requires systematic processes to enhance the financial value and convenience received by our sellers. We believe we have integrated the required operational processes into our solution to efficiently and to effectively support our buyers and sellers. Our operations group comprises three functions as follows: 
Buyer relations
Our buyer relations group supports the completion of buyer transactions by managing the buyer registration and qualification process, answering questions and requests from buyers, collecting buyer payments and resolving disputes. Our websites contain extensive information about buying through our e-commerce marketplaces, including an online tutorial regarding the use of our marketplaces, answers to frequently asked buyer questions and an indexed help section. Buyers can contact a buyer support service representative by live chat and e-mail or phone if they need additional support.
Shipping logistics
Our shipping logistics group manages and coordinates inbound and outbound shipping of merchandise for sellers and buyers of our Retail services. We offer, as part of our value-added services, integrated shipping services using our own fleet or multiple vetted and pre-qualified carrier partners. In addition, our shipping coordinators monitor the performance and service level of our network of carriers to help ensure speed and quality of service.
Distribution center and field service operations
Our distribution center and field service operations group perform selected pre-sale and post-sale value-added services at our distribution centers and at seller locations globally. These activities include unloading, manifesting and reporting discrepancies for all received assets and sales preparation of offered assets, including merchandising and organizing offered assets, writing product descriptions, capturing digital images and/or video and providing additional optional value-added services such as returns management (RM) services, return to vendor (RTV) services and product delabelling, data cleaning/wiping, testing, refurbishment and repackaging. Our distribution center and field service operations group personnel also arrange the outbound shipping or pick-up of purchased assets for our buyers.
Competition
The online services market for auctioning or liquidating surplus and salvage assets is competitive and growing rapidly. We compete with:
•other e-commerce platforms;
•auction, reverse auction, and direct sale websites;
•government agencies that have created websites to sell surplus and salvage assets; and
•traditional liquidators and fixed-site auctioneers.
In our marketplaces for surplus and salvage assets, we compete with a variety of online, mobile, and offline channels. These include, but are not limited to, e-commerce providers, B2B online marketplace platforms, auction websites, retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, and government agencies that have created websites to sell surplus. As our product offerings continue to broaden into new categories of surplus and salvage items, we expect to face additional competition from other online, mobile, and offline channels.
Our markets may become even more competitive as traditional and online liquidators and auctioneers continue to develop online and offline services for disposition, redeployment and remarketing of surplus and salvage assets. In addition, manufacturers, retailers and government agencies may create their own websites to sell their own surplus and salvage assets and those of third parties.
Competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices, may increase our competition. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits.
Our Vendor Contracts with Amazon.com, Inc. 
Our RSCG segment has multiple vendor contracts with Amazon.com, Inc., under which we acquire commercial merchandise to sell under the purchase model. The commercial merchandise we purchased under these contracts represented 55%, 61% and 55% of consolidated cost of goods sold for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Government Regulation
We are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. The growth and demand for e-commerce has resulted in and may continue to result in more stringent consumer protection laws and data privacy laws that impose additional compliance burdens on e-commerce companies. In particular, we continue to address changes in state, federal and international privacy laws and regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) in the European Union. Many jurisdictions also regulate "auctions" and "auctioneers" and may regulate online auction services. These consumer protection laws and regulations could cause substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business.
Intellectual Property
We regard our intellectual property, particularly domain names, copyrights and buyer database trade secrets, as critical to our success. We rely on contractual restrictions and copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights, know-how, information and technology. We currently are the registered owners of several Internet domain names, including www.liquidation.com, www.govdeals.com, www.allsurplus.com, www.secondipity.com, www.go-dove.com, www.machinio.com, www.machineryhost.com and www.bid4assets.com. We pursue the registration of our domain names in the U.S. and internationally. We have no patents or registered copyrights. Effective patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and domain name protection are expensive to maintain and may require litigation to enforce. 
Human Capital Management
In order to achieve our goal to build the world’s leading marketplace for surplus assets to benefit buyers, sellers, and the planet, it is crucial that we attract, develop and retain employees who deliver outstanding performance. To do so, we strive to make Liquidity Services a rewarding place to work and an environment where we promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. As of September 30, 2022, we had 735 employees worldwide, of which 91% were located in North America, 6% in the EMEA region, and 3% in the Asia-Pacific region. We also utilize temporary workers to augment staffing during peak business cycles and to fill certain open positions on a temporary basis. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
We believe our employees are key to achieving our business goals and growth strategy. Our human capital objective is to attract, retain, develop, and motivate talented employees. We use online search tools, specialized recruiting firms, employee referral programs, job postings in various media platforms, and university recruiting to identify and attract talented candidates. By doing so, we aim to leverage the variety of skills and perspectives inherent in a diverse workforce, improve our problem-solving abilities, and bring innovative solutions to a wider range of clients and customers.
Health and Well-Being
We value the health and well-being of our employees and provide generous benefit options to our employees and their families. Our plans are designed to enhance employee wellness by focusing on health, financial security, life, and learning. Our health benefits include multiple medical plans, dental and vision coverage, and paid parental leave. In the US, we pay a significant portion of the benefit premiums related to our health benefits. Employees are offered certain benefits at no charge to them or their families, e.g., Life and AD&D insurance, short- and long-term disability insurance, and Health Savings Account contributions. The financial security benefits program includes a 401(k) plan with discretionary employer match and access to health savings accounts and health and dependent care flexible spending accounts. We provide a range of insurance products and employee assistance programs. Internationally, we also offer a variety of benefit plans customized to reflect local conditions. Our learning and development programs include tuition support for employees and a global training and development program that focuses on leadership development, as well as training in various topics including diversity, anti-harassment, ethics, and regulatory compliance.

Supporting community outreach, disaster relief, zero-waste initiatives, youth mentoring, military families and veterans, and access to higher education.
Flexible Workspace 
The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we work. Roles that were able to work remotely continued to do so throughout 2022. We are committed to allowing flexibility in our workplace to promote high performance, retention, diversity, equity, and inclusion while also continuing to meet customer and business needs.
Sustainability Efforts 
At our core, Liquidity Services strives to benefit businesses, communities, and the environment through our marketplaces which enable the continued use of surplus and salvage assets that may otherwise wind up in landfills. These efforts extend to our employees as well, where our remote work structure for applicable employees has enabled lower expended energy and emissions from both transportation-related activities and operations across our real estate portfolio.
