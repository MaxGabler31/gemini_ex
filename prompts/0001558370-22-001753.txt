ITEM 1. Business
Comfort Systems USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was established in 1997. We provide mechanical and electrical contracting services. Our mechanical segment principally includes heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”), plumbing, piping and controls, as well as off-site construction, monitoring and fire protection. Our electrical segment includes installation and servicing of electrical systems. We build, install, maintain, repair and replace mechanical, electrical and plumbing (“MEP”) systems throughout our 41 operating units with 169 locations in 126 cities throughout the United States.
We operate primarily in the commercial, industrial and institutional MEP markets and perform most of our services in industrial, healthcare, education, office, technology, retail and government facilities. Substantially all of our consolidated 2021 revenue was derived from commercial, industrial and institutional customers and multi-family residential projects. Approximately 46.3% of our revenue was attributable to installation services in newly constructed facilities and 53.7% was attributable to renovation, expansion, maintenance, repair and replacement services in existing buildings. Our consolidated 2021 revenue was derived from the following service industries:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​
--------------------+---+---------------+--
​ | | Percentage of | 
Service Activity | ​ | Revenue | 
Mechanical Services | | 82.7 | %
Electrical Services | ​ | 17.3 | %
Total | | 100.0 | %

Industry Overview
We believe that commercial, industrial, and institutional mechanical and electrical contracting generate annual revenue in the United States of approximately $300 billion. Mechanical and electrical systems are necessary to virtually all commercial, industrial and institutional buildings. Because most buildings are sealed, HVAC systems provide the primary method of circulating fresh air in such buildings. Replacing an aging building’s existing systems with modern, energy-efficient systems significantly reduces a building’s energy consumption, carbon footprint, and operating costs while improving air quality and overall system effectiveness. Older commercial, industrial and institutional facilities frequently have poor air quality and provide less comfortable environments, and older HVAC systems result in significantly higher energy consumption than do modern systems. As electrical systems age they require service and replacement, and changing building configurations and technological power load requirements lead to the need to reconfigure and improve electrical systems in buildings on a regular basis.
Many factors affect mechanical and electrical services industry growth, including but not limited to, (i) population growth, which increases the need for commercial, industrial and institutional space, (ii) an aging installed base of buildings and equipment, (iii) increasing sophistication, complexity and efficiency of mechanical and electrical systems, and (iv) growing emphasis on internal air quality, environmental sustainability and energy efficiency.
Our industry can be broadly divided into two categories:

● | construction of and installation in new buildings, which provided approximately 46.3% of our revenue in 2021, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | renovation, expansion, maintenance, repair and replacement in existing buildings, which provided the remaining 53.7% of our 2021 revenue.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Construction, Installation, Expansion and Renovation Services— Construction, installation, expansion and renovation services consist of “design and build” and “plan and spec” projects. In “design and build” projects, the commercial MEP company is responsible for designing, engineering and installing a cost-effective, energy-efficient system customized to the specific needs of the building owner. Costs and other project terms are normally negotiated 

3




between the building owner or its representative and the contracting company. Companies that specialize in “design and build” projects use a consultative approach with customers and tend to develop long-term relationships with building owners and developers, general contractors, architects, consulting engineers and property managers. “Plan and spec” installation refers to projects in which a third-party architect or consulting engineer designs the MEP systems and the installation project is “put out for bid.” We believe that “plan and spec” projects usually take longer to complete and frequently results in less efficient outcomes than “design and build” projects because the system design and installation process are not integrated, thus resulting in more frequent adjustments to project specifications, work requirements and schedules. Our investments in design and building information modeling enable us to collaborate with our customers to achieve reliable and energy efficient construction outcomes and to eliminate unnecessary waste.
Maintenance, Repair and Replacement Services—These services include maintaining, repairing, replacing, reconfiguring and monitoring previously installed systems and building automation controls. The growth and aging of the installed base of MEP and related systems, changing requirements due to increasing technology deployment, and the demand for more efficient systems and more capable building automation controls have fueled growth in these services. The increasing complexity of these systems leads many commercial, industrial and institutional building owners and property managers to outsource maintenance and repair, often through service agreements with service providers. State-of-the-art control and monitoring systems feature electronic sensors and microprocessors that are crucial to energy efficient operations. These systems require specialized training to install, maintain and repair. We believe that the work that we perform to optimize and upgrade systems and to enable wise controls helps Comfort Systems USA to optimize energy use and fundamentally reduce our nation’s carbon footprint.
Strategy
We focus on strengthening core operating competencies, leading in sustainability, efficiency and technological improvement, and on increasing profit margins. The key objectives of our strategy are to improve profitability and generate growth in our operations, to enable sustainable and efficient building environments, to improve the productivity of our workforce, and to acquire complementary businesses. Specifically, we are currently focused on the following elements:
Achieve Excellence in Core Competencies—We have identified seven core competencies that we believe are critical to attracting and retaining customers, increasing operating income and cash flow, and maximizing the productivity of our skilled labor force. The seven core competencies are: (i) safety, (ii) customer service, (iii) design and build expertise, (iv) effective pre-construction processes, (v) job and cost tracking, (vi) leadership in energy efficient and sustainable design, and (vii) best-in-class servicing of existing building systems.
Achieve Operating Efficiencies—We think we can achieve operating efficiencies and cost savings through purchasing economies, adopting “best practices,” and focusing on efficient job management. We are continually improving the “job loop” at our locations—qualifying, estimating, pricing, and executing projects effectively and efficiently. We also use our combined spend to gain purchasing advantages on products and services such as MEP components, raw materials, services, vehicles, bonding, insurance, and employee benefits.
Attract, Retain and Invest in our Employees—We seek to attract and retain quality employees by providing them an enhanced career path that offers a stable income, attractive benefits packages, and excellent growth opportunities. We continually invest in training, including programs for project managers, field superintendents, service managers, service technicians, sales managers, estimators, and leadership and development of key managers and leaders. We believe that skilled labor forces in the building and services trades have become increasingly scarce and valuable, and we are increasingly focused on growing and improving our skilled labor force, including through recruitment, development, and skills training for our hourly workers.
Focus on Industrial, Commercial and Institutional Markets—We focus on the industrial, commercial, and institutional building markets, including construction, maintenance, repair, and replacement services. We believe that these complex markets are attractive because of their growth opportunities, large and diverse customer base, attractive margins, and potential for long-term relationships with building owners.
Leverage Resources and Capabilities—We believe significant operating efficiencies can be achieved by leveraging resources among our operating locations. We have shifted certain fabrication activities to centralized locations to increase asset utilization. We opportunistically allocate our engineering, field, and supervisory labor from 

4




one operation to another to use our employee base more fully, meet our customers’ needs and share expertise. Our ability to share resources frequently allows us to pursue work that would otherwise not be available to us and allows us to provide a more diversified and steady deployment of our labor. We believe we have realized scale benefits from coordinated purchasing, technical innovation, insurance, benefits, bonding, and financing activities across our operations.
Maintain a Diverse Customer, Geographic, and Project Base—We have a distribution of revenue across end-use sectors that we believe reduces our exposure to negative developments in any given sector. We also have significant geographical diversification across all regions of the United States, again reducing our exposure to negative developments in any given region. Our distribution of revenue in 2021 by end-use sector was as follows:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​
--------------------------------------+---+-------+--
Industrial | | 44.1 | %
Education | | 12.7 | %
Office Buildings | | 10.1 | %
Healthcare | | 13.6 | %
Government | | 5.7 | %
Retail, Restaurants and Entertainment | | 6.9 | %
Multi-Family and Residential | | 3.7 | %
Other | | 3.2 | %
Total | | 100.0 | %

​
Approximately 86.7% of our revenue is earned on a project basis for installation of systems in newly constructed or existing facilities. As of December 31, 2021, we had 7,831 projects in process with an aggregate contract value of approximately $6.3 billion. Our average project takes six to nine months to complete, with an average contract price of approximately $802,000. This average project size, when taken together with the approximately 13.3% of our revenue derived from maintenance and service, provides us with a broad base of work in the construction services sector. A stratification of projects in progress as of December 31, 2021, by contract price, is as follows:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
--------------------------+---+----------+---+-------------+---------+--
​ | | ​ | | Aggregate | 
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | Contract | 
​ | ​ | No. of | ​ | Price Value | 
Contract Price of Project | ​ | Projects | ​ | (millions) | 
Under $1 million | | 6,864 | ​ | $ | 841.0 | ​
$1 million - $5 million | | 679 | ​ | | 1,527.5 | ​
$5 million - $10 million | | 158 | ​ | | 1,084.8 | ​
$10 million - $15 million | | 53 | ​ | | 661.2 | ​
Greater than $15 million | | 77 | ​ | | 2,167.6 | ​
Total | | 7,831 | ​ | $ | 6,282.1 | ​

Develop and Adopt Leading Technologies—We are improving productivity by increasing use of innovative techniques in prefabrication, project design and planning, as well as in coordination and production methods. We have invested in the refinement and adoption of prefabrication practices. We work to identify, develop, and implement new materials, products and methods that can achieve greater productivity and more efficient and sustainable outcomes. Above all, we have concluded that as technology develops in our industry the fundamental prerequisite for leadership is adopting such opportunities in the quality, accuracy, and buildability of our designs. Accordingly, we have invested in the experts, training, and internal and external knowledge transfer to ensure that we are properly scaling, achieving true buildability, and fundamentally and continuously improving our design capabilities to meet our customers’ evolving requirements. Our goal is to use our scale and strategic investments to maintain a leading position in design and modeling excellence, optimize productivity and quality, and ultimately position ourselves to capitalize from ongoing or future technological developments. 
Excel at Modular and Off-Site Construction—We believe that modular and off-site construction – the ability to build superior quality plants and systems away from the construction site – will become increasingly important in complex construction projects. Accordingly, through our acquisitions, we have invested in that capability, and after acquisition we have further invested in improving and growing that service offering. This has led to meaningful growth in our ability to provide this expertise. Through recent and ongoing development and acquisitions, we plan to continue to improve on our unmatched capability in mechanical off-site or modular construction.

Service Growth Initiative—Over the last several years we have made substantial investments to expand our service and maintenance revenue by increasing the value we can offer to service and maintenance customers. We are actively concentrating managerial and sales resources on training and hiring experienced employees to sell and profitably perform service work. In many locations we have added or upgraded our capability, and we believe our investments and efforts have provided customer value and stimulated growth in all aspects of our businesses.
Seek Growth through Acquisitions—We believe that we can further increase our cash flow and operating income by continuing to opportunistically enter new markets or service lines through acquisition. We have dedicated a significant portion of our cash flow on an ongoing basis to seeking opportunities to acquire businesses that have strong assembled workforces, excellent historical safety performance, leading design and energy efficiency capabilities, attractive market positions, a record of consistent positive cash flow, and desirable market locations.
Operations and Services Provided
We provide a wide range of construction, renovation, expansion, maintenance, repair and replacement services for MEP and related systems in commercial, industrial and institutional properties. Our local management teams maintain responsibility for day-to-day operating decisions. Local management is augmented by regional leadership that focuses on core business competencies, regional financial performance, cooperation and coordination between locations, implementing best practices and corporate initiatives. In addition to senior management, local personnel generally include design engineers, energy efficiency and sustainability experts, sales personnel, customer service personnel, installation and service technicians, sheet metal and prefabrication technicians, estimators and administrative personnel. We have centralized certain administrative functions such as insurance, employee benefits, training, safety programs, marketing and cash management to enable our local operating management to focus on pursuing new business opportunities and improving operating efficiencies. 
Construction and Installation Services for New Buildings—Our installation business related to newly constructed facilities, which comprised approximately 46.3% of our consolidated 2021 revenue, involves the design, engineering, integration, installation and start-up of MEP and related systems. We provide “design and build” and “plan and spec” installation services for office buildings, retail centers, manufacturing plants, healthcare, education and government facilities and other commercial, industrial and institutional facilities. In a “design and build” installation, we work with the customer to determine the needed capacity and to optimize energy efficiency of the MEP systems that best suit the proposed facility. The final design, terms, price and timing of the project are then negotiated with the customer or its representatives, after which any necessary modifications are made to the system plan. In “plan and spec” installation, we participate in a bid process to provide labor, equipment, materials and installation based on the end user’s plans and engineering specifications.
Once an agreement has been reached, we order the necessary materials and equipment for delivery to meet the project schedule. In many instances we fabricate ductwork, conduit and piping and assemble certain components for the system based on the mechanical drawing specifications. Finally, we install the systems at the project site, working closely with the owner or general contractor. Our average project takes six to nine months to complete, with an average contract price of approximately $802,000. We also perform larger project work, with 967 contracts in progress at December 31, 2021 with contract prices in excess of $1 million. Our largest project in progress at December 31, 2021 had a contract price of $78.3 million. Project contracts typically provide for periodic billings to the customer as we meet progress milestones or incur cost on the project. Project contracts in our industry also frequently allow for a small portion of progress billings or contract price to be withheld by the customer until after we have completed the work. Amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage.
Renovation, Expansion, Maintenance, Monitoring, Repair and Replacement Services for Existing Buildings—Our renovation, expansion, maintenance, monitoring, repair and replacement services in existing buildings comprised approximately 53.7% of our consolidated 2021 revenue. Maintenance and repair services are provided either in response to service calls or under a service agreement. Service calls are coordinated by customer service representatives or dispatchers that use computer and communication technology to process orders, arrange service calls, dispatch technicians and communicate with and invoice customers. Service technicians work from service vehicles equipped with commonly used parts, supplies and tools to complete a variety of jobs. Optimal maintenance is crucial to energy efficient operations. Commercial, industrial and institutional service agreements usually have terms of one or more years, with automatic annual renewals, and frequently include thirty- to sixty-day cancellation notice periods. We also provide remote monitoring of power usage, temperature, pressure, humidity and air flow for MEP and other building systems.

Sources of Supply
The raw materials and components we use include MEP system components, ductwork, pipe, conduit, wire, electrical fixtures, steel, sheet metal and copper tubing and piping. These raw materials and components are generally available from a variety of domestic or foreign suppliers at competitive prices. In ordinary times, delivery times are typically short for most raw materials and standard components, but during periods of peak demand, including the ongoing pandemic, may extend one month to several months. We estimate that direct purchase of commodities and finished products comprises between 35% and 40% of our average project cost. We have procedures to reduce commodity cost exposure such as purchasing commodities early for projects, as well as selectively including time or market-based escalation and escape provisions in bids and contracts.
Chillers for large applications typically have the longest delivery time and frequently have lead times of up to six months. The major components of commercial MEP systems are compressors and chillers that are manufactured primarily by Carrier, Lennox, Daikin, Trane, and York. The major suppliers of building automation control systems are Automated Logic, Cisco, Delta, Distech Controls, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell Automation, Schneider Electric, Siemens, Trane, and York. The major suppliers of electrical switchgear and generators are Caterpillar, Cummins, Eaton and Schneider Electric. We do not have any significant contracts guaranteeing us a supply of raw materials or components.
Cyclicality and Seasonality
The construction industry is subject to business cycle fluctuation. As a result, our volume of business, particularly in new construction projects and renovation, may be adversely affected by declines in new installation and replacement projects in various geographic regions of the United States during periods of economic weakness.
The mechanical and electrical contracting industries are also subject to seasonal variations. The demand for new installation and replacement is generally lower during the winter months (the first quarter of the year) due to reduced construction activity during inclement weather and less use of air conditioning during the colder months. Demand for our services is generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters due to increased construction activity and increased use of air conditioning during the warmer months. Accordingly, we expect our revenue and operating results generally will be lower in the first calendar quarter. 
Sales and Marketing
We have a diverse customer base, with our top customer representing 9% of consolidated 2021 revenue, and our largest customer often changes from year to year. Management and a dedicated sales force are responsible for developing and maintaining successful long-term relationships with key customers. Customers generally include building owners and developers and property managers, as well as general contractors, architects and consulting engineers. We intend to continue our emphasis on developing and maintaining long-term relationships with our customers by providing superior, high-quality service in a professional manner. We believe we can continue to leverage the diverse technical and marketing strengths at individual locations to expand the services offered in other local markets. With respect to multi-location service opportunities, we maintain a national sales force in our national accounts group.
Human Capital Resources
Employees—As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 13,200 employees as compared to approximately 11,100 employees as of December 31, 2020. We have collective bargaining agreements covering less than ten employees. We have not experienced and do not expect any significant strikes or work stoppages and believe our relations with employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are good.
Culture and Core Values—Our values define, inform, and guide the way we operate both within our Company and in the communities where we do business. Our core values are to be safe; be honest; be respectful; be innovative; and be collaborative. These values set the foundation for our Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees, officers, and directors of the Comfort Systems USA family of companies. The Code of Conduct is regularly reinforced to the Company’s employees and management through periodic ethics, equal opportunity employment, and anti-corruption trainings. In addition, certain business partners, such as consultants, agents, suppliers, contractors, and other third 

7




parties, serve as an extension of the Company. They are expected to follow the spirit of our Code of Conduct, all applicable laws, and any applicable contractual provisions when working on our behalf. 
We believe that the way we conduct business is just as important as the business we do. Operating with integrity helps us deliver on the promises we have made to each other, our customers, and the communities where we live and work. It is also the basis for ensuring continued growth and success. Everyone at our Company shares a responsibility for doing business ethically and in a sustainable manner, preserving our good name. We ensure that this responsibility applies at every level in our organization, and everyone from corporate officers to members of our Board of Directors, to our field personnel is responsible for overseeing these efforts.
Recruiting and Training—Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified engineers, service technicians, field supervisors and project managers. We believe our success in retaining qualified employees will be based on the quality of our recruiting, training, compensation, employee benefits programs and opportunities for advancement. We provide numerous training programs for management, sales, and leadership, as well as on-the-job training, technical training, apprenticeship programs, attractive benefit packages and career advancement opportunities within our Company.
Safety—We have established comprehensive safety programs throughout our operations to ensure that all employees comply with safety standards we have established and that are established under federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Safety leadership establishes safety programs and benchmarking to improve safety across the Company. Additionally, our employment screening process seeks to determine that prospective employees have requisite skills, sufficient background references and acceptable driving records, if applicable. Our rate of incidents recordable under the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) per one hundred employees per year, also known as the OSHA recordable rate, was 1.28 during 2021. This level was 42% better than the most recently published OSHA rate for our industry.
Diversity and Inclusion—We are an equal opportunity employer, and we welcome and celebrate our teams’ differences, experiences, and beliefs. We expect all employees to be treated with dignity and respect in an environment free from discrimination and harassment regardless of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other protected class. We know that diversity is truly a competitive advantage that helps drive growth and innovation, and we have increasingly focused on diversity and inclusion programs within our Company. Diversity and inclusion are among our leadership team’s top priorities, with clearly outlined near-term actions to accelerate progress in outreach, representation, development, and advancement of underrepresented groups within our Company. Our Board of Directors and Board committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters, including our diversity and inclusion strategy.
Insurance and Litigation
The primary insured risks in our operations are bodily injury, property damage and workers’ compensation injuries. We retain the risk for workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, auto liability, general liability and employee group health claims resulting from uninsured deductibles per-incident or occurrence. Because we have very large per incident deductibles, the vast majority of our claims are paid by us, so as a practical matter we self-insure the great majority of these risks. Losses up to such per-incident deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts, historical trends and industry averages using the assistance of an actuary to project the extent of these obligations.
We are subject to certain claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. We maintain various insurance coverages to minimize financial risk associated with these claims. We have estimated and provided accruals for probable losses and related legal fees associated with certain litigation in our consolidated financial statements. While we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, in our opinion and based on reports of counsel, any liability arising from these matters individually and in the aggregate will not have a material effect on our operating results, cash flows or financial condition, after giving effect to provisions already recorded.
We typically warrant labor for the first year after installation on new MEP systems that we build and install, and we pass through to the customer manufacturers’ warranties on equipment. We generally warrant labor for thirty days after servicing existing MEP systems. We do not expect warranty claims to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Competition
The mechanical and electrical contracting industries are highly competitive and consist of thousands of local and regional companies. We believe that purchasing decisions in the commercial, industrial, and institutional markets are based on (i) competitive price, (ii) relationships, (iii) quality, timeliness, and reliability, (iv) tenure, financial strength, and access to bonding, (v) range of capabilities, and (vi) scale of operation. To improve our competitive position, we focus on both the consultative “design and build” installation market and the maintenance, repair, and replacement market to develop and strengthen customer relationships. In addition, we believe our ability to provide multi-location coverage and a broad range of services gives us a strategic advantage over smaller competitors who may have more limited resources and capabilities.
We believe that we are larger than most of our competitors, which are generally small, owner-operated companies in a specific area. However, there are divisions of larger contracting companies, utilities and MEP equipment manufacturers that provide MEP services in some of the same service lines and geographic areas we serve. Some of these competitors and potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do to finance development opportunities and support their operations. We believe our smaller competitors generally compete with us based on price and their long-term relationships with local customers. Our larger competitors compete with us on those factors but may also provide attractive financing and comprehensive service and product packages.
Vehicles
We operate a fleet of various owned or leased service trucks, vans and support vehicles. We believe these vehicles generally are well maintained and sufficient for our current operations.
Climate Change and Sustainability
We recognize our environmental and societal responsibilities and are committed to sustainability and to improving our environmental footprint as well as operating our business in a manner that seeks to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers, as well as the public. Our focus on environmental stewardship and improving productivity drives not only our efforts to become more energy efficient but also improvements in our customers' impact on climate change. Replacing an aging building’s existing systems with modern, energy-efficient systems significantly reduces a building’s energy consumption and carbon footprint while improving cost, air quality, and overall system effectiveness.
We are subject to the requirements of numerous federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and rules that promote the protection of the environment. While capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate that they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position in the short term. 
Additionally, we plan to increase our voluntary reporting through submissions to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). Such additional disclosures are a continuation of our efforts to adhere to voluntary reporting standards – for example, in 2021, we received a bronze medal as a result of our initial EcoVadis submission, and we published our first sustainability report (i) using the Sustainability Accounting Standard Board’s (“SASB”) standards for the Engineering and Construction Services industry, and (ii) in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards: Core option.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including: (i) licensing requirements applicable to engineering, construction and service technicians, (ii) building and MEP codes and zoning ordinances, (iii) regulations relating to consumer protection, including those governing residential service agreements, (iv) special bidding and procurement requirements on government projects, (v) wage and hour regulations, and (vi) regulations relating to worker safety and protection of the environment. For example, our operations are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state laws directed towards protection of employees. We believe we have all required licenses to conduct our operations and are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses.

Many state and local regulations governing the MEP services trades require individuals to hold permits and licenses. In some cases, a required permit or license held by a single individual may be sufficient to authorize specified activities for all of our service technicians who work in the state or county that issued the permit or license. We seek to ensure that, where possible, we have two employees who hold any such permits or licenses that may be material to our operations in a particular geographic region.
Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, which governs air emissions and imposes specific requirements on the use and handling of ozone-depleting refrigerants generally classified as chlorofluorocarbons (“CFCs”) or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (“HCFCs”). Clean Air Act regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”) require the certification of service technicians involved in the service or repair of equipment containing these refrigerants and also regulate the containment and recycling of these refrigerants. These requirements have increased our training expenses and expenditures for containment and recycling equipment. The Clean Air Act is intended ultimately to eliminate the use of ozone-depleting substances such as CFCs and HCFCs in the United States and to require alternative refrigerants to be used in replacement HVAC systems. Some replacement refrigerants, already in use, and classified as hydrofluorocarbons (“HFCs”) are not ozone-depleting substances. HFCs are considered by USEPA to have high global warming potential. USEPA may at some point require the phase-out of HFCs and expand existing technician certification requirements to cover the handling of HFCs. We do not believe the existing regulations governing technician certification requirements for the handling of ozone-depleting substances or possible future regulations applicable to HFCs will materially affect our business on the whole because, although they require us to incur modest ongoing training costs, our competitors also incur such costs, and such regulations may encourage or require our customers to update their MEP systems.
