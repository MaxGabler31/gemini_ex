Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are one of the world’s leading clinical contract research organizations, or CROs, by revenue, solely focused on providing scientifically-driven outsourced clinical development services to the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Our mission is to accelerate the global development of safe and effective medical therapeutics. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by our disciplined operating model centered on providing full-service Phase I-IV clinical development services and our therapeutic expertise. We believe this combination results in timely and cost-effective delivery of clinical development services for our customers. We believe that we are a partner of choice for small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies based on our ability to consistently utilize our full-service, disciplined operating model to deliver timely and high-quality results for our customers. Accordingly, our business strategy aims to continue to expand our market share in the growing Phase I-IV CRO market as we conduct clinical trials across all major therapeutic areas, with particular strength in Oncology, Metabolic Disease, Cardiology, Antiviral and Anti-infective (AVAI) and Central Nervous System (CNS).
Our Revenues: Markets and Clinical Development Services
 Before a new drug can be commercialized, it often must undergo extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing and regulatory review to verify safety and efficacy. CROs provide a comprehensive range of product development services for Phase I-IV clinical trials. These clinical trials are separated into distinct phases in order to thoroughly evaluate the product. We generate our revenues by providing a full suite of services supporting the entire clinical development process from Phase I to Phase IV across a wide range of therapeutic areas.
Medical Department: Our medical department consists of therapeutic leads who provide strategic direction for study design and planning, train operational staff, work with primary investigators, provide medical monitoring and meet with regulatory agencies.
Clinical Trial Management: Our team of clinical trial managers (CTMs) lead all aspects of study execution and drive accountability across the functional team members. Our CTMs use ClinTrak, our proprietary information management system for clinical trials, which is integrated with our standard operating procedures (SOPs), allowing the CTMs to access real-time study metrics.
 Data-Driven Feasibility: Our dedicated feasibility team of clinical experts analyze specific protocols, using many data sources to determine countries and sites that are most appropriate for the study.
 Study Start-Up: Our global Study Start-Up staff conducts trial start up activities, including study documentation submission processes to independent Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, ethics committees and to ex-US competent authorities. Our study start-up team includes fully dedicated budget and legal associates to ensure focused negotiations and execution of site contracts.
 Patient Recruitment and Retention: We navigate the complexities of patient recruitment and retention by providing strategic solutions that address clinical program needs. Our patient recruitment and retention department identify patient motivators and any potential barriers to join and remain in the clinical research study.
 Clinical Monitoring: Our clinical research associates, or CRAs, provide site management services including in-house, onsite and virtual monitoring. Their knowledge of local regulations and laws, in addition to Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, guidelines ensure compliance and data quality. CRAs report into a global matrix structure and receive comprehensive, hands-on training
-  -


in an individualized curriculum consisting of in-house and field-based training, supplemented with clinical research department core rotations and ongoing study-specific training.
 Risk-Based Monitoring: We support a comprehensive approach to monitoring to ensure adequate protection of the rights, welfare, and safety of human subjects and the quality and integrity of the study. This approach focuses on prevention and mitigation of important and likely risks and is part of the overarching surveillance utilized to manage studies.
 Regulatory Affairs: We provide expert strategic, operational, and tactical regulatory guidance, and create thorough scientifically-grounded regulatory compliant documentation at each stage of the drug and biologics development process to regulatory agencies around the globe.
 Medical Writing: Medical writers work closely with our medical experts, biostatisticians, and other members of the study team to develop study protocols, clinical and statistical study reports, and integrated submission documents according to regulatory guidelines.
Biometrics and Data Sciences:  We provide high-quality data collected during clinical trials that supports regulatory submissions, including NDAs or Biologics License Application for approval by the FDA, or a similar marketing authorization application for approval by non-U.S. regulatory agencies. Our data science team develops detailed specifications for the collection, organization, validation, analysis and quality control of clinical trial data. Our biostatisticians provide trial design consulting, statistical methodology recommendations, programming expertise and reporting accuracy.
Pharmacovigilance: Our safety and pharmacovigilance group collects, evaluates, analyzes and reports safety information. We provide global adverse event management, physician reviewed safety narrative writing and custom safety surveillance.
 Core Laboratory: Our core laboratory services include both imaging services and cardiovascular core laboratory services. We partner with imaging experts from major academic and clinical institutions involved in research to provide image reading in a secure environment utilizing identical software and
-  -


workstations integrated into ClinTrak allowing for prompt turnaround and oversight. Our cardiovascular core laboratory provides state of the art standardized electrocardiogram services and data analysis.
 Central Laboratory: Our Central Laboratory operates in four locations, including Cincinnati, Ohio; Leuven, Belgium; Shanghai, China; and Singapore. The Central Laboratory has longstanding core competency in specialized esoteric testing, including biomarkers for efficacy in addition to standard assay offerings. We also provide biorepository services offering solutions for comprehensive specimen life cycle management, and molecular and genetic testing for detection of pathogenic events at the genome level including viral load and viral shedding.
 Bioanalytical Laboratory. Our Bioanalytical Laboratory is located on our clinical research campus in Cincinnati, Ohio. Working in a Good Laboratory Practice compliant setting following FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, guidelines, the Bioanalytical Laboratory delivers method transfer, development, validation, sample analysis and metabolite screening and identification of pre-clinical and clinical biological samples with expertise in developing proprietary, highly scientific, esoteric and sensitive tests for small and large molecules.
Clinics: Our clinics conduct studies in normal healthy volunteers, special populations, and patient populations over a spectrum of diseases and is located on our clinical research campus in Cincinnati, Ohio.
Quality Assurance: Our quality assurance team works closely with study teams to ensure compliance with protocols, SOPs and regulatory guidelines to ultimately protect research subject safety as well as the integrity and validity of study data. Our quality assurance team also provides services including regulatory training, internal system audits, SOP oversight, hosting of audits and regulatory inspections, as well as performs third party audits of critical vendors and investigative sites on behalf of our customers.
 Customers
 We have a well-diversified, attractively-positioned customer base that includes small biopharmaceutical companies, mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies and large pharmaceutical companies.
We have in the past and may in the future enter into arrangements with our customers or other drug, biologic or medical device companies in which we take on payment risk by making strategic investments in our customers or other drug companies, providing flexible payment terms or fee financing to customers or other companies, or entering into other risk sharing arrangements on trial execution.

Sales and Marketing
 We employ an integrated sales and marketing team to sell our services to biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device companies. The team consists of professional business development representatives focused on securing business from both new and existing customers, through a consultative and strategic sales approach. We embed our medical and scientific experts from the beginning of the sales process when we first engage potential customers.
 -  -


As part of our sales strategy, our team focuses on a customer segmentation model. Our team targets and engages customers in our addressable market, matches customer characteristics with therapeutic fit and maintains a mindset of full-service outsourcing. Our structured and disciplined approach facilitates strong account evaluation, which results in increased focus by the sales team, the development of effective and productive territories, the management of sales force effectiveness and the creation of a process whereby both marketing and sales operate under the same guiding principles.
 We consult collaboratively with our customers and help optimize timely completion of their clinical trials and programs, in part, because we engage our therapeutic experts, regulatory affairs experts and operations team throughout the clinical trial process. Our sales team is then able to take the study design, regulatory plan and execution plan discussed up front and carry that through to the proposal and provide a final concept during one-on-one customer discussions and final CRO evaluations.
 Our marketing team supports the business development function in three key areas, generating brand awareness through customized campaigns and web-site development, conference planning and lead generation through market research and business intelligence analysis. All of our sales and marketing data are housed within a third party customer relationship management tool that provides us the analytics we need to make sales planning and sales management decisions.
 Competition
 We compete primarily against other full-service CROs as well as services provided by in-house research and development (R&D) departments of biopharmaceutical companies. Our major CRO competitors include Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, ICON plc, Syneos Health, Inc., PAREXEL International Corporation, PPD, Inc. (now part of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), IQVIA Holdings Inc. and numerous specialty and regional CROs.
 We generally compete on the basis of a number of factors, including experience within specific therapeutic areas, quality of staff and services, reliability, range of provided services, ability to recruit principal investigators and patients into studies expeditiously, ability to organize and manage large-scale, global clinical trials, global presence with strategically located facilities, speed to completion, price and overall value. We believe we compete effectively with our competitors across these factors, particularly due to our full-service operating model, our deep therapeutic expertise in areas that are among the largest, most complex and fastest growing in pharmaceutical development, our global platform and our experienced and committed management team.
 The CRO industry remains fragmented, with several hundred smaller, narrowly focused service providers and a small number of full-service companies with global capabilities. We believe there are significant barriers to others becoming a global provider offering a broad range of services and products including the cost and experience necessary to develop strong therapeutic areas, expertise to manage complex clinical programs, infrastructure to support large global programs, ability to deliver high-quality services and expertise required to prepare regulatory submissions in numerous jurisdictions.
 Government Regulation
 Development of Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices
 The development of drugs, biologics and medical devices is highly regulated in the United States and other countries. Our services are subject to varying regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the pre-clinical and clinical trial process. In the United States, the FDA has primary authority to regulate these activities, in addition to the approval process, and the subsequent manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping and marketing for these products, which are the responsibility of our customers. Before a marketing application for a drug is ready for submission to regulatory authorities, the candidate drug must often undergo rigorous testing in clinical trials. In the United States, these trials must be conducted in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, its implementing regulations, and other federal and state requirements that require the drug to be tested and studied in certain ways prior to approval. The FDA has similar authority and requirements with respect to the clinical testing of biological products and medical devices. Before a human clinical trial may begin in the United States, the manufacturer or sponsor of the clinical product candidate must file an Investigational
-  -


New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA, which contains, among other things, the results of pre-clinical tests, manufacturer information and other analytical data. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Each clinical trial must be conducted pursuant to, and in accordance with, an effective IND. Each human clinical trial we conduct is subject to the oversight of an IRB, which is an independent committee that has the regulatory authority to review, approve and monitor a clinical trial for which the IRB has responsibility. The FDA and IRB receive reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing and may require the modification, suspension, or termination of clinical trials if, among other things, an unreasonable risk is presented to patients or if the design of the trial is insufficient to meet its stated objective. In addition, information about certain clinical trials must be made publicly available on the federal government website, www.clinicaltrials.gov.
 In the United States, GCP regulations govern the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. In order to comply with GCP and other requirements, we must, among other things:
 comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified principal investigators and clinical research sites;
 obtain specific written commitments from principal investigators;
 obtain IRB review and approval and supervision of the clinical trials by an independent review board or ethics committee;
 obtain a favorable opinion from regulatory agencies to commence a clinical trial;
 verify that appropriate patient informed consents are obtained before the patient participates in a clinical trial;
 ensure that adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner;
 monitor the validity and accuracy of data;
 monitor drug or biologic accountability at clinical research sites; and
 verify that principal investigators and clinical trial staff maintain records and reports and permit appropriate governmental authorities access to data for review.
 Clinical trials conducted outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted. These laws and regulations may or may not be similar to the laws and regulations administered by the FDA and other laws and regulations regarding the protection of patient safety and privacy and the control of clinical trial pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other clinical trial materials. Within the EU, these requirements are enforced by the EMA and requirements may vary slightly from one member state to another. In Canada, clinical trials are regulated by the Health Products and Food Branch of Health Canada as well as provincial regulations. Similar requirements also apply in other jurisdictions, including countries outside the EU and countries in Asia and Latin America where we operate or where our customers may intend to apply for marketing authorization. Clinical trials conducted outside the United States also may be subject to FDA regulation if the clinical trials are conducted pursuant to an IND or an Investigational Device Exemption for a product candidate that will seek FDA approval or clearance. In addition, clinical trial sponsors follow ICH E6 guidelines as a principle for GCP.
 The clinical trial customer and the parties conducting the clinical trials share in responsibilities to ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled. Many of the functions we regularly perform in the conduct of clinical trials subject us directly to regulations (e.g., compliance with GCP), and in some circumstances, we will take on legal and regulatory responsibility either through a transfer of obligations to us from our clinical trial customers or our acting as local legal representative for certain of our clinical trial customers. We may be subject to regulatory action if we fail to comply with these requirements. Failure to comply with certain regulations may also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials. For example, violations of GCP could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning letter, suspension or termination of a clinical trial, refusal of the FDA to approve clinical trial or marketing applications or withdrawal of such applications, injunction, seizure of investigational products, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications.
-  -


We monitor our clinical trials to test for compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the United States and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have adopted SOPs that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements and serve as a mechanism for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. In the United States, our procedures were developed to ensure compliance with GCP and associated requirements.
 Health Information Privacy
 The confidentiality of personal health information, including patient-specific information collected during clinical trials, is heavily regulated in the United States and other countries. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has promulgated rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and their implementing regulations, including the Privacy and Security Rules, or collectively, HIPAA, that govern the use, handling and disclosure of personally identifiable medical information. These regulations also establish procedures for the exercise of an individual’s rights and the methods permissible for de-identification of health information. HIPAA applies to “covered entities,” which include certain types of healthcare providers, as well as service providers to covered entities which access protected health information, known as “business associates.” Two of our subsidiaries, Medpace Clinical Pharmacology, LLC and C-MARC, LLC, are covered entities under HIPAA. Further, many investigators with whom we are involved in clinical trials are also directly subject to HIPAA as covered entities. There are instances where we may be considered a business associate of a covered entity investigator, and we have signed business associate agreements with some investigators. If we are determined to be a business associate, we would be directly liable for any breaches of protected health information and other HIPAA violations. We are also liable contractually under any business associate agreements we have signed with covered entities. In addition, we are also subject to privacy legislation in Canada under the federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector and the Personal Health Information Protection Act and privacy legislation in the EU under the 95/46/EC Privacy Directive on the protection and free movement of personal data, as replaced by the General Data Protection Regulation from early 2018 onwards.
Health Industry Arrangements
 The conduct of pre-clinical and clinical trials may be subject to laws and regulations that are intended to prevent the misuse of government healthcare program funding. In the United States, these laws include, among others, the False Claims Act, which prohibits submitting or causing the submission of false statements or improper claims for government healthcare program payments; and the Anti-Kickback statute, which prohibits paying, offering to pay or receiving payment with the intent to induce the referral of services or items that are covered under a federal healthcare program. Violations of these laws and regulations may incur administrative, civil, and criminal penalties.
Environmental Regulation and Liability
 We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety in the countries in which we do business, including laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. Our operations include the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials and medical wastes. We may, in the future, incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations for contamination of sites we own or operate (including contamination caused by prior owners or operators of such sites), the off-site disposal of hazardous substances and for personal injuries or property damage arising from exposure to hazardous materials from our operations. We believe that we have been and are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and that we currently have no liabilities under such environmental requirements that could reasonably be expected to materially harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Intellectual Property
 We develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements to protect our trade secrets, and copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We have obtained or applied for trademarks and copyright protection in the
-  -


United States and in a number of foreign countries. Our material trademarks include Medpace and ClinTrak. Although the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country, trademarks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2021 we had approximately 4,500 employees located across 41 countries. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had approximately 3,600 and 3,500 employees, respectively. Our associates are our most important asset and we recognize the importance of motivating and rewarding our associates by providing them with competitive benefits as part of their overall compensation and benefits package. We have developed comprehensive benefits packages that deliver quality and value while satisfying the diverse needs of our workforce and meeting local market requirements and expectations.
 Attracting, developing, retaining and advancing talent at all levels at Medpace is a key component to sustaining our organic growth and continuing our mission. We strive to maintain a culture of diversity and inclusion in which people from all backgrounds can fully contribute to the growth and success of our business. As such, we are committed to maintaining a respectful work environment, providing equal opportunity and the fair treatment of all individuals on the basis of merit, without regard for gender, race, color, creed, religion, family status, age, national origin or ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, veteran status, citizenship, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other protected group status. Anti-discrimination, anti-harassment and anti-retaliation policies are applicable to all employees and are set forth in the Medpace Code of Conduct. All employees are responsible for upholding the Medpace Code of Conduct, which forms the foundation of our personnel and ethics policies and practices.
 We have developed a strong record of hiring and developing women at all levels of the organization. Approximately 70% of our employees globally are women representing 64% of management and 52% of director level and above positions. In addition, of our U.S. based employees, approximately 17% are non-white, including 12% of management. None of our US employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement specific to our Company.
 Our commitment to compliance, people, safety, communities and the environment is further described in our 2019-2020 Corporate Responsibility Report published within the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.medpace.com. That Report is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Recruitment and Retention
 The success of our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified professional, scientific and technical staff. The level of competition among employers in the United States and globally for skilled personnel, particularly for those with Ph.D., M.D. or equivalent degrees or training, is high. We believe that our brand recognition and our multinational presence are advantages in attracting qualified candidates. We also believe that the wide range of clinical trials in which we participate allows us to offer broad experience to clinical researchers. Our disciplined and centralized approach to hiring, training, and development of employees has fostered, and we believe will continue to foster, strong employee loyalty. Retention of experienced employees is important to maintaining our growth and our high quality of service over time.
As our associates develop knowledge and skills that will contribute to the wider Medpace mission and business success, we believe in rewarding strong performance with compensatory and non-compensatory recognition. We have a robust career path and compensation structure that acknowledges associate performance and development at all levels of the organization. Of the 442 management-level roles that were newly filled in 2021, approximately 53% of these roles were filled by our pipeline of internal talent.
Development
 We have a history of identifying talented individuals and training them to excel in our disciplined operating model. Dedicated training and development teams are focused on creating, facilitating, and evaluating the success of training programs across functional areas. We have invested in the development and implementation of a global
-  -


learning management system which is universally used to record regulatory compliance, capture attendance at instructor led training sessions, deliver online training content, proctor online exams, and to facilitate other training activities.
 Safety
 Safety is at the core of Medpace’s mission. We have a robust incident reporting procedure for work-related injuries and illnesses and our lab operations follow all additional Health and Safety requirements. Our facilities are equipped with access control systems to maintain proper physical security for our associates and company assets, as well as on-site security personnel in key offices. In addition to physical security, we have programs and training in place for First Aid, CPR and Fire Wardens for safe evacuations. We are proud of our extremely low incident rates and remain committed to continuously monitoring campus- and policy-related measures that can be incorporated in order to further reduce risk for our associates.
Liability and Insurance
 We may be liable to our customers for any failure to conduct their clinical trials properly according to the agreed-upon protocol and contract. If we fail to conduct a clinical trial properly in accordance with the agreed-upon procedures, we may have to repeat a clinical trial or a particular portion of the services at our expense, reimburse the customer for the cost of the services and/or pay additional damages.
 At our Phase I clinic, we study the effects of drugs on healthy volunteers. In addition, in our clinical business we, on behalf of our customers, contract with physicians who render professional services, including the administration of the substance being tested to participants in clinical trials, many of whom are seriously ill and are at great risk of further illness or death as a result of factors other than their participation in a trial. As a result, we could be held liable for bodily injury, death, pain and suffering, loss of consortium or other personal injury claims and medical expenses arising from a clinical trial. In addition, we sometimes engage the services of vendors necessary for the conduct of a clinical trial, such as laboratories or medical diagnostic specialists. Because these vendors are engaged as subcontractors, we are responsible for their performance and may be held liable for damages if the subcontractors fail to perform in the manner specified in their contract.
 To reduce our potential liability, and as a requirement of the GCP regulations, informed consent is required from each volunteer and patient. In addition, our customers provide us with contractual indemnification for all of our service related contracts. These indemnities generally do not, however, protect us against certain of our own actions such as those involving negligence or misconduct. Our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed if we were required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim that is not indemnified, that is outside the scope of an indemnity or where the indemnity, although applicable, is not honored in accordance with its terms.
