--+-----------------------------------------------------------

OUR BUSINESS
 Through our accredited academic institutions, we offer a quality postsecondary education primarily online to a diverse student population, along with campus-based and blended learning programs. We pursue a student-first mindset in our efforts to provide student support throughout the academic life cycle, from enrollment and orientation through ongoing coaching and learning leading up to graduation, which we believe enhances overall student learning experiences and academic outcomes. We are committed to investing in our academic institutions and student support technology, which we believe enables our student support teams to provide customized service that contributes to positive student experiences. Technology is a key enabler and differentiator for us and we are continuing to expand the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to additional areas of the academic life cycle. We believe that our technology innovations provide students with tools that enable them to focus on educational content in a manner that is best suited to their personal learning style.
Marketing, Student Recruitment and the Student Enrollment Process
 Our universities seek motivated students with both the desire and ability to complete their academic programs of choice. To promote interest among potential students, our universities develop and engage in a variety of marketing activities which build awareness of our universities among prospective students. Our marketing programs are designed to enhance each university’s opportunity to serve a targeted section of the potential student population.
 Perdoceo serves a diverse student population. Our students have a broad range of educational and employment experiences which contributes to their college-level readiness. Each of our universities has an admissions function responsible for interacting with prospective students interested in applying to an institution after they have expressed interest in learning more about our academic institutions and programs. Generally, to be qualified for admission to one of our universities, an applicant must have received a high school diploma or a recognized equivalent, such as a General Education Development certificate. Some of our programs may also require applicants to meet other program admissions requirements.
 We use data analytics to help us identify and focus on prospective students who are more likely to succeed at one of our universities. Our prospective student outreach process uses technology to provide a more customized approach to enable us to more effectively provide prospective students with relevant information to help them make more informed academic decisions. 
 One of our technology initiatives over the last few years to expand the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning throughout the academic life cycle is AIU’s AI-based virtual assistant “chatbot” that we named Lucy. Lucy has streamlined the process for prospective students who want to learn about our institution and can address approximately 92% of their questions while continuing to learn from her interactions. If Lucy is unable to address a question, the prospective student is referred to our admissions personnel for additional assistance. Throughout 2021, we continued to expand the use of chatbots across different aspects of the academic life cycle at both CTU and AIU. 
 Our technology enhancements enable our admissions staff to customize their prospective student outreach and engagement strategies based on students’ prior educational experience, degree and areas of program interest, thus providing a more meaningful and relevant interaction with the prospective student. We believe prospective students have an improved overall experience in communications with our admissions personnel due to these enhancements.
 3

Admissions advisors serve as one of the prospective students’ primary contacts, providing information to help them make informed enrollment decisions and assisting them with the completion of the enrollment process. The admissions advisors also have a responsibility to provide guidance and support through the enrollment application process and student orientation as well as assist each student as they transition into their first class.
 Once a decision has been made to enroll at one of our academic institutions, the financial aid team works with the prospective student, providing them with information about various loans and grants available to finance their education. The focus is on getting these students financially prepared for school in a timely manner so that they can focus on their academic activities.
 Every enrolled student is offered an orientation that is designed to prepare them to begin classes at our institutions. This orientation process also provides the opportunity for students to understand our academic and support services. We believe completion of these activities better prepares a student to make an informed decision about pursuing their education as well as to be more successful as it simulates their classroom experience both online and in a campus-based environment. Completion of orientation does not financially obligate students, nor does it require students to continue their education with the university. 
 Additionally, new students who attend online programs at our universities and do not want to continue have 21 days after the start of their program to notify the university of their intention to withdraw. Students who notify and withdraw from the university within 21 days will not be responsible for any tuition-related expenses and are refunded any amounts they have paid in tuition and other institutional fees.
 Corporate Partnerships
 Our universities have focused on expanding strategic relationships with corporate partners. During 2021, CTU increased the size of its corporate partnership team during the first half of the year to further engage prospective employers to leverage their tuition assistance programs and provide a debt-free education to their employees. We expect these relationships to result in new student interest through increased awareness of our institutions for the employees of our corporate partners. Corporate partnerships provide us with an opportunity to connect with and educate a population of students we would otherwise not likely have access to. Students who attend our institutions through corporate partnerships are awarded grants from the applicable university to partially offset their tuition costs, the amount of which depends on the agreement with each respective corporate partner. In addition, they typically receive some funding from their employer towards their tuition. Although the amount paid by these students results in lower revenue per student due to the grants awarded from the applicable university, the recruiting, marketing and support costs associated with these students are lower as well. Further, these students are more likely to start class and tend to be more persistent in their pursuit of long-term learning, which we believe will result in higher life-time value per student. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 19.1% and 4.8% of total student enrollments at CTU and AIUS, respectively, are a result of corporate partnership agreements.
 Student Retention and Academic Outcomes
 Our institutions focus on improving student retention and enhancing academic outcomes. Investments in student serving processes, including the use of technology, is a key focus to support these efforts. Our faculty and student advisors provide frequent assistance and feedback to students during their course of academic study. We support increased communication between our faculty and students by providing faculty with various technology enablers such as a two-way messaging platform and enhanced data reporting and analytics to help them provide meaningful academic support and information. As is the case at any postsecondary educational institution, a portion of our students withdraw from their academic programs for a variety of academic, financial or personal reasons, and these efforts are designed to help our students remain in school and succeed in their academic program.
 Our student advising model promotes collaboration between faculty and student advisors, which we believe enhances effectiveness and provides students with consistent support and communication. Student advisors continue to work with students throughout their academic program to provide relevant and specific feedback and guidance as they progress through their classes. Additionally, a team of staff members from advising, admissions and financial aid work directly with each new student creating a student-service atmosphere and encouraging quality interactions. 
 Coupled with the student advising model, our academic institutions continually review course content, pairing and sequencing to ensure workload levels build gradually as students develop skills and acclimate to course expectations which we believe improves academic outcomes. Courses have been redesigned to accommodate skill development holistically, which we believe will support progressive learning.
 AIU’s student-centric framework focuses on having students interact with their admissions advisor from enrollment through the end of their first academic session and be subsequently supported by faculty and student advisors. We believe this structure improves overall student experiences and retention. This cross-functional strategy is aimed at improving student engagement throughout the student’s academic life cycle, with particular emphasis on the important onboarding phase and first academic term as the students adjust to their academic program. 
 Trident’s flexible learning approach provides for more time between assignment due dates, which helps students balance full-time academic progression with other priorities.

CTU leverages data analytics to provide proactive outreach and personalized advising to improve student retention and academic outcomes. This approach is intended to help us reach the right student at the right time with the right support, which we expect will increase learning and course completion by our students. We continue to refine our data analytics process to enable our student advisors to be more effective in their student engagement efforts.
 Program Development
 Our universities develop and deliver a variety of programs primarily resulting in the award of credentials ranging from certificates to doctoral degrees in career-oriented programs of study in core curricula areas of business studies, information technology and health education.
 Our curricula, instructional delivery tools, and experienced faculty comprise the learning experience that provides our student population with a unique opportunity to develop the knowledge, skills and competencies required for specific careers. The curriculum development process focuses on desired career needs, while considering relative competencies necessary to achieve these career needs, as well as any applicable recommendations set forth by advisory boards, programmatic accrediting agencies and industry standards. Subsequently, learning objectives are identified and courses are developed which foster student engagement in activities and optimally result in the attainment of program learning outcomes.
 During 2021, our institutions expanded their offerings with both the acquisition of and internal development of non-degree professional development and continuing education programs. These online courses offer learning opportunities where one can develop skills and knowledge in a specific endeavor or area of interest. Our non-degree professional development and continuing education programs are designed to assist adult learners in maintaining existing credentials and obtaining additional job-focused credentials and can help workers increase skills and prepare for changes in the workplace.
 Instructional Delivery
 Our instructional delivery for our degree programs is based on the belief that learning depends on instructional methodologies that facilitate student engagement with the instructor, with other students, and with the course content. This engagement is fundamental to student learning outcomes, regardless of whether instruction occurs within a physical or virtual classroom. We continue to focus on innovation in our delivery of online education to enhance the learning experience for students.
 During 2021, we began a multi-year project to enhance and upgrade our student technology infrastructure. This includes several upgrades to our mobile platform and virtual campus and a redesign of our digital toolsets and technology that our faculty and student support teams utilize to serve and educate students throughout their academic life cycle. These upgrades are expected to further enhance student experiences, especially for our non-traditional adult learners, while driving efficiencies within the business. 
 Learning Management System
 Construction of, and ongoing enhancement to, a virtual campus that engages online students with their instructor, peers and content is critical to the achievement of student learning outcomes. CTU and AIU’s online instructional delivery is accomplished using an innovative, student-focused learning management system. While online content delivery is very common today, our course content delivery system has several features that make it distinctive. Designed around students, our course content delivery system is a rich, engaging student experience that represents an innovative online method of delivering content.
Personalized Learning Technology
 Perdoceo has implemented the use of sophisticated personalized learning technologies through our virtual campus. Through our equity investment in and license of technology from CCKF, a Dublin-based educational technology company that provides intelligent, adaptive systems to power the delivery of personalized learning, we have strengthened our leadership position as a technology innovator in higher education and as a company dedicated to student success. Our personalized learning content was developed by teams of our own instructors and has been integrated across many of our curricula. We have a perpetual license to this technology, which, when integrated with our proprietary learning management system, we refer to as intellipath.®Intellipath serves as a powerful platform to help our students learn. It identifies and gives more time in areas where students need more help, while moving past areas they already know, thereby giving students more control of their academic progress. Students report feeling a stronger sense of confidence as they proactively address learning gaps and engage in the learning process at a deeper level. In many respects, personalized learning serves as an excellent way to facilitate and demonstrate mastery in a competency-based learning environment. Personalized learning is changing the nature of higher education by measuring real-time knowledge growth minute-by-minute and understanding of the material on a student-by-student basis.
 Our implementation of intellipath is coupled with extensive faculty training. The success of this personalized learning platform lies in the abundance of data it collects, which in turn helps our instructors determine how to structure courses, deliver material to students, predict and mitigate individual student challenges and identify teaching practices that yield the strongest results. Continuous assessment facilitates the development of individualized, dynamic learning maps that both illustrate where student mastery has been achieved and where additional work is needed. Both the student and the instructor can see in real time where learning has taken place 
 5

and where effort still needs to be applied. A major difference between our platform and others is that it focuses on student learning achievements rather than solely on student satisfaction or how fast it facilitates a student to complete assignments.
 This academic and technological breakthrough continues to advance our understanding of the learning process and supports improved student academic outcomes. We believe our intellipath personalized learning platform provides our institutions a strategic advantage by providing a more customized student experience.
 Mobile Applications
 Students at CTU and AIU have access to a mobile application and two-way messaging platform which were created to complement students’ mobile-centric lives. Approximately 95% of our students within these universities have opted in for the mobile application and to receive mobile notifications. Our students and staff are using the messenger due to its ease and simplicity. The student benefits of these technology innovations include the ability to connect with their university in a different way, communicate efficiently with faculty, upload required documentation, track grades and degree progress in real-time and participate in courses from the palm of their hand, all of which contribute to increased student engagement. CTU and AIU also have a faculty mobile application which provides informative dashboards, ability to complete tasks on the go and enhanced outreach and communication capabilities that we believe make teacher-student interactions easier and more effective. 
Faculty
 Our institutions employ approximately 2,300 credentialed, geographically dispersed, full-time and adjunct (i.e., part-time) faculty who facilitate learning in our classrooms and virtual classrooms. Our faculty are hired, assigned, developed and evaluated in accordance with current accepted higher education practices and in accordance with state, institutional accreditation and programmatic accreditation standards. Generally, our institutions require the instructor for any degree program courses to have a degree at least one level higher than the level of the course being taught (with the exception of faculty in our doctoral programs) plus teaching and/or industry experience. General education faculty members must possess at least a master’s degree. The average tenure of a Perdoceo faculty member is approximately six years. We believe the longevity of our instructors is a testament to the focus we place on student learning and the consistent quality we strive for in our classrooms.
Faculty Competencies
 With the input of faculty and academic leadership at our universities, we have developed a set of instructor competencies that we believe are critical to student success and institutional effectiveness. These competencies provide the basis for faculty recruitment, hiring, orientation, evaluation and development. Faculty hired by our academic institutions are evaluated for proficiency in the following competencies:

• | communication;
--+---------------


• | assessment of student learning;
--+--------------------------------


• | instructional methodology (pedagogy);
--+--------------------------------------


• | subject matter expertise;
--+--------------------------


• | utilization of technology to enhance teaching and learning;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | acknowledgement and accommodation of diversity in learners;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | student engagement;
--+--------------------


• | promotion of active student learning;
--+--------------------------------------


• | compliance with academic institution policy; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | demonstration of scholarship.
--+------------------------------

 Seasonality and Fluctuations in Results
 Our quarterly net revenues and income may fluctuate primarily as a result of the pattern of student enrollments. As a result, changes in the academic calendar may have an impact on quarterly comparability as each quarter may have non-comparable revenue-earning days because the academic calendar may align differently with each calendar year and the quarters therein. While operating costs for our institutions generally do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, we do traditionally increase our marketing investments during the first and third quarters in relation to the traditional back to school seasons.
 Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 4,300 employees, of which approximately 1,900 work for CTU and approximately 1,700 work for AIUS, with the remainder being corporate-level employees in areas such as marketing, information technology, financial aid, accounting, human resources, legal and compliance. Our employees include approximately 2,000 part-time adjunct faculty members and approximately 120 full-time faculty members. Other than our part-time adjunct faculty members, we have less than 60 part-time employees, some of which are student employees under the federal work study program. 
 6

At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020, we transitioned our workforce to a remote work environment. The transition to a remote work environment was supported by our scalable and innovative technology infrastructure which enabled us to make these changes with minimal disruptions to our business operations. As a result of the success of this transition, the Company made the decision during 2021 to allow its employees to continue in a hybrid work environment, which provides employees with the flexibility of working remotely or working from the corporate or campus locations when needed. This hybrid work environment gives employees and their managers the ability to determine what works best for their role in supporting students and business operations.  
 The human capital objectives that we focus on reflect the nature of our business, our regulated industry and our guiding principles and strategic priorities discussed above under the heading “Guiding Principles and Strategic Priorities.”  
 We focus on achieving results in a compliant and ethical manner. New employees in student-serving functions such as admissions and financial aid participate in multi-week training programs and our compliance monitoring programs and other ongoing compliance efforts in these and other areas are robust. The Compliance and Risk Committee of our Board of Directors regularly reviews the results of our compliance monitoring programs and matters reported through the Company’s internal system for reporting compliance concerns in order to monitor the effectiveness of these programs.
 We use technology to support students and enhance learning. Therefore, it is imperative that our employees in student-serving functions are trained to use our technology and systems for the benefit of our students. This includes our faculty members who must be proficient in using our online learning management system, personalized learning technology and mobile applications. We also focus significant human capital resources on protecting our technology infrastructure and the personal information maintained therein regarding applicants, our students, their families and our alumni. The Compliance and Risk Committee and the full Board of Directors regularly review information security matters given their importance to the Company.
 Our goal is to deploy resources in the most effective and efficient manner that we believe will lead to increased stockholder value while supporting and enhancing the academic quality of our institutions. This philosophy applies to our human capital resources as well. Significant management attention is focused on where to add human capital and other resources to grow responsibly, while at the same time monitoring human capital costs and promoting operating efficiencies. Employee turnover impacts human capital costs and operating efficiencies and as a result we have in the past seen improved operating results associated with improved tenure within student-serving functions. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors regularly reviews information about employee turnover within the Company.
 We are committed to a policy of equal employment opportunity. We value diversity and strive to create an atmosphere that supports the students and communities that we serve. Inclusivity is important in our approach to achieving a dynamic culture. We are committed to fostering an environment where differences are respected and valued and where employees feel empowered to share their experiences and ideas. The self-identified ethnicity or race of our full-time employees, including full-time faculty members, is approximately 51% White, 30% Black or African American, 11% Hispanic, Latinx or Spanish origin, 7% Asian, 0.7% American Indian or Alaskan Native and 0.3% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and our full-time employees are approximately 38% male and 62% female. The self-identified ethnicity or race of our part-time non-student employees, who are primarily part-time adjunct faculty members, is approximately 67% White, 23% Black or African American, 5% Hispanic, Latinx or Spanish origin, 4% Asian, 0.8% American Indian or Alaskan Native and less than 1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and our part-time employees are approximately 50% male and 50% female.   
 
INDUSTRY BACKGROUND AND COMPETITION
 The domestic postsecondary education industry is highly fragmented and competitive, with no one provider having a significant market share. The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended and reauthorized (“Higher Education Act”), and the related regulations govern all higher education institutions participating in federal student aid and loan programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (“Title IV Programs”). According to the National Center for Education Statistics (“NCES”), there were approximately 5,900 postsecondary education institutions eligible for federal student aid in the United States for the academic year 2020-21, including approximately 2,300 for-profit schools; approximately 1,900 public schools which include state universities and community colleges; and approximately 1,700 private non-profit schools. According to the U.S. Department of Education (“ED” or the “Department”), over the 12-month period for academic year 2019-20, approximately 26.1 million students were enrolled in postsecondary institutions.
 The domestic postsecondary degree-granting education industry was an approximately $672 billion industry for academic year 2018-19, according to a report published in 2021 by the Department. We compete in this industry primarily with other degree-granting regionally-accredited colleges and universities, both for-profit institutions like ours and public and private non-profit institutions. In particular, there is growing competition from online programs at these institutions as they increase their online offerings in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and growing prospective student interest.
 Most postsecondary institutions, regardless of how they are organized, face significant challenges, including:
  
• | a continued focus on the cost and availability of a college education;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | concerns over the high level of college student indebtedness;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 7


 
• | questions about the quality of academic programs and the ability to translate the value of a postsecondary education into economic mobility;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | competition from lower cost alternatives and from non-traditional competitors or new alternative educational paths; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the importance of preparing students with relevant skills to manage new and rapidly changing technologies and supporting employers in their efforts to optimize and advance their workforce.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Postsecondary institutions are also subject to significant regulations which provide for a regulatory triad by mandating specific regulatory responsibilities for the accrediting agencies recognized by the Department, the federal government through the Department, and state higher education regulatory bodies.
 Extensive and increasingly complex Department regulations governing postsecondary institutions have been enacted, including regulations applicable only to for-profit institutions. These regulations, coupled with the increased focus by the U.S. Congress on the role that for-profit educational institutions play in higher education, as well as the evolving needs and objectives of students and employers, economic constraints affecting educational institutions and increased focus on affordability and value, may cause increased competition across the industry as well as contribute to continued changes in business operating strategies. 
 Although competition exists, for-profit educators serve a segment of the market for postsecondary education that we believe has not been fully addressed by traditional public and private universities. Public and private non-profit institutions can face limited financial resources to expand their offerings in response to growth or changes in the demand for education, due to a combination of state funding challenges, significant expenditures required for research and the professor tenure system. Institutions may also control student enrollments to preserve the perceived prestige and exclusivity of their degree offerings. For-profit providers of postsecondary education offer prospective students the greater flexibility and convenience of their institutions' programmatic offerings and learning structure and an emphasis on applied content and the use of technology in the delivery of the education. At the same time, the share of the postsecondary education market that has been captured by for-profit providers remains relatively small. As a result, we believe that in spite of regulatory and other challenges facing the industry, for-profit postsecondary education providers continue to have significant opportunities to address the demand for postsecondary education.
 The majority of our degree-seeking students today have one or more non-traditional characteristics (e.g., did not enroll immediately after high school graduation, work full-time, are financially independent for purposes of financial aid eligibility, have dependents other than a spouse or are single parents). These non-traditional students typically are looking to improve their skills and enhance their earning potential within the context of their careers or in pursuit of new careers. As the industry has shifted to more students with non-traditional characteristics, an increasing proportion of colleges and universities are addressing the needs of working students. This includes colleges and universities with well-established brand names that were historically focused on traditional students.
 ACCREDITATION, STATE REGULATION AND OTHER COMPLIANCE MATTERS
 Institutional Accreditation
 In the United States, accreditation is a process through which an institution subjects itself to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions. Accrediting agencies primarily examine the academic quality of the instructional programs of an institution, and a grant of accreditation is generally viewed as confirmation that an institution’s programs meet generally accepted academic standards. Accrediting agencies also review the administrative and financial operations of the institutions they accredit to ensure that each institution has the resources to meet its educational mission.
 Pursuant to provisions of the Higher Education Act, the Department relies on accrediting agencies to determine whether institutions’ educational programs qualify the institutions to participate in Title IV Programs. The Higher Education Act and its implementing regulations specify certain standards that all recognized accrediting agencies must adopt in connection with their review of postsecondary institutions.
 Both CTU and AIUS are accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (“HLC”) (www.hlcommission.org), an institutional accrediting agency that is recognized by the Department. CTU’s next re-affirmation of accreditation is scheduled for 2023. CTU had a comprehensive evaluation in 2017, during which HLC found that CTU continued to meet HLC’s criteria for accreditation, while requesting that CTU complete some interim reporting prior to its next re-affirmation of accreditation review. CTU has submitted all requested interim reports. AIUS’ next re-affirmation of accreditation is scheduled for 2024. AIUS had a comprehensive evaluation in 2018, during which HLC found that AIUS continued to meet HLC’s criteria for accreditation.
 Programmatic Accreditation 
 In addition to the institutional accreditation described above, CTU and AIUS have specialized programmatic accreditation for particular educational programs. Many states and professional associations require professional programs to be accredited at a program level, and require individuals who must sit for professional license exams to have graduated from accredited programs. Programmatic accreditation does not satisfy the Department requirements to confer Title IV Program eligibility; however, it does provide additional academic quality review by peers in a given field and may enable or assist graduates to practice, sit for licensing or 
 8

certification exams (in some cases) or otherwise secure appropriate employment in their chosen field. In addition to programmatic accreditation, some states have licensing boards which regulate who in a state is licensed to practice in a given profession.
 Our universities pursue programmatic accreditation if that accreditation is required by employers or licensing bodies in order for a graduate to practice the profession or if it is required in order for a graduate to sit for a licensing or certification exam in order to practice or advance in the profession. In most cases, programmatic accreditation is sought because it is desired by employers and may enhance the ability of our graduates to compete for employment in their field.
 Programmatic accreditation has been granted by the following accrediting agencies for the following degree program areas offered by our institutions.

State Regulation
 State approval agencies are responsible for the oversight of educational institutions, and continued approval by such agencies is necessary for an institution to operate and grant degrees or certificates to its students. State laws establish standards for, among other things, student instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities, and financial policies. State laws and regulations may limit our campuses’ ability to operate or to award degrees or certificates or offer new programs. Moreover, under the Higher Education Act and Department regulations, approval by such agencies is necessary to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs. Currently, each of our ground-based campuses is authorized by the state in which it is located. Additionally, our online institutions have separate state approval or recognition from the relevant state agency via participation in a consortia program called the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (“SARA”) in the states in which they enroll and/or recruit students. California is the only state which is not a part of SARA; however, CTU and AIUS hold the appropriate approval in that state.
 SARA is an agreement among member states, districts and U.S. territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education courses and programs. States, districts and territories apply to become members of SARA (which, in many cases, requires action by state legislators) and if accepted, institutions approved in their “home” state may apply to become participants in the SARA compact and the “home” state authorization is deemed acceptable to operate an online program in other states that also participate in SARA as long as they do not establish a “physical presence” in those other states (as defined by SARA). Forty-nine states plus the District of Columbia are SARA participants (www.nc-sara.org). CTU and AIUS are approved to participate in SARA by their home states (Colorado and Arizona, respectively). 
 In addition to state education regulations, there are other state agencies that oversee regulations related to student financing, payment servicing and general consumer protection. In some cases, state laws and regulations require us to register the volume of payment plans our students enter into and/or require licenses for our institutions to collect student payments for the educational services they deliver.
 Other Compliance Matters
 In recent years, states and federal agencies have increased their focus on the for-profit, postsecondary education sector. This includes increased activity by state attorneys general and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) in their review of the sector. 
 9

In this regard, on January 3, 2019, the Company entered into agreements with attorneys general from 48 states and the District of Columbia to bring closure to multi-state inquiries ongoing since January 2014. As part of the agreements, the Company expressly denied any allegations of wrongdoing but agreed to, among other things, work with a third-party administrator that will report annually for three years on the Company’s compliance with various obligations the Company committed to in the agreements. Operationally, the Company committed to:
  
• | provide students with additional communication of important policies, academic program information and financial aid information during the enrollment process, including a single page program disclosure as well as disclosure of applicable refund policies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide newly enrolling students an online financial aid interactive tool that can assist them in understanding their financial commitments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue its existing practice of offering a no cost orientation and/or an introductory course with materials designed to support new college students (if they have less than 24 college credits); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | permit undergraduate students to withdraw with no monetary obligation up to seven days after their first class at on-campus schools and up to 21 days after the start of the term at online programs (if they have less than 24 online college credits).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 From a compliance standpoint, the Company committed to:
  
• | continue many of its existing compliance programs that it uses to monitor for accurate communication with prospective students;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue its monitoring of third-party marketing vendors and agreed on a process to continue to hold them accountable for complying with the Company’s advertising guidelines;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue to monitor and review conversations that its admissions and financial aid staff have with prospective students during the student recruitment process; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhance current training to staff working with students regarding the additional information and tools that are part of the commitments in the agreements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Generally, the operational aspects we agreed to as part of the agreements with the attorneys general are for a six-year period. With respect to working with a third-party administrator, the Company voluntarily agreed to extend the engagement for an additional year beyond the initial three year period to enable the administrator to continue its review of the Company’s compliance program enhancements adopted over the initial period. Further, on July 26, 2019, the Company executed a settlement agreement with the FTC to resolve an inquiry commenced by the FTC in 2015. While not admitting any wrongdoing, the Company chose to settle the FTC inquiry after almost four years of legal expenses and cooperating with the FTC’s investigation. Under the terms of the agreement with the FTC, the Company agreed to continue its compliance with the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, including compliance with the national do not call registry. The Company agreed to enhance its current operational and compliance processes with respect to prospective student expressions of interest, or “leads,” purchased from third party lead aggregators and generators and implement other agreed-upon compliance measures. Specifically, the agreement with the FTC requires the operation of a system to monitor third party lead aggregators and generators involving a compliance review by, or on behalf of, the Company of the various sources a prospective student interacts with prior to the Company’s purchase and use of the prospective student lead. In addition, the FTC Agreement contains requirements regarding employee and lead aggregator acknowledgements of the agreement, compliance certifications and record creation and maintenance. The principal provisions of the agreement with the FTC will remain in effect for twenty years. 
 These agreements and an earlier agreement with the New York Attorney General have led to periodic requests for information to demonstrate continued compliance with the agreements and applicable regulations. Compiling data and other information in response to these and other requests from various state and federal agencies is costly and time consuming and any resulting claim of noncompliance may harm our reputation and business.  
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – Our agreements with multiple state attorneys general and the FTC may lead to unexpected impacts on our student enrollments or higher than anticipated expenses, a failure to comply may lead to additional enforcement actions and continued scrutiny may result in additional costs or new enforcement actions,” for more information about these agreements.
 STUDENT FINANCIAL AID AND RELATED FEDERAL REGULATION
 A majority of our students require assistance in financing their education. Our institutions are approved to participate in the U.S. Department of Education’s Title IV federal aid programs. Our institutions also participate in a number of state financial aid programs, tuition assistance programs of the United States Armed Forces and education benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”). Our institutions that participate in federal and state financial aid programs are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulatory requirements imposed by federal and state government agencies, and other standards imposed by educational accrediting bodies.
 10

Nature of Federal Support for Postsecondary Education in the United States
 The U.S. government provides a substantial portion of its support for postsecondary education in the form of Title IV Program grants, loans and work-study programs to students who can use those funds to finance certain education related expenses at any institution that has been approved to participate by the Department. These federal programs are authorized by the Higher Education Act. While most students are eligible for a Title IV loan, typically, financial aid administered under Title IV is awarded on the basis of financial need, which is generally defined under the Higher Education Act as the difference between the costs associated with attending an institution and the amount a student’s family can reasonably be expected to contribute based on a federally determined formula. Among other things, recipients of Title IV Program funds must maintain a satisfactory grade point average and progress in a timely manner toward completion of their program of study.
 Students at our institutions may receive grants, loans and work-study opportunities to fund their education under the Title IV Programs described in the sections below. In addition, some students at our institutions receive education related benefits pursuant to certain programs for veterans and military personnel, the most significant of which are described further below.
 Federal Student and Parent Loans
 The Department’s major form of aid includes loans to students and parents through the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (“Direct Loan”) Program. Direct Loans are loans made directly by the U.S. Government to students or their parents. The Direct Loan program offers Federal Direct Stafford, Federal Direct PLUS (which provides loans to parents of dependent students and to graduate or professional students, known as Parent PLUS and Grad PLUS) and Federal Direct Consolidation Loans. 
 Undergraduate students who have demonstrated financial need may be eligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan, with the Department paying the interest on this loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time in school. Graduate and undergraduate students who do not demonstrate financial need may be eligible to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Graduate/professional students may only receive Direct Unsubsidized Loans. With Direct Unsubsidized Loans the student is responsible for the interest while in school and after leaving school, although actual interest payments generally may be deferred by the student until after he or she has left school. Students who are eligible for a Direct Subsidized Loan may also be eligible to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan.
 A student is not required to meet any specific credit scoring criteria to receive a Direct Loan, but any student with a default on a prior loan made under any Title IV Program may not be eligible. The Department has established maximum annual and aggregate borrowing limits for Direct Loans.
 The Direct PLUS Loan Program provides loans to either the parents of dependent students or to graduate students. Parents and graduate students who have an acceptable credit history may borrow a Direct PLUS Loan to pay the education related expenses of a child who is a dependent or a graduate student enrolled at least half-time at our eligible institutions. The amount of a Direct PLUS Loan cannot exceed the student’s cost of attendance less all other financial aid received. 
 Federal Pell Grant and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant 
 Title IV Program grants are generally made to our students under the Federal Pell Grant (“Pell Grant”) program and the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (“FSEOG”) program. The 2021-22 maximum annual Pell Grant is $6,495, excluding any additional amount awarded pursuant to a year-round Pell Grant. Beginning with the 2017-18 award year, eligible students may receive year-round Pell Grant funds. A year-round Pell Grant program allows students to receive up to 150% of the student’s regular award, allowing students to maintain their enrollment status and receive Pell Grant funds for up to two additional academic terms during an award year so that they can continue taking classes and work toward graduating more quickly. To be eligible for the additional Pell Grant funds, the student must be enrolled at least half-time in the payment period(s) for which the student receives the additional Pell Grant funds in excess of 100% of the student’s regular Pell Grant award.
 The FSEOG program awards are designed to supplement Pell Grants up to a maximum amount of $4,000 per academic year for the neediest students. Our institutions are required to provide matching funding for FSEOG awards that represent not less than 25% of the total FSEOG award to be received by eligible students. The matching may be accomplished through institutional, private and/or state funds.
 Federal Work-Study Program
 Generally, under the federal work-study program, federal funds are used to pay 75% of the cost of part-time employment of eligible students to perform work for the institution or certain off-campus organizations. The remaining 25% is paid by the institution or the student’s employer. In select cases, these federal funds under the federal work-study program are used to pay up to 100% of the cost of part-time employment of eligible students.
Veterans Benefits Programs
 Some of our students who are veterans use their benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill or the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, as amended (“Post-9/11 GI Bill”), to cover their tuition. A certain number of our students are also eligible to receive funds from other education assistance programs administered by the VA.
 11

The Yellow Ribbon program under the Post-9/11 GI Bill expanded education benefits for veterans who have served on active duty on or after September 11, 2001, including reservists and members of the National Guard. As originally passed, the Post-9/11 GI Bill provided that eligible veterans could receive benefits for tuition purposes up to the cost of in-state tuition at the most expensive public institution of higher education in the state where the veteran was enrolled. In addition, veterans who were enrolled in classroom-based programs or “blended programs” (programs that combine classroom learning and distance learning) could receive monthly housing stipends, while veterans enrolled in wholly distance-based programs were not entitled to a monthly housing stipend. The provisions regarding education benefits for post-9/11 veterans took effect August 1, 2009. The Post-9/11 GI Bill also increased the amount of education benefits available to eligible veterans under the pre-existing Montgomery GI Bill. The legislation also authorized expansion of service members’ ability to transfer veterans’ education benefits to family members.
 On January 4, 2011, the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010 (“Improvements Act”) was adopted, which amends the Post-9/11 GI Bill in several respects. The Improvements Act alters the way benefits related to tuition and fees are calculated. For nonpublic U.S. institutions, the Improvements Act bases the benefits related to tuition and fees on the net cost to the student (after accounting for state and federal aid, scholarships, institutional aid, fee waivers, and similar assistance paid directly to the institution for the sole purpose of defraying tuition cost) rather than the charges established by the institution. The Improvements Act also replaced the state-dependent benefit cap with a single national cap which is adjusted annually and as of August 1, 2021 is $26,042. In addition, veterans pursuing a program of education solely through distance learning on a more than half-time basis are eligible to receive up to 50% of the national average of the basic housing allowance available to service members who are at military pay grade E-5 and have dependents. Most “Improvements Act” changes took effect on August 1 or October 1, 2011, though changes to rules regarding eligibility for benefits were effective immediately or retroactively to the effective date of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The Improvements Act did not change the Post-9/11 GI Bill’s provision that allows veterans to receive up to $1,000 per academic year for books, supplies, equipment and other education costs.
U.S. Military Tuition Assistance
 Service members of the United States Armed Forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of service through the Uniform Tuition Assistance Program of the Department of Defense (“DoD”). Service members may use this tuition assistance to pursue postsecondary degrees at postsecondary institutions that are accredited by accrediting agencies that are recognized by the Department. Each branch of the armed forces has established its own rules for the tuition assistance programs of DoD.
 In 2010, both the U.S. Congress and DoD increased their focus on DoD tuition assistance that is used for distance education and programs at for-profit institutions. The DoD Voluntary Education Partnership Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) was established as part of the revised DoD Instruction 1322.25, Voluntary Education Programs dated March 15, 2011. The DoD updated the MOU in 2014 and 2019, in each case with enhanced requirements for institutions. The MOU requires that participating institutions provide meaningful information to students about the financial cost and attendance at an institution so military students can make informed decisions on where to attend school, will not use unfair, deceptive, and abusive recruiting practices and will provide academic and student support services to service members and their families. It contains requirements regarding the disclosures of costs and amounts covered by federal educational benefits, marketing standards, state authorization, accreditation approvals, standard institutional refund policies, educational plans and academic and financial advising. The MOU also incorporates the development and implementation of the “VA Shopping Sheet,” a standardized cost form with federal aid information which has evolved into what is now referred to by ED as the “College Financing Plan”. The MOU conveys the commitments and agreements between the educational institution and DoD prior to accepting funds under the tuition assistance program. For example, the MOU requires an institution to agree to support DoD regulatory guidance, adhere to a bill of rights that is specified in the regulations, and participate in the proposed Military Voluntary Education Review program. Under the MOU, institutions must also agree to adhere to the principles and criteria established by the Service Members Opportunity Colleges Degree Network System regarding the transferability of credit and the awarding of credit for military training and experience. Both CTU and AIUS have signed each of the DoD’s standard MOUs, including the most recent in August 2019 which is effective through 2024.
Institutional Payment Plans 

 Some of our students will enter into institutional payment plans with our institutions to pay a portion, or occasionally all, of their institutional charges directly to the school. This may occur for students who have a gap between Title IV financial aid funding and other third party aid available to them and the institutional charges or for students who are enrolled in programs or courses for which Title IV or other financial aid is not offered. We offer these payment plans over the in-school period, and up to 12 months beyond graduation. The payment plans do not charge interest. 
 Eligibility and Certification by the Department
 Under the provisions of the Higher Education Act, an institution must apply to the Department for continued certification to participate in Title IV Programs at least every six years or when it undergoes a change of control. In addition, an institution must obtain the Department approval for certain substantial changes in its operations, including changes in an institution’s accrediting agency or state authorizing agency or changes to an institution’s structure or certain basic educational features.
 12

Institutions approved to participate in Title IV Programs sign a program participation agreement provided by the Department that describes the terms of participation and includes a number of certifications and assurances made by the head of the institutions. As long as an institution has submitted an application for re-certification prior to the expiration of its current program participation agreement, the institution’s eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs continues on a month-to-month basis until the Department completes its review. The Department may issue full certification to an institution, it may deny certification or it may elect to issue provisional certification, in which case the program participation agreement outlines additional requirements that the institution must meet. 
 The Department may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all required eligibility and certification standards. During the period of provisional certification, an institution must obtain prior Department approval to add an educational program, open a new location or make any other significant change. Provisional certification does not generally limit an institution’s access to Title IV Program funds. The Department may withdraw an institution’s provisional certification without advance notice if the Department determines that the institution is not fulfilling all material requirements.
 In May 2019, both CTU and AIUS (then known as AIU) received renewals of their program participation agreements through March 31, 2021. CTU was removed from provisional certification, while AIUS remains on provisional certification due to open regulatory review processes with the Department at the time of the renewal. Following the Trident acquisition and AIU’s implementation of a university system model, institutional accreditation and approval by the Department continues at the system level.
 CTU and AIUS each submitted its application for recertification to continue participation in Title IV Programs on December 21, 2020 and await completion of the Department’s review.  
 In connection with its administration of Title IV Programs, the Department has broad powers to request information and review records of a participating institution. The Company is in the process of responding to an extensive request for information received from the Department in December 2021 relating to CTU and AIUS. Significant resources are required to respond to this request and the Department’s review of the information provided could lead to additional requests for information or claims of noncompliance with the extensive regulatory requirements relating to the administration of Title IV Programs.
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – Compliance with the extensive regulatory requirements applicable to our business can be costly and time consuming, and failure to comply could result in financial penalties, restrictions on our operations, loss of federal and state financial aid funding for our students, or loss of our authorization to operate our institutions” and “– If the Department denies, or significantly conditions, recertification of either of our institutions to participate in Title IV Programs, that institution could not conduct its business as it is currently conducted,” and other risk factors in Item 1A for additional information about the risks surrounding continued participation in Title IV Programs.
 Scrutiny of the For-Profit Postsecondary Education Sector
 In recent years, Congress, the Department, states, accrediting agencies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), the FTC, state attorneys general and the media have scrutinized the for-profit postsecondary education sector. Congressional hearings and roundtable discussions were held regarding various aspects of the education industry, including issues surrounding student debt as well as publicly reported student outcomes that may be used as part of an institution’s recruiting and admissions practices, and reports were issued that are highly critical of for-profit colleges and universities. A group of influential U.S. senators, consumer advocacy groups and some media outlets have strongly and repeatedly encouraged the Department, DoD and the VA and its state approving agencies to take action to limit or terminate the participation of institutions such as ours in existing tuition assistance programs. In addition, targeted loan relief to student borrowers is a stated priority for the Department, and consumer advocacy groups and others are focusing their lobbying and other efforts relating to student debt forgiveness on for-profit colleges and universities, encouraging loan discharge applications and complaints by former students. 
 The current Presidential and Department administrations, as well as Congress, are pursuing significant legislative, regulatory and administrative actions that will affect our business. For example, as discussed below, new legislation changing the 90-10 Rule passed in 2021, and numerous existing or former regulations are being modified or reproposed for future adoption by the Department. Any actions that limit our participation in Title IV Programs or the amount of student financial aid for which our students are eligible would materially impact our student enrollments and profitability and could impact the continued viability of our business as currently conducted. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate.”
 Legislative Action and Recent Department Regulatory Initiatives
 The U.S. Congress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and other laws governing Title IV Programs and annually determines the funding level for each Title IV Program.
 The Higher Education Opportunity Act (“HEOA”) was the most recent reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and was signed into law on August 14, 2008. It was immediately effective for many items with others effective in subsequent years. The HEOA authorized increases in the Federal Pell Grants, changed certain grant eligibility requirements, expanded Stafford Loan 
 13

deferment options, provided changes to needs analysis, changed treatment of Veterans Administration benefits effective with the 2010-11 award year and revised many of the regulations governing an institution’s eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.
 Historically, Congress reauthorized the Higher Education Act every five to six years. However, the last full reauthorization took place in 2008 and Congress has subsequently taken several actions that effectively extend the Higher Education Act and various Title IV Programs on a temporary basis. Congress could work to reauthorize the Higher Education Act in its entirety, pass a series of smaller bills that focus on individual parts of the Higher Education Act, primarily Title IV Programs, or continue to extend existing Title IV Programs for more limited terms while continuing debate on broader policy objectives. Additionally, legislative changes impacting Title IV Programs is included in broader legislation from time to time. For example, certain legislation has been passed that is focused on simplifying both access to and repayment of Title IV funds, which should be of benefit to students. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed a multi-faceted legislative package that includes new economic stimulus measures broadly targeting various aspects of the U.S. economy. Congress included in this legislation a modification to the “90-10 Rule” applicable to for-profit institutions that alters the measurement under the rule from the percentage of Title IV Program tuition revenue an institution receives to the percentage of “federal educational assistance” an institution receives. While the required ratio to maintain Title IV Program eligibility will remain at below 90%, specific details on the modified rule and what constitutes “federal educational assistance” are expected to be determined pursuant to negotiated rulemaking (see “Negotiated Rulemaking 2022: Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility” below). The legislation specifies that the earliest the modified rule may apply is for institutional fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, and effectiveness for 2023 generally requires that final regulations be published prior to November 1, 2022. See the “Compliance with Federal Regulatory Standards and Effect of Federal Regulatory Violations” section below for information about the 90-10 Rule and Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – Our institutions could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs or have other limitations placed upon them if the percentage of their revenues derived from those programs is too high,” for information regarding risks relating to the 90-10 Rule and this pending rulemaking.
 Scrutiny of the for-profit postsecondary education sector and the ongoing policy differences in Congress regarding spending levels could lead to significant regulatory changes in connection with the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, and many of these changes may be adverse to postsecondary institutions generally or for-profit institutions specifically. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – The extensive regulatory requirements applicable to our business may change, in particular as a result of the scrutiny of the for-profit postsecondary education sector and the results of the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections, which could require us to make substantial changes to our business, reduce our profitability and make compliance more difficult.”
 The Department regularly engages in significant rulemaking efforts intended to develop new regulations focused on various topics. Recent rulemaking initiatives focused on state authorization, distance learning, accreditation, educational innovation and other matters. In addition to Department initiatives, recent federal legislation was passed which is designed to help streamline the financial aid application process for students and to provide assistance to students as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 Two additional regulatory initiatives by the Department of significance have occurred in recent years. First is the adoption of new “borrower defense to repayment” regulations in 2019. See the “Compliance with Federal Regulatory Standards and Effect of Federal Regulatory Violations” section below for a description of these regulations. Further changes to the borrower defense to repayment regulations are being considered (see “Negotiated Rulemaking 2021: Affordability and Student Loans” below). 
 Second, the Department’s rulemaking efforts in 2019 resulted in the rescission of previously adopted “gainful employment” regulations. Perdoceo’s institutions, and most other for-profit institutions, qualify for Title IV Program participation on the basis that they offer programs that, in addition to meeting other requirements, “prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation.” During 2013, the Department established negotiated rulemaking committees, one specifically designed to limit Title IV availability for programs at for-profit institutions by defining gainful employment in a recognized occupation. On October 30, 2014, the Department published a new complex final regulation, effective July 1, 2015, to define “gainful employment” as meeting certain standards measuring the general amount students borrow for enrollment in a program against an amount of their reported earnings. Prior to this rulemaking, the term gainful employment had been used in the Higher Education Act for forty years, and had not been further defined by Congress or the Department. Through negotiated rulemaking sessions, the Department considered different options for adopting a uniform set of requirements that could be applicable to all schools and not specifically targeted at for-profit institutions. After a public comment period on its proposal, the Department published a final regulation on July 1, 2019 to rescind the 2015 gainful employment regulation effective on July 1, 2020. In lieu of the complex gainful employment regulation designed to eliminate program eligibility, the Department continued to update the college scorecards it developed, which apply to all Title IV eligible institutions, with relevant information for prospective students. While the eligibility tests and disclosures associated with the 2015 gainful employment regulation are no longer required, the term “gainful employment” continues to exist in the Higher Education Act and CTU’s and AIUS’ Title IV eligible programs will continue to need to be career focused educational programs. The Department has begun the process of re-adopting a new version of this regulation as part of its 2022 negotiated rulemaking covering institutional and programmatic eligibility (see “Negotiated Rulemaking 2022: Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility” below). Initial discussions as part of the negotiated rulemakings have considered adoption of program eligibility rules that, like the 2015 gainful employment regulation, would measure student debt at a program level against a measure of earnings. However, these discussions have also 
 14

included various potential adjustments that may cause programs that passed the eligibility test under the 2015 gainful employment regulation to lose Title IV Program eligibility under the new regulation. We are closely monitoring the negotiated rulemaking process but are unable to determine the potential impact of any final regulations on our business at this time. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – The extensive regulatory requirements applicable to our business may change, in particular as a result of the scrutiny of the for-profit postsecondary education sector and the results of the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections, which could require us to make substantial changes to our business, reduce our profitability and make compliance more difficult,” for information about the potential impact of new regulations on our business.
 Negotiated Rulemaking 2021: Affordability and Student Loans 
 In December 2021, the Department concluded negotiated rulemaking on a number of topics related to affordability and student loans. Pursuant to the negotiated rulemaking process, the Department, through a series of three, weeklong meetings in each of October, November and December, worked to develop a notice of proposed rulemaking with representatives of the parties who would be affected significantly by the regulations. If a rulemaking committee is able to reach a consensus on its area, then the agreed upon proposal is submitted for public comment as the proposed regulation, and the final regulation typically aligns closely with the agreed upon proposal. During this rulemaking process, the Department sought the committee’s consensus on an issue-by-issue basis, rather than for all the topics included for the committee’s consideration as a whole. The collection of topics discussed during these negotiations generally relate to different Title IV regulations that impact a student’s ability to reduce or avoid repaying their student loans. During the process, the Department expressed a goal of making it easier for students to have their loans discharged or forgiven and providing more favorable loan repayment terms. The Department also intends to make it easier to seek recovery of discharged loan funds from institutions through modifications to existing adjudication processes and standards of proof. These goals were shared by many of the committee participants.
 Negotiators reached consensus on four of 12 topics that were open for discussion: 
  
• | Discharges for borrowers with a total and permanent disability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Eliminating certain interest capitalization events that increase loan costs for students;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Discharges for when a school falsely certifies a student was eligible for Title IV Program financial aid; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pell Grant eligibility for prison education programs.
--+------------------------------------------------------

 Negotiators failed to come to agreement on the remaining topics:
  
• | Closed school discharge;
--+-------------------------


• | Expanding and simplifying public service loan forgiveness;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Modifying the borrower defense to repayment processes for students;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Modifying the process of recovering funds from schools for loans discharged pursuant to the borrower defense to repayment process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Restricting schools from adopting pre-dispute arbitration requirements and waivers of class action lawsuits; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes to the income driven loan repayment policies.
--+------------------------------------------------------

 With negotiations completed, the next step in the rulemaking process is for the Department to draft and publish proposed regulations on these topics for public comment. On the four areas where negotiators reached consensus, the Department is obligated to use the consensus language in the regulatory text it publishes for comment. On the areas where consensus was not reached, the Department is free to draft language as it sees fit. The proposed rules may reduce the obligations on students applying for loan discharge and increase the burdens on institutions that provide documentation regarding student claims. After the public notice and comment period, if final regulations are published prior to November 1, 2022, the regulations would generally become effective July 1, 2023. We are closely monitoring the negotiated rulemaking process but are unable to determine the potential impact of any final regulations on our business at this time. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – The extensive regulatory requirements applicable to our business may change, in particular as a result of the scrutiny of the for-profit postsecondary education sector and the results of the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections, which could require us to make substantial changes to our business, reduce our profitability and make compliance more difficult,” for information about the potential impact of new regulations on our business.  
 Negotiated Rulemaking 2022: Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility
 On October 4, 2021, the Department announced its intent to establish another negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations related to institutional and programmatic eligibility. Negotiating sessions of the institutional and programmatic eligibility negotiated rulemaking committee were held in January and February 2022, with a third session scheduled in March 2022. As part of the negotiating sessions, the Department provided issue papers that revealed its intent to impose a number of additional obligations for schools and programs to remain eligible for Title IV funds. The following topics are included as part of this negotiated rulemaking process:

• | Adopting new regulations to calculate the ratio of a for-profit school’s revenue that is federal education assistance referred to as “90-10”;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 15

 
• | Adopting a program eligibility rule tied to the term “gainful employment”;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establishing Title IV eligibility through an alternative process known as "ability to benefit”;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Imposing new requirements on owners and operators that sign agreements with the Department to participate in Title IV Programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Placing additional requirements and limits on changes of ownership or control;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adopting new events that can lead to the posting of letters of credit or other commitments as part of the Department’s financial responsibility standards; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Department is proposing to add a number of requirements as obligations schools must satisfy in order to be considered administratively capable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In each of the topics currently being negotiated, the Department is proposing rules that impose additional burdens on schools, and often the proposals being discussed apply to schools unevenly. For example, the “90-10” Rule is an additional annual eligibility test requirement that applies exclusively to for-profit sector schools, but only one negotiator represents the for-profit sector. The gainful employment rule is designed to primarily impose additional requirements on for-profit sector programs and many of the proposed modifications to other long standing existing rules contain new requirements that relate exclusively to for-profit sector schools and their ownership structures. In the case of the “90-10” Rule, the Department provided limited information on how it intends to define “federal educational assistance” and instead proposed a number of changes designed to reduce the amount of favorable tuition revenue a school could include to pass. In the case of gainful employment, the Department is proposing a number of modifications that make the test more difficult to pass and eliminate opportunities for programs to make improvements.
 The previously adopted and rescinded gainful employment regulation is discussed above in this “Legislative Action and Recent Department Regulatory Initiatives” section, and please see the “Compliance with Federal Regulatory Standards and Effect of Federal Regulatory Violations” section below for an overview of the current rules relating to “90-10,” change of ownership or control, financial responsibility and administrative capability.
 Following the completion of the negotiation sessions, the Department intends to publish its proposed regulations for public comment. Publication of final regulations in the Federal Register must occur on or before November 1 for the regulations to be effective for the next federal student financial aid award year, which begins July 1 of the following year. Negotiated rulemaking committees convened in recent years generally have not reached consensus, resulting in the Department having significant latitude in formulating regulations. We are closely monitoring the negotiated rulemaking process but are unable to determine the potential impact of any final regulations on our business at this time. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – The extensive regulatory requirements applicable to our business may change, in particular as a result of the scrutiny of the for-profit postsecondary education sector and the results of the 2020 Presidential and Congressional elections, which could require us to make substantial changes to our business, reduce our profitability and make compliance more difficult,” for information about the potential impact of new regulations on our business.
 Compliance with Federal Regulatory Standards and Effect of Federal Regulatory Violations
 To be eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, an institution must comply with the Higher Education Act and regulations thereunder that are administered by the Department. We and our institutions are regularly subject to audits and compliance reviews and periodically subject to inquiries, lawsuits, investigations, and/or claims of non-compliance from federal and state regulatory agencies, accrediting agencies, the Department, present and former students and employees, and others that may allege violations of statutes, regulations, accreditation standards or other regulatory requirements applicable to us or our institutions. If the results of any such audits, reviews, investigations, claims or actions are unfavorable to us, we may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines, operational limitations, loss of federal funding, injunctions, additional oversight and reporting, provisional certification or other civil or criminal penalties. In addition, if the Department or another regulatory agency determined that one of our institutions improperly disbursed Title IV Program funds or violated a provision of the Higher Education Act or the Department’s regulations, that institution could be required to repay such funds, and could be assessed an administrative fine. 
 The Higher Education Act also requires that an institution’s administration of Title IV Program funds be audited annually by an independent accounting firm and that the resulting audit report be submitted to the Department for review. In September 2016, the Department’s Office of Inspector General released a revised audit guide applicable specifically to proprietary schools and third-party servicers administering Title IV programs. The updated guide is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2016. The revised audit guide was effective for us for the year ending December 31, 2017 and applies to annual compliance audits due June 30, 2018 and thereafter. The new guide significantly increases the requirements and testing procedures necessary when filing our annual Title IV compliance audits.
  “90-10 Rule”
 Under a provision of the Higher Education Act commonly referred to as the “90-10 Rule,” any of our institutions that, on modified cash basis accounting, derives more than 90% of its cash receipts from Title IV sources for a fiscal year will be placed on provisional participation status for its next two fiscal years. If an institution does not satisfy the 90-10 Rule for two consecutive fiscal 
 16

years, it will lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs for at least two fiscal years. We have substantially no control over the amount of Title IV student loans and grants sought by or awarded to our students. If an institution violates the 90-10 Rule and becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs but continues to disburse Title IV Program funds, the Department could require repayment of all Title IV Program funds received by it after the effective date of the loss of eligibility.
 We have implemented various measures intended to reduce the percentage of our institution’s cash basis revenue attributable to Title IV Program funds, including emphasizing employer-paid and other direct-pay education programs such as our corporate partnerships, diversifying our educational offerings to increase the portion of our students who do not rely on Title IV Programs, recruitment of international students, the use of externally funded scholarships and grants and counseling students to carefully evaluate the amount of necessary Title IV Program borrowing. 
 Our preliminary calculation of the 90-10 rates for our institutions for the year ended December 31, 2021 is approximately 84% for CTU and approximately 86% for AIUS, which are in compliance with the 90-10 Rule. However, as discussed above in “Legislative Action and Recent Department Regulatory Initiatives,” the 90-10 Rule is currently subject to revision as part of a negotiated rulemaking process and we expect the calculation under the existing rule to be replaced with a new calculation that alters the measurement under the rule from the percentage of Title IV Program tuition revenue an institution receives to the percentage of “federal educational assistance” an institution receives, with what constitutes “federal educational assistance” to be defined in regulations to be adopted following the negotiated rulemaking process. We expect “federal educational assistance” under the revised rule to be defined more broadly than Title IV Program tuition revenue an institution receives as under the existing rule, making compliance with the revised rule more difficult. For example, government education assistance for military or veteran personnel is likely to be considered “federal educational assistance” under the revised rule. 
 The ability of our institutions to maintain 90-10 rates below 90% will depend on the impact of future changes in our student enrollment mix, and regulatory and other factors outside of our control, including any changes in government education assistance for military or veteran personnel, and changes in the treatment of such funding for purposes of the 90-10 rate calculation. In addition, changes in, or new interpretations of, the technical aspects of the calculation methodology or other industry practices under the 90-10 Rule could further significantly impact our compliance with the 90-10 Rule. 
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – Our institutions could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs or have other limitations placed upon them if the percentage of their revenues derived from those programs is too high,” for additional information regarding risks relating to the 90-10 Rule.
 Student Loan Default Rates
 An institution may lose eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV Programs if the rates at which its former students default on the repayment of their federally-guaranteed or federally-funded student loans exceed specified percentages. This is determined by an institution’s cohort default rate which is calculated on an annual basis as a measure of administrative capability. Each cohort is the group of students who first enter into student loan repayment during a federal fiscal year (ending September 30). An institution’s cohort default rate is calculated as the percentage of borrowers who entered repayment in the relevant federal fiscal year who default before the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the borrowers entered repayment. This represents a three-year measurement period.
 If an institution’s three-year cohort default rate exceeds 10% for any one of the three preceding years, it must delay for 30 days the release of the first disbursement of U.S. federal student loan proceeds to first time borrowers enrolled in the first year of an undergraduate program. As a matter of regular practice, our institutions have implemented a 30-day delay for such disbursements.
 If an institution’s three-year cohort default rate exceeds 30% for any given year, it must establish a default prevention task force and develop a default prevention plan with measurable objectives for improving the cohort default rate.
 Excessive three-year cohort default rates will result in the loss of an institution’s Title IV eligibility, as follows:
  
• | Annual test. If the three-year cohort default rate for any given year exceeds 40%, the institution will cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV Programs; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Three consecutive years test. If the institution’s three-year cohort default rate exceeds 30% for three consecutive years, the institution will cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV Programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have initiatives aimed at reducing the likelihood of our students’ failure to repay their loans in a timely manner. These initiatives emphasize the importance of students’ compliance with loan repayment requirements and provide for loan counseling and communication with students after they cease enrollment. Our efforts supplement the counseling, processing and other student loan servicing work performed by the Department through contracts it has with select third parties. The quality and nature of the student loan servicing work performed by the Department has a direct impact on our cohort default rates and we have experienced past performance failures by the Department and its student loan servicers in outreach to students which adversely impact the cohort default rates at our institutions. 
 17

See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – Our institutions could lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs or have other limitations placed upon them if their student loan cohort default rates are greater than the standards set by the Department,” for additional information regarding risks relating to cohort default rates. 
 In September 2021, the Department released the official three-year cohort default rates for the 2018 cohort. Both of our institutions had cohort default rates under the 30% threshold for the 2018 cohort. We increased our student communication, counseling and other efforts in this area beginning in late 2016 and have begun to see improvements in the cohort default rate beginning with the 2016 cohort. A listing of the official 2018, 2017 and 2016 three-year cohort default rates for our institutions is provided in the table below.
  
 | Cohort Default Rates 3-year rate
--------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------
Institution, Main Campus Location | | | 
(Additional locations as defined by accreditors are in parentheses) | 2018 (2) | 2017 (2) | 2016

----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As part of the CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, federal student loan payments and interest were suspended for a period of time, which the Department has periodically extended currently through May 1, 2022. During this period, student loan borrowers have their loans placed in forbearance, and as such, are no longer required to make payments on their federal student loans. Consequently, no further defaults can occur during this period. Based on this forbearance, and more specifically the timing of it, we expect a favorable impact to the 2019-2020 cohort default rates, with the expectation that these rates will be lower as compared to 2018, which were also favorably impacted by the forbearance to a lesser extent. After the forbearance ends, all students will need to resume their next normally scheduled payment. It is unclear how many students will commence their regularly scheduled payments when the forbearance expires, and whether the loan servicers will be able to handle the volume of borrowers resuming repayment obligations all at the same time. As a result, whether this forbearance has any negative impact on future cohorts is unclear. 
 Borrower Defense to Repayment
 On October 28, 2016, the Department adopted new regulations that cover multiple issues including the processes and standards for the discharge of federal student loans, which are commonly referred to as “borrower defense to repayment” regulations. The Department initially delayed the effective date of these regulations; however, after a successful legal challenge against the delay, the Department published guidance to institutions on March 15, 2019 regarding how to implement the 2016 regulations while noting that a new set of regulations was forthcoming. On September 23, 2019, the Department published new final “borrower defense to repayment” regulations that became effective on July 1, 2020. The new 2019 final borrower defense to repayment regulations are summarized below and will result in a distinct loan discharge process and standards applicable to federal student loans first disbursed after July 1, 2020. Further changes to the borrower defense to repayment regulations are being considered. See Legislative Action and Recent Department Regulatory Initiatives - Negotiated Rulemaking 2021: Affordability and Student Loans” for more information.
 2019 Final Regulations – Summary
Loan Discharge. The 2019 borrower defense to repayment regulations significantly alter how loan discharge applications will be treated by the Department. In addition to adopting the more balanced burden of proof standard of “preponderance of the evidence,” the 2019 regulations provide for a single new federal standard for a misrepresentation claim a student may assert against its school. Under the new standard, an individual borrower may assert a defense to repayment based on the institution’s statement, act, or omission that is false, misleading, or deceptive. To be eligible for relief, the borrower would be required to demonstrate that the misrepresentation (1) was made with knowledge of its false, misleading, or deceptive nature or with a reckless disregard for the truth, (2) was relied upon by the borrower in making an enrollment decision, and (3) caused the student financial harm.
 In addition, the 2019 final regulations eliminate the concept of automatic group loan discharges contained in the 2016 regulations and require individual claims to be made by students and include a process for the institution to provide a defense to any claims asserted. 
 Financial Responsibility. The 2019 final borrower defense to repayment regulations contain a number of triggering events that will result in an institution not qualifying as financially responsible or administratively capable. These triggering events include:

• | an order from the SEC that suspends trading in our stock or revokes the registration of our securities or suspends trading of our stock on its national securities exchange;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18

 
• | failure to timely file required public reports with the SEC without an extension being issued;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | notification by Nasdaq that our stock is not in compliance with its exchange requirements and/or may be delisted; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | two or more concurrent and unresolved discretionary triggering events become mandatory triggering events.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additionally, the 2019 final regulations include more definitive financial events that will cause the Department to re-calculate an institution’s most recent financial responsibility composite score to determine whether the losses or reduction in owner’s equity from the event cause the composite score to fall below 1.0. The composite score is one measure the Department uses to evaluate an institution’s financial responsibility using annual financial statements. These triggering events that can lead to the recalculation of a composite score include, but are not limited to:
  
• | incurring a liability from a settlement, final judgment or final determination arising from an administrative or judicial action or proceeding initiated by a federal or state entity; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if our composite score is below 1.5 and we withdraw owner’s equity, such as through a distribution of dividends.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The 2019 final regulations also keep select discretionary triggering events contained in the 2016 regulations that allow the Department to designate an institution as not financially responsible. These discretionary triggering events include:
  
• | failure to satisfy the 90-10 Rule in any year;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | cohort default rates in excess of 30% for two consecutive years;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | citation from a state licensing or authorizing agency of failing to meet state or agency requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an institution is placed on show-cause, probation or similar adverse action threatening an institution’s accreditation for failure to meet an accreditation standard;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | high annual dropout rates, as determined by the Department; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | violation of a provision or requirement in a loan agreement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 The triggering events in the 2019 final regulations are significantly less subjective than a number of the eliminated triggering events that were included in the 2016 regulations. If any of the triggering events materialize, our institutions may be required to post a letter of credit equal to 10% or more of the institution’s previous year’s annual Title IV disbursements.
 Repayment Rate Disclosure Eliminated. The 2019 final defense to repayment regulations eliminated a separate repayment rate disclosure obligation from the 2016 regulations that applied only to for-profit institutions.
 Student Loans Disbursed Prior to July 1, 2020 
 Prior to the July 1, 2020 effective date of the 2019 final regulations, institutions were required to follow the 2016 regulations, subject to the Department’s guidance and direction. As a result, student loans disbursed between July 1, 2017 and July 1, 2020 will follow the loan discharge processes outlined in the 2016 regulations. The 2016 regulations allow the Department to process discharge claims on a group basis, has a much broader definition of what constitutes an eligible misrepresentation, including inadvertent errors, has a lower burden of proof for students and fewer due process protections for institutions. Student loans disbursed before July 1, 2017 will follow the Department’s original discharge standards and processes that specify that a borrower may assert a defense to repayment based on an act or omission by the school that would give rise to a cause of action under state law. Causes of action under state law are broad and therefore we believe that most student claims would likely give rise to a cause of action under state law.
Pending Borrower Defense to Repayment Applications 
 In May 2021, the Department notified the Company that the Department has several thousand borrower defense applications that make claims regarding the Company’s institutions, including institutions that have ceased operations. As part of the initial fact-finding process, the Department will send individual student claims to the Company and allow the institutions the opportunity to submit responses to the borrower defense applications. A large majority of the claims received involve institutions or campuses that have ceased operations and, in some cases, involve students who attended over 25 years ago. We have submitted initial responses to the claims received which indicate that we believe the applications fail to establish a valid borrower defense and the Department should therefore deny them. We continue to respond to substantial requests for information going back as far as 25 years with respect to these claims. The outcome of the Department’s evaluation of each of these applications is uncertain.
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate - ‘Borrower defense to repayment’ regulations, including closed school discharges, may subject us to significant repayment liability to the Department for discharged federal student loans and posting of substantial letters of credit that may limit our ability to make investments in our business which could negatively impact our future growth,” for more information about risks associated with the borrower defense to repayment regulations.
 Financial Responsibility Standards
 To participate in Title IV Programs, our institutions must either satisfy standards of financial responsibility prescribed by the Department, or post a letter of credit in favor of the Department and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV 
 19

Programs. Pursuant to the Title IV Program regulations, each eligible higher education institution must, among other things, satisfy a quantitative standard of financial responsibility that is based on a weighted average of three annual tests which assess the financial condition of the institution. The three tests measure primary reserve, equity and net income ratios. The Primary Reserve Ratio is a measure of an institution’s financial viability and liquidity. The Equity Ratio is a measure of an institution’s capital resources and its ability to borrow. The Net Income Ratio is a measure of an institution’s profitability. These tests provide three individual scores that are converted into a single composite score. The maximum composite score is 3.0. If the institution achieves a composite score of at least 1.5, it is considered financially responsible without conditions or additional oversight. A composite score from 1.0 to 1.4 is considered to be in “the zone” of financial responsibility, and a composite score of less than 1.0 is not considered to be financially responsible. If an institution is in “the zone” of financial responsibility, the institution may establish eligibility to continue to participate in Title IV Programs on the following alternative bases: 
 •
Zone Alternative. Under what is referred to as the “zone alternative,” an institution may continue to participate in Title IV Programs for up to three years under additional monitoring and reporting procedures but without having to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department. These additional monitoring and reporting procedures include being transferred from the “advance” method of payment of Title IV Program funds to cash monitoring status (referred to as Heightened Cash Monitoring 1, or “HCM1,” status) or to the “reimbursement” or Heightened Cash Monitoring 2 (“HCM2”) methods of payment. If an institution does not achieve a composite score of at least 1.0 in one of the three subsequent years or does not improve its financial condition to attain a composite score of at least 1.5 by the end of the three-year period, the institution must satisfy another alternative standard to continue participating in Title IV Programs.
 •
Letter of Credit Alternative. An institution that fails to meet one of the standards of financial responsibility, including by having a composite score less than 1.5, may demonstrate financial responsibility by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit to the Department in an amount equal to at least 50% of the Title IV Program funds that the institution received during its most recently completed fiscal year.
 •
Provisional Certification. If an institution fails to meet one of the standards of financial responsibility, including by having a composite score less than 1.5, the Department may permit the institution to participate under provisional certification for up to three years. If the Department permits an institution to participate under provisional certification, an institution must comply with the requirements of the “zone alternative,” including being transferred to the HCM1, HCM2 or “reimbursement” method of payment of Title IV Program funds, and must submit a letter of credit to the Department in an amount determined by the Department which can range from 10%-100% of the Title IV Program funds that the institution received during its most recently completed fiscal year. If an institution is still not financially responsible at the end of the period of provisional certification, including because it has a composite score of less than 1.0, the Department may again permit provisional certification subject to the terms the Department determines appropriate.
 The Department applies its quantitative financial responsibility tests annually based on an institution’s audited financial statements and may apply the tests if an institution undergoes a change in control or under other circumstances. The Department also may apply the tests to the parent company of our institutions, and to other related entities. Our composite score for the consolidated entity for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.0, and our preliminary calculation for the year ended December 31, 2021 is also 3.0, which is the highest possible score and considered financially responsible without conditions or additional oversight. If in the future we are required to satisfy The Department’s standards of financial responsibility on an alternative basis, including potentially by posting irrevocable letters of credit, we may not have the capacity to post these letters of credit.
 Accreditor and state regulatory requirements also address financial responsibility, and these requirements vary among agencies and also are different from the Department requirements. Any developments relating to our satisfaction of the Department’s financial responsibility requirements may lead to additional focus or review by our accreditors or applicable state agencies regarding their respective financial responsibility requirements.
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Field in Which We Operate – A failure to demonstrate ‘financial responsibility’ or ‘administrative capability’ would have negative impacts on our operations,” for additional information regarding risks relating to the financial responsibility standards.
 Return and Refunds of Title IV Program Funds
 An institution participating in Title IV Programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned Title IV Program funds that were disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs, and must return those funds to the government in a timely manner.
 The portion of tuition and fee payments billed to students but not yet earned is recorded as deferred tuition revenue and reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets, as such amounts represent revenue that we expect to earn within the next year. If a student withdraws from one of our institutions prior to the completion of the academic term, we refund the portion of tuition and fees already paid that we are not entitled to retain, pursuant to applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards and our refund policy. The amount of funds to be refunded on behalf of a student is calculated based upon the period of time in which the student has attended classes and the amount of tuition and fees paid by the student as of the student’s withdrawal date.
 20

Institutions are required to return any unearned Title IV funds within 45 days of the date the institution determines that the student has withdrawn. An institution that is found to be in non-compliance with the Department refund requirements for either of the last two completed fiscal years must post a letter of credit in favor of the Department in an amount equal to 25% of the total Title IV Program returns that were paid or should have been paid by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year. As of December 31, 2021, we have posted no letters of credit in favor of the Department due to non-compliance with the Department refund requirements.
 Change of Ownership or Control
 When an institution undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, as that term is defined by the state in which it is located, its accrediting agency and the Department, it must secure the approval of those agencies to continue to operate and to continue to participate in Title IV Programs. If the institution is unable to re-establish state authorization and accreditation requirements and satisfy other requirements for certification by the Department, the institution may lose its authority to operate and its ability to participate in Title IV Programs. An institution whose change of ownership or control is approved by the appropriate authorities is nonetheless provisionally re-certified by the Department for a period of up to three years. Transactions or events that constitute a change of control by one or more of the applicable regulatory agencies, including the Department, applicable state agencies, and accrediting bodies, include the acquisition of an institution from another entity or significant acquisition or disposition of an institution’s equity. It is possible that some of these events may occur without our control. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in obtaining, a required approval of any change in control from the Department, applicable state agencies, or accrediting agencies could impair our ability or the ability of the affected institutions to participate in Title IV Programs. If we were to undergo a change of control and our institutions failed to obtain the required approvals from applicable regulatory agencies in a timely manner, our student population, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
 When we acquire an institution that is eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, that institution typically undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control as defined by the Department. Our acquired institutions in the past have undergone a certification review under our ownership and have been certified to participate in Title IV Programs on a provisional basis, per Department requirements, until such time that the Department signs a new program participation agreement with the institution. Currently, neither of our institutions is subject to provisional certification status due to the Department’s change of ownership criteria. The potential adverse effects of a change of control under Department regulations may influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance or redemption of our common stock.
 Opening New Institutions, Start-up Campuses and Adding Educational Programs
 The Higher Education Act generally requires that for-profit institutions be fully operational for two years before applying to participate in Title IV Programs. However, an institution that is certified to participate in Title IV Programs may establish a start-up branch campus or location and participate in Title IV Programs at the start-up campus without reference to the two-year requirement if the start-up campus has received all of the necessary state and accrediting agency approvals, has been reported to the Department, and meets certain other criteria as defined by the Department. Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, a start-up branch campus may also be required to obtain approval from the Department to be able to participate in Title IV Programs.
 In addition to the Department regulations, certain of the state and accrediting agencies with jurisdiction over our institutions have requirements that may affect our ability to open a new institution, open a start-up branch campus or location of one of our existing institutions, or begin offering a new educational program at one of our institutions. If we establish a new institution, add a new branch start-up campus, or expand program offerings at any of our institutions without obtaining the required approvals, we would likely be liable for repayment of Title IV Program funds provided to students at that institution or branch campus or enrolled in that educational program, and we could also be subject to sanctions. Also, if we are unable to obtain the approvals from the Department, applicable state regulatory agencies, and accrediting agencies for any new institutions, branch campuses, or program offerings where such approvals are required, or to obtain such approvals in a timely manner, our ability to grow our business would be impaired and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.  
 Administrative Capability
 The Department regulations specify extensive criteria that an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in Title IV Programs. These criteria relate to, among other things, institutional staffing, operational standards such as procedures for disbursing and safeguarding Title IV Program funds, timely submission of accurate reports to the Department and various other procedural matters. If an institution fails to satisfy any of the Department’s criteria for administrative capability, the Department may require the repayment of Title IV Program funds disbursed by the institution, place the institution on provisional certification status, require the institution to receive Title IV Program funds under another funding arrangement, impose fines or limit or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV Programs.
Restrictions on Payment of Commissions, Bonuses and Other Incentive Payments
 An institution participating in Title IV Programs cannot provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or Title IV financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student 
 21

recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance. Regulations issued in October 2010 which became effective July 1, 2011 rescinded previously issued Department guidance and “safe harbors” relied upon by higher education institutions in making decisions how they managed, compensated and promoted individuals engaged in student recruiting and the awarding of financial aid and their supervisors. The elimination of these “safe harbor” protections and guidance required us to terminate certain compensation payments to our affected employees and to implement changes in contractual and other arrangements with third parties to change structures formerly allowed under Department rules, and has had an impact on our ability to compensate, recruit, retain and motivate affected admissions and other affected employees as well as on our business arrangements with third-party lead generators and other marketing vendors. In September 2016, the Department’s Office of Inspector General released a revised audit guide applicable specifically to for-profit schools that requires an annual audit to review compliance with the incentive compensation restrictions.
 Further, the Department provided very limited published guidance regarding this rule and does not establish clear criteria for compliance for many circumstances. If the Department determined that an institution’s compensation practices violated these standards, the Department could subject the institution to substantial monetary fines, penalties or other sanctions.
 Substantial Misrepresentation
 The Higher Education Act prohibits an institution participating in Title IV Programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation of the nature of its educational programs, financial charges, graduate employability or its relationship with the Department. Under the Department’s rules, a "misrepresentation" is any statement (made in writing, visually, orally or otherwise) made by the institution, any of its representatives or a third party that provides educational programs, marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services to the institution, that is false, erroneous or has the likelihood or tendency to deceive, and a "substantial misrepresentation" is any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person’s detriment. Considering the broad definition of “substantial misrepresentation,” it is possible that, despite our training efforts and compliance programs, our institutions' employees or service providers may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations. If the Department determines that one of our institutions has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, the Department may revoke the institution’s program participation agreement, deny applications from the institution for approval of new programs or locations or other matters, or initiate proceedings under its borrower defense to repayment regulations to fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs; the institution could also be exposed to increased risk of action under the Federal False Claims Act.
