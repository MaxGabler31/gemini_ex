 Item 1. Business
 General
 We are a specialty retailer of home furnishings in the United States. As of January 29, 2022, we operated a total of 361 stores in 35 states as well as an e-commerce website, www.kirklands.com, under the Kirkland’s Home brand. We were founded in 1966, and our current parent corporation, Kirkland’s, Inc., was incorporated in 1981. We provide our customers with an engaging shopping experience characterized by a curated, affordable selection of home furnishings along with inspirational design ideas. This combination of quality and stylish merchandise, value pricing and a stimulating online and store experience allows our customers to furnish their home at a great value.
Business Strategy
 Our mission is to transform Kirkland’s into a high-performing specialty home-furnishing retailer offering value, quality and design with a differentiated omni-channel experience for our customers. We are in the process of transforming our brand from an accessories retailer to a complete home furnishings retailer. We are upgrading quality and style and increasing our mix of larger ticket categories, including furniture. We are also offering a larger selection of modern styled merchandise in addition to our traditionally styled merchandise. We are focused on trying to acquire high-value home furnishings customers. We believe the following four components of our business strategy are key to repositioning our brand and our future growth and success.
 Merchandise. Great product at an amazing value is the heart of our brand. We are focused on becoming a true home furnishings retailer offering product categories for the whole home. Our style is casual, and it can easily be blended into a modern or traditionally styled home. We offer a cohesive, seasonally relevant color palette and a curated assortment that makes styling a home effortless. We continue to accelerate our growth in key product categories including furniture, textiles and tabletop, while still offering variety in home accessories, home fragrance and seasonal product. We have an extended assortment online that rounds out our store assortment, and also offers our customers additional products such as cookware and small appliances. We are passionate about continuing to elevate style and quality, while keeping a strong value proposition for our customer.
 Customer. Our strategy is to grow our customer base and extend the reach of our brand. We will generate awareness of our brand and create relevance through new positioning and optimized media investment. Once acquired, we continue to improve customer retention and drive results with improved visibility to consumer data and through customer centric programs like our loyalty program. Our lean infrastructure allows us to be nimble in our response to changes in customer preferences and buying behaviors.
 Omni-channel experience. Our strategy includes improving our website platform to provide an engaging shopping experience for our customers, which includes an improved checkout process with more payment options, enhanced search functionality and artificial intelligence (“AI”) tools, which allow in-room viewing of our expanded assortment of merchandise. Our stores remain a critical piece of the fulfillment of e-commerce orders, as they allow the customer to reserve products online and pick up in store at their convenience. Our store fulfillment option improves order profitability and gives the opportunity for store add on sales. Our in-store strategy includes training and technology that focus on design assistance and a selling mindset, along with increased focus on extended aisle options available online as stores assist customers with their orders.
 Infrastructure Improvements. Our store rationalization strategy includes refreshing mid- and high-performing stores, exiting low-performing stores and potentially relocating some under-performing stores to better locations. In the next three-to-five years, we expect to close or relocate low performing stores, whose profitability has deteriorated, and refresh the remaining store base. We expect to refresh a portion of our stores each year with lighter walls, wood flooring and LED lighting, enabling a cleaner backdrop for our upgraded merchandise. We also plan to focus on our supply chain with improved service-level agreements for e-commerce fulfillment and testing new white glove delivery options for in-home delivery of furniture.

Merchandising
 Our merchandising strategy is to offer an elevated style at an amazing value. We are passionate about our color and design direction each season, while working with our partners around the globe to develop and source quality home furnishings and décor for the whole home. We maintain a strong pricing strategy with affordable prices representing a great value to our customers along with “better” and “best” options across all product categories. Our merchant team thoughtfully curates the assortment each season to ensure we maintain a healthy SKU count and a cohesive style point of view.
 Daily review of sales and product margin information helps us to maximize the productivity of successful products and categories and minimize the accumulation of slow-moving inventory. We regularly monitor the sell-through of our merchandise; therefore, the number and make-up of our active items is continuously changing based on changes in selling trends. The composition of our merchandise assortment is relatively consistent across our store base with an extended assortment online. Strategic partnerships with brands such as KitchenAid®, Cuisinart® and Viking® add name brand recognition to our expanded online assortment.
 We continually strive to increase the perceived value of Kirkland’s products to our customers through our thoughtfully curated assortments and inspirational visual presentations. Our shoppers regularly experience the satisfaction of paying noticeably less for equally well-designed products compared to those sold by other specialty retailers. We use temporary promotions throughout the year featuring specific categories of merchandise along with select coupon discounts. We believe our great style and value-oriented pricing strategy, coupled with an adherence to high quality standards, is an important element in establishing our distinct brand identity and solidifying our connection with our customers.
 Our merchandise categories include holiday décor, furniture, textiles, ornamental wall décor, decorative accessories, art, mirrors, home fragrance, lighting, housewares, floral and gift. The following table presents the percentage of net sales contributed by our merchandise categories based on our current category structure over the last three fiscal years:
 
 
 | % of Net Sales | 
-----------------------+----------------+----
Merchandise Category | Fiscal 2021 | | | Fiscal 2020 | | Fiscal 2019
Holiday | | 19 | % | | 22 | % | 19 | %
Furniture | | 16 | | | 15 | | 13 | 
Textiles | | 11 | | | 11 | | 9 |

Gift | | 1 | | | 1 | | 3 | 
Total | | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

 
Our visual merchandising strategy is evolving to meet the vision of our elevated assortment. We strive to inspire our customers with a mix of inspirational lifestyle settings and impactful key item placement. Our visual merchandising team creates thoughtful, cohesive guides for our stores, utilizing fresh, creative window displays and maximizing the productivity of our fixtures. We plan to elevate our creative visual merchandising direction over the next one-to-two years as we continue to elevate our style point-of-view.

Buying and Inventory Management
 Our buying team selects all of our products, negotiates with vendors and works with our merchandise planning and allocation team to optimize merchandise quantity and mix by category in our stores and on our website. We purchase merchandise from approximately 200 vendors, with no vendor representing more than 10% of our purchases during fiscal 2021. Approximately 90 core vendors accounted for 90% of our merchandise purchases during fiscal 2021.
 Our global sourcing team manages our sourcing strategies. Our global sourcing initiative began in fiscal 2019, and it has successfully diversified our purchases from primarily Chinese vendors to suppliers in multiple countries. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, direct sourcing accounted for approximately 40% and 20% of our merchandise receipts, respectively. We partner with three sourcing agents that assist with sourcing activities in China, India, Southeast Asia and Europe. Our merchandise comes from numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers. For fiscal 2021, the manufacturing countries of origin for our merchandise receipts were approximately 76% China, 11% India, 7% United States, 4% Vietnam and 2% other countries. Our strategy is to continue to diversify sourcing opportunities and minimize risks to gain competitive advantages through a streamlined process. We plan to increase the percentage of merchandise that we directly source from manufacturers, targeting 70% of total merchandise purchases by fiscal 2025.
 Our merchandise planning and allocation team manages inventory levels and the allocation between stores and e-commerce fulfillment locations to maximize sales, sell-through and margin. Our stores are classified internally for assortment purposes based on multiple criteria including sales volume, size, location and historical performance. Although our stores carry similar merchandise, the variety and depth of products in a given store may vary depending on the store’s classification. Where applicable, inventory purchases and allocations are also tailored based on regional or demographic differences between stores in selected categories. On our website, we carry a larger selection of merchandise than in our store locations, including online-exclusive items.
 Store Operations
 Our stores are designed and managed to make shopping an inspiring experience and to maximize sales and operating efficiencies. Stores are strategically arranged to provide for optimal product placement and visual display that can be changed for seasonal product and promotions. We expect to refresh a portion of our stores each year with lighter walls, wood flooring and LED lighting, enabling a cleaner backdrop for our upgraded merchandise. Store training is focused on increasing customer design assistance and a selling mindset, as we aim to furnish an entire room for our customer.
 Store operations is managed by corporate personnel, three regional directors and 17 district managers, who generally have responsibility for an average of 21 stores within a geographic district, and store managers. Store managers and assistant managers are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the store, including sales, customer service, merchandise display, human resource functions and store security. A typical store operates seven days a week with an average of 8 to 15 employees, including a combination of full and part-time employees, depending on the volume of the store and the season. Additional part-time employees are typically hired to assist with the increased traffic and sales volume in the fourth quarter of the calendar year.
 Real Estate
 Our store rationalization strategy includes refreshing mid- and high-performing stores, exiting low-performing stores and potentially relocating some under-performing stores to better locations. We are prioritizing sustained improvement in overall profitability and developing a future state plan for infrastructure that complements our omni-channel concept and improves the customer experience. We anticipate additional store closures and limited store openings as we execute our store rationalization strategy over the next several years. We believe our ideal store count should be approximately 350 stores.
 As of January 29, 2022, we operated 361 stores, including 310 “power” strip or “lifestyle” centers, 25 freestanding locations, 12 mall locations and 14 outlet centers.

The following table provides a history of our store openings and closings for the last five fiscal years:

-----------------------------------+-------------+-----+---+-------------+-----+-------------+-------------+---+-------------+----
Stores open at beginning of period | | 373 | | | 432 | | 428 | | | 418 | | 404 | 
New store openings | | 4 | | | — | | 5 | | | 25 | | 31 |

Stores open at end of period | | 361 | | | 373 | | 432 | | | 428 | | 418 | 

Distribution and Logistics
 We have a comprehensive approach to the management of our merchandise supply chain. We continuously evaluate the impact of our omni-channel strategies on our business, and frequently implement enhancements to our supply chain infrastructure and warehouse management system to support store and e-commerce fulfillment.
 Our main retail distribution center in Jackson, Tennessee services approximately 77% of our stores and a third-party operated retail fulfillment facility in Lancaster, Texas services the other 23% of our stores. Our main Jackson, Tennessee retail distribution center also supports our e-commerce fulfillment and our two smaller e-commerce order fulfillment centers in North Las Vegas, Nevada and Winchester, Virginia help reduce the time to deliver customer orders, fixed costs and shipping expenses. We also have a third-party operated west coast distribution operation, which provides for the improved flow of merchandise through our supply chain network. By virtue of this operation, we gain control of merchandise when it enters the west coast port, which allows us to allocate and distribute inventory directly to any of our retail or e-commerce fulfillment distribution centers.
 Our upgraded internal warehouse management system provides increased functionality that supports e-commerce fulfillment at our e-commerce fulfillment locations. In early fiscal 2022, we upgraded our internal warehouse management system related to store fulfillment at our Jackson, Tennessee location.
 We currently utilize third-party carriers to transport merchandise from our Jackson, Tennessee and Lancaster, Texas distribution centers to our stores. Almost all of our stores utilize direct, full truckload deliveries, which results in lower distribution costs and allows our field personnel to better schedule store associates for the receiving process. 
 Information Technology
 We have invested considerable resources in our information technology to manage the purchase, pricing and distribution of our merchandise, improve our operating efficiencies and support e-commerce operations. Our key management information systems include a merchandise management system, point-of-sale system, an e-commerce platform, an e-commerce order management system, a warehouse management system, a financial system and a labor management tool. Our merchandise management system provides us with tools to manage aspects of our merchandise assortment and integrates merchandising and inventory management applications, including inventory tracking, purchase order management, inventory allocation and replenishment, sales audit and invoice matching, which interfaces with our warehouse management and financial system.
 We continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness. Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations, and refreshes and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance. We continue to strengthen the security of our information technology and invest in technology to support stores, e-commerce, distribution centers, omni-channel expansion and business intelligence tools. These efforts are directed toward improving business processes, maintaining secure, efficient and stable systems, implementing new features and enabling the continued growth and success of our business.
 Information Security
 Given the importance of information security, in 2021 we engaged an IT security partner to conduct a thorough Cyber Security Risk Assessment for us. The assessment was completed using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) framework, and the results were shared with and discussed with the Audit Committee of our 
 7

Board of Directors. In addition to reviewing this report, our Audit Committee regularly receives reports and updates from our Chief Financial Officer and our Chief Technology Officer regarding our program for managing our information security risks, including data privacy and protection risks faced by the Company. Our information security risk mitigation efforts include mandatory online information security and protection training for Kirkland’s employees, the introduction of information security concepts as part of our new employee onboarding process and enhanced training for associates who handle payment card data. We also maintain a cyber insurance policy that provides coverage for IT security breaches.
Marketing
 Our brand positioning aligns to the evolution of our product assortment and clearly communicates our value proposition of, “Curated Design, Amazing Value.” Our marketing communicates that Kirkland’s Home is a shopping destination that offers on trend, quality home merchandise at a value to our customers. We believe that just because you are practical with your time and money doesn’t mean that your passion for home doesn’t run deep. Our marketing showcases our products in a casual, surprising and approachable way that is both inspirational and attainable.
 Our marketing strategy includes a balanced approach to customer retention and acquisition. Our overall marketing efforts encompass various techniques including digital marketing, paid search and social media initiatives. We manage a database of customers and communicate with them via targeted emails featuring new products, marketing events and special offers.
 We are focused on improving the customer experience through our loyalty program, K-club, and our private label credit card financing. Our customer loyalty program rewards customers for shopping with us, as well as interacting with Kirkland's across channels. This interaction allows us to foster stronger and lasting relationships with our customers. The key benefits of this program include:
  
• | Points on every purchase to redeem for valuable rewards;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | Birthday surprises;
--+--------------------


• | Special offers, bonus days, annual bonuses and exclusive access;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monthly $500 sweepstakes entry; and
--+------------------------------------


• | VIP shopping hours.
--+--------------------

 Our private label Kirkland’s credit card through Wells Fargo offers financing options including "6-months no interest" and "12-months no interest" financing for purchases over $250 and $500, respectively. 
 Omni-Channel
 Our strategy includes improving our website platform to provide an engaging shopping experience for our customers, which includes an improved checkout process with more payment options, enhanced search functionality and AI tools, which allow in-room viewing of our expanded assortment of merchandise. 
 As part of our omni-channel growth strategy, we are focused on improving comparable sales performance, driven by e-commerce growth. We expect e-commerce to grow as a percentage of our total business, but also are focused on improving the contribution of our remaining store base, which is an integral part of our omni-channel strategy and supports improved profitability of our e-commerce business as a fulfillment channel.
 We have multiple online fulfillment options, including delivery to the customer’s home directly from our warehouses, stores or vendors, ship-to-store and buy online and pickup in-store programs (“BOPIS”). Our BOPIS program includes optional curbside pickup, which provides convenient access for customers to pick up merchandise from our store locations without leaving their vehicle. We also plan to support our expanding furniture offerings with a white glove delivery program to deliver merchandise inside the customer’s home, which will be key to the customer experience and opens markets outside of our store base for oversized product.

Trademarks
 All of our stores operate under the names “Kirkland’s”, “Kirkland’s Home”, “Kirkland’s Home Outlet”, “Kirkland’s Outlet,” and “The Kirkland Collection.”
 We have registered several trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register that are used in connection with the Kirkland’s stores, including KIRKLAND’S® logo design, KIRKLAND’S®, THE KIRKLAND COLLECTION®, KIRKLAND’S OUTLET®, KIRKLAND’S HOME®, MARKET AND VINE™, SIMPLE THINGS BY KIRKLAND’S®, LOVE THE POSSIBILITIES and LOVE THE PRICE®. These marks have historically been important components in our merchandising and marketing strategy. We are not aware of any claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use our marks in the United States.
Competition
 The retail market for home furnishings is highly competitive. Accordingly, we compete against a diverse group of retailers, including specialty stores, department stores, discount stores, catalog and internet-based retailers, which sell similar lines of merchandise to those carried by us. Some of our main competitors include HomeGoods, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Cost Plus World Market, Crate & Barrel, Williams-Sonoma, Inc., Hobby Lobby, Pier 1 Imports, At Home, Target, Ebay, Amazon and Wayfair. We believe that the principal competitive factors influencing our business are merchandise selection, price, customer service, visual appeal of our stores and our convenient store locations. We believe we compete effectively with other retailers due to our experience in identifying a curated collection of quality and stylish merchandise, pricing it to be attractive to our target customer, presenting it in a visually appealing manner and providing an engaging shopping experience.
 In addition to competing for customers, we compete with other retailers for suitable store locations and qualified management personnel and sales associates. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K, under the sub-caption “Risks Related to Competition” for further discussion of our competitive environment.
 Human Capital
 Overview. We employed approximately 1,000 full-time and 3,500 part-time employees as of January 29, 2022. The number of our employees fluctuates with seasonal needs. We generally experience our highest level of employment during the fourth fiscal quarter. Of our 4,500 employees, approximately 4,050 work at stores, 230 work at our distribution centers and 220 work in corporate support functions. As of January 29, 2022, none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we maintain a positive relationship with our employees.
 Philosophy and culture. Our goal is to employ a highly engaged, high-performing workforce that is happy and empowered. Our people philosophy is based on creating a workplace culture where all employees feel respected, valued and inspired. We actively engage employees in regular opportunities to feel connected to our goals and the communities in which we operate. We celebrate and prioritize diversity and inclusion and position employees for success with the tools and resources they need to thrive.
 Personnel recruitment and training. We believe our continued success is dependent in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate quality employees. In particular, our success depends on our ability to promote and recruit qualified corporate personnel, distribution center employees, district and store managers and full-time and part-time store employees. District managers are primarily responsible for recruiting new store managers, while store managers are responsible for the hiring and training of store employees. We constantly look for motivated and talented people to promote from within the Company, in addition to recruiting outside of Kirkland’s. All store employees are trained utilizing the “K University” training program. Store managers train at a designated “training store” where they work directly with a qualified training store manager. District managers onboard at our corporate office in addition to spending time with designated district manager trainers. Corporate and distribution center employees receive training at their respective locations.

Compensation and benefits. We are committed to providing competitive pay and benefits to our employees. Corporate management, distribution center leadership, regional directors, district managers and store managers are compensated with base pay plus periodic bonuses based on performance. Store and distribution center non-management employees are compensated on an hourly basis in addition to periodic contests and rewards. Many of our employees participate in one of our various bonus incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon department or Company performance. We also provide our eligible employees the opportunity to participate in a 401(k) retirement savings plan, which includes a 100% Company match of the employee’s elective bi-weekly contributions up to 4% of eligible compensation. We share in the cost of health insurance provided to eligible employees, and we offer our employees a discount on merchandise purchased from our stores.
 Safety. Employee health and safety is continuously promoted through training and resources across our operations. We develop and administer Company-wide policies to ensure the safety of each employee and compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented numerous safety measures including adding work from home flexibility for corporate employees, adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home, increasing cleaning protocols, establishing social distancing procedures, providing additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies, modifying work spaces with plexiglass dividers, limiting travel and requiring masks to be worn in accordance with CDC guidelines and local ordinances. We have also implemented regular communications to employees regarding the impacts of COVID-19, new health and safety procedures and protocols to address actual or suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposures.
 Diversity. Our leadership team is comprised of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer/Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer and seven vice presidents who, collectively, have management responsibility for our business areas including omni-channel operations, finance, supply chain, legal, merchandising, human resources, marketing and information technology. Our leadership team places significant focus and attention on matters concerning our human capital assets including their capability development, succession planning and diversity. Accordingly, we regularly review talent development and succession plans for each of our functions, to identify and develop a pipeline of talent to maintain business operations. We are also focused on engaging our existing workforce through policies and programs promoting workplace diversity and inclusion. Currently, half of the members of our leadership team are women. We are committed to our continued efforts to promote diversity and foster an inclusive work environment that supports the communities we serve. As part of this commitment in 2021, we created an employee Diversity Council with cross-organizational representatives who advocate for and monitor our commitment to diversity and inclusion. We recruit the best people for the job regardless of race, gender, ethnicity or other protected traits, and it is our policy to fully comply with all laws applicable to discrimination in the workplace.
 Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
 We have made ESG and diversity and inclusion a priority throughout our organization and the communities we serve. As our business evolves over time, sustainability will continue to increase in significance as we revise and develop our stores and e-commerce operations. However, as we note in “Item 2. Properties” of this 10-K, we currently lease all of our properties, so there are limited actions we can take with respect to environmental sustainability issues. Nevertheless, we seek to ensure that all future changes to our stores, including any possible real property acquisitions, are done in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. Our leadership team has worked with our ESG Steering Committee and our Board to develop short-term and long-term ESG strategies. One of our sustainability pledges is to strengthen the local communities in which we operate, and our various corporate giving initiatives have helped elevate our impact on these local communities.
 In September 2021, we added an ESG section to our Investor Relations website at www.kirklands.com under “Investor and Media Relations – ESG.” The documents and materials published there highlight our ongoing ESG initiatives. The information included in, referenced to, or otherwise accessible through our website, is not incorporated by reference in, or considered to be part of, this Report on Form 10-K or any document unless expressly incorporated by reference therein.

Governmental Regulations
 
We must comply with various federal, state and local regulations, including regulations relating to consumer products and consumer protection, advertising and marketing, labor and employment, data protection and privacy, intellectual property, the environment and taxes. In addition, we must comply with United States customs laws and similar laws of other countries associated with the import of our merchandise. Ensuring our compliance with these various laws and regulations, and keeping abreast of changes to the legal and regulatory landscape present in our industry, requires us to expend considerable resources. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors under the sub-caption “Risks Related to New Legislation, Regulation, and Litigation.”
Seasonality
 We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, substantial seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating results. We believe this is the general pattern typical of our segment of the retail industry and expect that this pattern will continue in the future. Due to the importance of the fall selling season, which includes Thanksgiving and Christmas, the last quarter of our fiscal year has historically contributed, and is expected to continue to contribute, a disproportionate amount of our net sales, net income and cash flow for the entire fiscal year.
COVID-19 Pandemic
 The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant public health concerns as well as economic disruption, uncertainty and volatility, which materially affected our business operations in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact of emerging variant strains of the COVID-19 virus, on all facets of our business, which includes the impact on our employees, customers, suppliers, vendors, business partners and supply chain networks. While the duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and its continued impact on the global economy remains uncertain, we expect that our business operations and results of operations, including our net sales, earnings and cash flows will continue to be materially impacted.
 The health and safety of our employees and customers are the primary concerns of our management team. We have taken and continue to take numerous actions to promote health and safety, including, providing personal protective equipment to our employees, requiring mask protocols in our facilities, offering contactless shopping experiences, administering cleaning and sanitation procedures and promoting social distancing. All of our stores and distribution centers are currently open with enhanced safety measures. For additional information on risks related to COVID-19, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the sub-caption “Risks Related to COVID-19.”
 Availability of SEC Reports
 We file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K with the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
