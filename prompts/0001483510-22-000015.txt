GENERAL

Grounded in versatility and powered by a styling community, Express is a modern, multichannel apparel and accessories brand whose purpose is to Create Confidence & Inspire Self-Expression. Launched in 1980 with the idea that style, quality and value should all be found in one place, Express has been a part of some of the most important and culture-defining fashion trends. The Express Edit design philosophy ensures that the brand is always "of the now" so people can get dressed for every day and any occasion knowing that Express can help them look the way they want to look and feel the way they want to feel.
As of January 29, 2022, we operated 561 stores across the United States and in Puerto Rico, including 203 factory outlet stores. Our stores are located primarily in high-traffic shopping malls, lifestyle centers, outlet centers, and street locations, and average approximately 8,400 gross square feet. We also sell our products through our online store, www.express.com, our mobile app, as well as through franchisees who operate Express locations in Latin America pursuant to franchise agreements. Our 2021 merchandise sales were comprised of 91% apparel and 9% accessories and other and 57% women's and 43% men's.

COMPETITION AND COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS

The apparel retail market is highly competitive. We compete with other omni-channel retailers that engage in the retail sale of women's and men's apparel, accessories, and similar merchandise. We compete on the basis of a combination of factors, including, among others, style, breadth, quality, and price of merchandise offered, in-store and online customer experience, and brand image. 
We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors as follows:
•Established Lifestyle Brand
With more than 40 years of heritage, we are a fashion-forward apparel brand and style community whose purpose is to create confidence and inspire self-expression. From wardrobe essentials to the latest trends, we outfit doers, makers, movers and shakers with clothing designed for real-life versatility. At Express, we believe that everyone should dream big and dress accordingly. Our clothing is an edit of the top trends to create a modern, flexible wardrobe. The Express brand differentiates itself by offering terrific value, great fits, premium fabrics and impeccable details, with each style designed to help you express your style.
•Reengineered Go To Market Processes
We implemented our new go to market process in the Spring of 2020 and our teams have been better aligned, our products speed to market has increased, and we have better cross functional coordination in the field and at the home office. This transformed process began with a unified brand presentation increasing our speed to market, streamlining our calendars, and ensuring better integration across all of our marketing touchpoints. We have achieved our goal of being more efficient, more effective, and more 
EXPRESS, INC. | 2021 Form 10-K | 5


connected across functions and faster to market at a reduced cost. We have also worked more closely with our suppliers to achieve better alignment on the aesthetics, fit and quality our customers want. All of these efforts continue to help us bring more newness in our assortment more often and mitigate the supply chain challenges facing us today.
•Strong and Experienced Team
Our existing team, at and below the leadership level, has extensive experience in the retail apparel industry, including depth in the areas of fashion design and merchandising, supply chain management, marketing, customer experience, eCommerce, store operations, technology, planning and allocation, and real estate, as well as other diverse business experiences that we believe are valuable to us as we continue to execute our growth strategy. Experience within Express extends deep into our organization, including district and store managers.

OUR PRODUCTS

The majority of our apparel designs are created by our in-house design team. We believe every day is an occasion and we want to help our customers dress for it. We established a design and merchandising philosophy called the Express Edit that supports our brand promise: “to edit the best of now for real life versatility”. We are designing best-in-class, modern product at incredible value. Below are the four ideas that define the Express Edit:
•Versatility Adds Value
◦Create modern-day dressing experience with multiple ways to wear at work, at play, during the day and during the night
•New & Now
◦Meet our customers’ desire for newness by understanding where fashion is now and looking ahead to where it's going through monthly deliveries in key categories that continue to update a seasonal wardrobe
•Drive Denim
◦Denim is the foundation of every modern wardrobe. We completely reinvented our assortments and are delivering premium jeans under $100
•Add an Accessory
◦Accessories are a fashion entry point and an add-on to an outfit at an opening price point
We plan our product assortments and display them in our stores and online in a coordinated manner to encourage our customers to purchase items that can be worn in multiple ways for multiple wearing occasions. We believe this allows us to better meet our customers' shopping objectives while differentiating our product offerings from competitors. On average, our customers purchase two to three items per transaction.

OMNICHANNEL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

We are committed to enhancing our omnichannel customer experience that offers a seamless shopping experience whether the customer is shopping in a store or online through a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. We believe the lines between our store and eCommerce channels are disappearing as customers increasingly interact with us both in-store and online and often through mobile devices while in stores. As a result, we are focused on leveraging the best of both channels to create an exceptional omnichannel shopping experience. 
We design our stores to create a distinctive and engaging shopping environment and project our image of Express as a fashion authority. Our stores feature a vibrant and youthful look, bright signage, and popular music. Our stores are constructed and finished to allow us to efficiently shift merchandise displays throughout the year as seasons dictate. To further enhance our customers' experience, we seek to attract enthusiastic store associates who are committed to offering a high level of customer service. We believe our managers and associates are well equipped to assist and inspire our customers as a result of education and training we provide, the culture of accountability we foster, the incentives we offer, and the decision-making authority we grant to store managers. On average, our store managers have been with Express for approximately six years.

Similar to our stores, our eCommerce capabilities focus on creating an engaging and easy shopping experience that supports a vibrant fashion consumer, whether on a mobile device, tablet, or desktop, with a particular focus on the mobile experience. We recognize the growing preference for online shopping and continue to make enhancements to the online customer experience through improved search, site navigation and checkout capabilities, and targeted customer messaging, making shopping easier for customers. During 2021, we focused on advancing our eCommerce and omnichannel experience, particularly as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in more of our customers continuing to shop online. We did this with enhanced and expanded buy-online-pick-up-in-store and ship-from-store functionalities, both of which contribute to more efficient, and effective inventory management. Additionally, we enhanced the way we engage and service our customers in the digital channel. We expanded our Digital Stylist program by increasing the resources available, to provide more real-time, virtual assistance to express.com customers. We plan to optimize our online product assortment through product extensions, and expand and grow our Marketplace / Labels we Love business with the addition of new categories such as active, swimwear, and intimates.

MARKETING

We use a variety of marketing vehicles designed to acquire new customers, engage with existing customers, increase customer traffic in-store and online, and build brand loyalty. We seek to optimize our customer relationship management ("CRM") through a number of tactics, such as test and learn programs, circulation and offer models, and greater use of digital marketing.
We use a proprietary customer database, together with data analytics, to customize our communications and make targeted offers to customers in an effort to increase customer traffic in-store and online and to increase conversion. During the first quarter of 2021, we rebranded and relaunched our Express Insider loyalty program. We brought in 2.7 million new customers and reactivated 2.2 million lapsed customers since the relaunch. We ended the year with the highest number of active loyalty members in the Company's history.
We implemented new participation tiers and earnings structure, new benefits, a digital wallet feature, and made it easier for customers to earn, track, and redeem their benefits. Our Express Insider members have tremendous lifetime value to Express. This program is a critical factor in gaining additional share of existing customers' spend and bringing new customers into the brand. We also offer a private-label credit card through an agreement (the "Card Agreement") with Comenity Bank (the “Bank”) under which the Bank owns the credit card accounts and Alliance Data Systems Corporation provides services to our private-label credit card customers. All of our proprietary credit cards carry the Express logo.

TECHNOLOGY

We rely on information technology to operate our business. Our information technology provides a full range of business process support and information to our store, eCommerce, merchandising, financial, and real estate teams. We utilize a combination of customized and industry standard software systems to provide various functions related to point-of-sale, inventory management, design, planning and allocation, and financial reporting. During 2021, we launched multiple systems, including a re-platform of our loyalty program and the introduction of our social commerce interface. In addition, we continued to enhance and upgrade our online experience through both the web and our mobile app. We believe these systems and enhancements will continue to increase our ability to acquire and retain customers and ultimately accelerate our transformation from a store in the mall to a brand with a purpose powered by a styling community.

SOURCING

Our Sourcing Methods
We utilize a broad base of manufacturers located throughout the world that we believe produce goods at the level of quality that our customers desire and can supply products to us on a timely basis at competitive prices. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and, as a result, contract with third-party vendors for the production of all of our merchandise. We purchase both apparel and accessories through buying agents and directly from vendors. In exchange for a commission, our buying agents identify suitable vendors and coordinate our purchasing requirements with vendors by placing orders for merchandise on our behalf, facilitating the timely delivery of goods 
EXPRESS, INC. | 2021 Form 10-K | 7


to us, obtaining samples of merchandise produced in factories, inspecting finished merchandise, and carrying out vendor compliance monitoring and administrative communications on our behalf.
We purchase the majority of our merchandise outside of the United States through arrangements with approximately 70 vendors utilizing approximately 270 manufacturing facilities located in approximately 20 countries throughout the world, primarily in Asia. The top five countries from which we sourced our merchandise in 2021 were Vietnam, China, Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines, based on total cost of merchandise purchased. The top 10 manufacturing facilities, based on cost, supplied approximately 29% of our merchandise in 2021. We purchase merchandise using purchase orders, and therefore are not subject to long-term production contracts with any vendors, manufacturers, or buying agents.
Quality Assurance and Compliance Monitoring
Each supplier, factory, and subcontractor that manufactures our merchandise is required to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct and certain other purchasing terms and conditions, including those related to product quality. This is designed to ensure that each of our suppliers' operations are conducted in a legal, ethical, and responsible manner. Our Code of Vendor Conduct requires that each of our suppliers provides minimum wages and benefits, limits working hours, complies with all laws, including environmental laws, and provides a safe and healthy work environment. It also forbids the use of child labor or forced labor, and prohibits unauthorized subcontracting. We monitor compliance through third parties who conduct regular factory audits on our behalf as well as through our buying agents.

DISTRIBUTION

We utilize two facilities for the distribution of our product, both of which are owned and operated by third parties. Virtually all of the merchandise sold in our stores and on our website is first received and processed at a central distribution facility in Columbus, Ohio. From there, merchandise allocated to be sold in stores is shipped to our stores and merchandise to be sold online direct-to-consumer is shipped to a distribution facility in Richwood, Kentucky (the "Richwood Facility"). Merchandise is typically shipped to such stores and to the Richwood Facility via third-party delivery services multiple times per week, thereby providing them with a steady flow of inventory. The third party who operates the Richwood Facility is responsible for fulfilling the majority of the orders placed through our website and shipping the merchandise directly to customers or to stores for pickup, via third-party delivery services. In addition, approximately 323 retail stores have the ability to ship select online merchandise directly to our customers.

In addition, we own domain names for many of our trademarks, including express.com, and we vigorously protect them against infringement.

REGULATION AND LEGISLATION

We are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations, including minimum wage requirements; intellectual property laws; consumer protection laws and regulations, including those governing advertising and promotions, privacy, and product safety; laws and regulations with respect to the operation of our stores and business generally,

including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and laws that apply as a result of being a public company. In addition, we are subject to United States customs laws and similar laws of other countries associated with the import and export of merchandise.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES

At Express our brand purpose is to create confidence and inspire self-expression, and our associates are essential to fulfilling that purpose. In order to compete and succeed in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, we must continue to attract and retain talented and experienced employees. To do this, we begin with a comprehensive, Company-wide program called Success@Express that guides our approach to associate performance, potential and succession, and rewards. Success@Express also ensures that each associate’s goals and objectives are aligned with the EXPRESSway Forward strategy.
Associates
We currently employ approximately 10,000 associates. Approximately 800 associates are based at our corporate locations in either Columbus or New York City, approximately 40 are field-based regional and district managers, approximately 1,000 are in-store managers and assistant managers, and approximately 8,000 are in-store sales associates. Approximately 30% of our associates are full-time and the remaining 70% are part-time. We employ temporary, seasonal associates at times, primarily during peak holiday selling periods. None of our associates are represented by a union. We believe our relations with our associates are good. 
Compensation and Benefits
The compensation and benefits component of the Success@Express program is designed to attract and reward individuals who demonstrate the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our shareholders. We provide associates with compensation packages that include base salary and may also include annual incentive bonuses and/or long-term incentive awards depending upon the associate’s level. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns associate and stockholder interests. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer eligible associates benefits such as life and health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, and a 401(k) plan, of which we match 4.0% of contributions.
We offer Flex@Express which empowers associates to work with their leaders to create flexible work arrangements that best balance their personal and professional commitments.
Board Oversight
Human capital management is incorporated into discussions of our Board of Directors throughout the year. The Compensation and Governance Committee reviews our corporate responsibility program, and any related policies and practices, at least annually and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding plans and progress against key initiatives. Generally, we consider our commitment to corporate and social responsibility to include, among other things, respect for human rights, ethical and sustainable sourcing, environmental and climate change initiatives, evaluating the impact of our practices on the communities in which we operate and our associates, and charitable giving.

SEASONALITY

Our business is seasonal. We define our seasons as Spring, which includes the first and second quarters, and Fall, which includes the third and fourth quarters. Historically, we have realized a higher portion of our net sales and net income in the Fall season due primarily to the impact of the holiday season. Generally, approximately 45% of our annual net sales occur in the Spring season and 55% occur in the Fall season. Cash needs are typically higher in the third quarter due to inventory-related working capital requirements for early Fall and holiday selling periods. Our business is also subject, at certain times, to calendar shifts, which may occur during key selling periods close to holidays such as Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
