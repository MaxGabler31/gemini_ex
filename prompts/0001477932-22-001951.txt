Status of Production

Each of our 5 products discussed below have been completed the following stages:


· | We have concluded our initial marketing analysis, including an analysis of our competition and development of marketing strategies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | We have concluded our research and development, including making a raw materials selection, making products formulations, concluding lab testing, and concluding quality assurance and quality control studies.
· | We have concluded the parts of production, including the production process, producing technology optimization, selection equipment for production; selecting sources of raw materials supplies. 


Material hurdles remain until we can sell the products commercially. First, we must construct manufacturing facilities, which includes locating a site, installing a workshop and setting up equipment. No special equipment needs to be engineered or produced. All needed equipment is presently available from existing manufacturers. Second, our workforce will need to be trained, however, no specialized education or experience is needed by labor we intend to hire.

Category I Polypeptide Freeze-dried Powder

1. JI MAI—Bovine Cardiac Vascular Active Peptide

Figure 1 – packaging design for Ji Mai Cardiac Vascular Active Peptide

The vascular endothelial cells exist vascular wall of bovine have a complex enzyme system, which can synthesize and secrete a variety of bioactive substances, as well as tissue fibrinogen and prostacyclin, endothelin (which has a strong vasoconstrictive effect, also known as endothelium contraction factor), and vascular skin cell relaxation factor which has vasodilated effect.

Bovine cardiac vascular active peptide is a protein peptide of vascular homology (amino acid type and its sequence) which made from healthy and fresh bovine cardiac vascular tissues as raw materials. It is made in a closed environment at low temperature using medical freeze-dried equipment and is processed through biological enzymolysis, enzyme digestion, separation, purification, ultrafiltration and other extraction process to structural polypeptide in a freeze-dried powder form. The molecular weight of the product is optimized via bioengineering for easy absorption by humans. There is no pigment, preservatives and other artificial additives in the product, and is suitable for all kinds of physical conditions of people to use.

Biocompatibility (amino acid sequence and structure convergence of peptides) refers to the good matching degree between basic protein peptides and host cells and tissues. Whether it is the skeleton of new tissue before being absorbed, or it is absorbed and assimilated into the host to become a part of the host, it has good compatibility with the matrix of similar tissue, and becomes a part of the normal physiological function of cells and tissues.

2. Double Proline AG – 3D Active Collagen Peptide

DPAG - Drinkable Cosmetics

Figure 2 - packaging design for 3D Active Collagen Peptide

There is a substance in human body called cathepsin K, which is slowly degrading collagen content of tissue while ageing. It will result that active collagen is gradually reduced and lost. The appearance of the body is the loss of elasticity, relaxation and relaxation of the body. The interior of the body is the decrease of the cell quantity and the collapse of the tissue.

Sea cucumber, deer tendon, eel, fish maw, donkey skin all have significant common characteristics – gelatinous consistencies, which contains higher proline, hydroxyproline, arginine and glycine. In mammals, ox tendon has the highest content of collagen.

80% of the human skin made by collagen; the molecular weight of collagen in glial food is 300000 daltons. The molecular size of the gliadin food is too large, it is very difficult for human digestive enzymes to decompose it, and its digestion and absorption rate is very limited.

By using healthy and fresh bovine or ox tendon as raw materials, our DPAG product is made in a closed environment at low temperature using medical freeze-dried equipment and was processed through biological enzymolysis, enzyme digestion, separation, purification, ultrafiltration and other extraction process to structural polypeptide in a freeze-dried powder form. The molecular weight of the product is 1920da and is optimized via the bioengineering technical for easy absorption by humans. There is no pigment, preservatives and other artificial additives in the product.

Our DPAG product is designed to be an easily absorbed bioactive collagen.

3. Cartilage Peptide -- Type II collagen peptide
Figure 3 - packaging design for Cartilage Peptide -- Type II collagen peptide

In recent years, there are many collagen (peptide) products on the market, but they are basically raw materials for collagen production. Most of them come from fish skin and other raw materials.

Type II collagen peptide is prepared from Bovine or Pig Cartilage bones by hot water extraction, and then it is enzymolyzed by neutral protease, protamex, acidic protease and pepsin, through purification, ultrafiltration and other extraction process to structural polypeptide in a freeze-dried powder form peptide with molecular weight of 8000 daltons.

It mainly composed of type II collagen peptide from cartilage and bone; it has a higher content of bio calcium with collagen peptides acting as a dietary supplement.

Se Plus utilizes the stabilizing properties of the 21st amino acids and strong antioxidants as its primary makeup.

Ingredients:


· | L-Se-Methylselenocysteine (MSC)
--+--------------------------------
· | High Selenium Yeast 


L-Se-Methylselenocysteine (MSC) is a naturally occurring organoselenium compound found in many plants, including garlic, onions, and broccoli, with potential antioxidant and chemopreventive activities. Se-Methyl-seleno-L-cysteine (MSC) is an amino acid analogue of cysteine in which a methylselenium moiety replaces the sulphur atom of cysteine. This agent acts as an antioxidant when incorporated into glutathione peroxidase and has been shown to exhibit potent chemopreventive activity in animal models.

Se Plus Target Audience:


· | Middle-aged and elderly individuals. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Individuals exposed to excessive pollution, such as atmospheric, food, or water pollution.
· | Individuals who are selenium deficient due to various reasons. 

2. Sugar Master
Figure 5 - packaging design for Sugar Master

Our Sugar Master product is made utilizing low temperature extraction techniques to maximize the harvest of bio-actives of plant matter, which is optimized by our processing formula to ensure the best absorption as a dietary supplement.
Main Active Ingredients Include:


· | Natural herbal polypeptides, extracted using cryogenic techniques to ensure molecular activity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Concentrated and purified natural plant extracts; and 
· | High efficiency organic selenium complex. 


Two major components of bitter melon, namely charantin and momordicoside, may be destroyed during the process of extraction if high temperatures are used (60 C for 24 hours by heat drying). These components should therefore be extracted safely at low temperatures (5 C for 24 hours by freeze-drying or lyophilization).
