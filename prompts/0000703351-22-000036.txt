Restaurant Brands
Chili’s Grill & Bar
Chili’s is a recognized leader in the casual dining industry and the flagship brand of Dallas-based Brinker International, Inc. Chili’s has been operating restaurants for over 47 years and enjoys a global presence with restaurants in the United States, 28 countries and two United States territories. Whether domestic or international, Company-owned or franchised, Chili’s is dedicated to delivering fresh and high-quality food with value-centric offerings such as 3 for Me, as well as dining experiences that make guests feel special.
Historically, the menu featured bold, kicked-up American favorites and Chili’s has built a reputation for big mouth burgers, full-on sizzling fajitas, baby back ribs and hand-shaken margaritas. In recent years, our culinary innovations have focused on these core food offerings. We believe our shift in focusing on a few core equities on our menu, our fun laid-back Chilihead culture, and our strong hospitality standards that prioritize making our guests feel special have allowed Chili’s to differentiate its high-quality food and service from other casual dining restaurants.
In addition, Chili’s has focused on a seamless digital experience as our guests’ preferences and expectations around dining convenience have evolved in recent years. Investments in our technology and off-premise options have enabled us to provide a faster, more convenient dine-in experience and to offer more To-Go and delivery options for our guests. Our To-Go menu is now available through the Chili’s mobile app, chilis.com, our delivery partners DoorDash, Uber Eats and Grubhub, Google Food Ordering or by calling the restaurant directly. 
In dining rooms, we use tabletop devices to engage our guests at the table. These devices provide functionality for guests to pay at the table, order or re-order, engage in digital entertainment, provide guest feedback and interact with our My Chili’s Rewards program. Our My Chili’s Rewards® program offers free chips and salsa or a non-alcoholic beverage to members based on their visit frequency. We customize offerings for our guests based on their purchase behavior.
In fiscal 2022, entrée selections at our Company-owned restaurants ranged in menu price from $8.00 to $21.63. Our average annual net sales per Company-owned Chili’s restaurant during fiscal 2022 was $3.2 million, and the average revenue per meal, including alcoholic beverages, was approximately $16.37 per guest. Food and non-alcoholic beverage sales accounted for 89.8% and 90.7% of Chili’s Company sales in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, with alcoholic beverage sales accounting for the remainder.
Maggiano’s Little Italy
Maggiano’s is a full-service, national, polished casual restaurant brand offering Italian-American cuisine. With a passion for making people feel special, the brand is known for catering to special occasions and large parties. Each Maggiano’s location is uniquely designed and features open dining rooms with fresh flowers, warm carpets and soft lighting. Most locations feature designated banquet facilities and all offer catering for large parties at homes or local businesses. Our full carryout menu is also available for pick up or delivered through third-party delivery providers. Each Maggiano’s has an executive chef preparing authentic recipes from scratch ingredients. Dishes are served in abundant portions both à la carte and family style. We offer a full range of lunch and dinner options, complimented by a premium wine list and handcrafted cocktails.
In fiscal 2022, entrée selections ranged in menu price from $8.99 to $42.99. Our average annual sales per Maggiano’s restaurant in fiscal 2022 was $8.1 million, and the average revenue per meal, including alcoholic beverages, was approximately $29.40 per guest. Sales from events at our banquet facilities made up 12.5% and 4.8% of Maggiano’s Company sales in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Food and non-alcoholic beverage sales accounted for 87.0% and 89.2% of Maggiano’s Company sales for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, with alcoholic beverage sales accounting for the remainder.
Virtual Brands
We have invested in virtual brands, restaurant-like menu offerings that are only available for purchase digitally, to drive restaurant traffic and sales growth. Our virtual brands have enabled us to capitalize on the growth in off-premise dining and to leverage excess kitchen capacity in our existing restaurant infrastructure, while adding minimal complexity in our restaurants’ kitchens. 
It’s Just Wings, launched on June 23, 2020, and is a no-frills offering that consists of chicken wings available in a variety of different sauces and rubs, curly fries, ranch dressing and hand pies for a value price. Maggiano’s Italian Classics offers a select group of items inspired by the menu at Maggiano’s Little Italy, including several appetizers, salads, pastas, entrées and hand pies.
These brands are available for purchase through our third-party service providers including DoorDash, Google Food Ordering, Uber Eats, as well as the brand specific websites, itsjustwings.com and maggianosclassics.com. The operating results for virtual brands are included in the results of our Chili’s and Maggiano’s brands, based on the restaurants that prepared and processed the food orders.
Business Strategy
We are committed to strategies and a Company culture that we believe will improve guest traffic, grow sales and profits, and engage team members. Our strategies and culture are intended to differentiate our brands from the competition and to focus on the guest experience. We are effectively and efficiently managing our restaurants to establish a lasting presence for our brands in key markets around the world.
Our primary strategy is to make our guests feel special through great food and quality service so that they return to our restaurants. We differentiate Chili’s from our competitors with a flexible platform of value offerings at both lunch and dinner and are committed to offering consistent, quality products at a price point that is compelling to our guests. We discontinued the 3 for $10.99 platform and replaced it with 3 for Me, a flexible value bundle providing guests an unbeatable everyday value, while allowing us to be more flexible in terms of pricing, in light of the inflationary challenges. Guests can order customized meals inclusive of a non-alcoholic drink, appetizer and entrée starting at just $10.99. The bundle can be augmented with a premium appetizer, dessert, or alcoholic beverage, each for just $2.49 extra. Additionally, we have continued our Margarita of the Month promotion that features a premium-liquor margarita every month at an every-day value price. Most of our value propositions are available for guests to enjoy in our dining rooms or off-premise.
We have also invested in our technology and off-premise options as more guests are opting for To-Go and delivery. From the beginning of fiscal 2020 to the end of fiscal 2022, Chili’s off-premise business has grown by 51%. Chili’s partnership with DoorDash was instrumental in offering our guests continued service during the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal 2022, we expanded partnerships with third-party delivery companies, and by the end of the year Chili’s, Maggiano’s, and It’s Just Wings brands were available on DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Grubhub. Orders to these third-party delivery companies are sent directly into our point-of-sale system, creating efficiencies and a system that allows us to better serve our guests. In addition, Maggiano’s Italian Classics is now available to order through DoorDash and Uber Eats at over 800 Chili’s restaurants. We believe that guests will continue to prefer more convenience and off-premise options. We plan to continue investments in our technology systems to support our To-Go and delivery capabilities.
Company Development
During fiscal 2022, we continued the expansion of our restaurant brands domestically through new Company-owned restaurants in strategically desirable markets. We concentrate on the development of certain identified markets that are most likely to improve our competitive position and achieve the desired level of marketing potential, profitability and return on invested capital. Our domestic expansion efforts focus not only on major metropolitan areas in the United States but also on smaller market areas and partnerships with franchisees to enter non-traditional locations (such as airports and universities) that can adequately support our restaurant brands. For smaller market areas, we have developed a smaller Chili’s building prototype that allows us to expand into these markets and serve our guests while maintaining a focus on profitability and return on invested capital.
The restaurant site selection process is critical, and we devote significant effort to the investigation of new locations utilizing a variety of sophisticated analytical techniques. Members of each brand’s executive team inspect, review and approve each restaurant site prior to its leasing or acquisition for that brand. Our process evaluates a variety of factors, including:
•Trade area demographics, such as target population density and household income levels;
•Physical site characteristics, such as visibility, accessibility and traffic volume;
•Relative proximity to activity centers, such as shopping centers, hotel and entertainment complexes and office buildings; and
•Supply and demand trends, such as proposed infrastructure improvements, new developments and existing and potential competition.
The specific rate at which we are able to open new restaurants is determined, in part, by our success in locating satisfactory sites, negotiating acceptable lease or purchase terms, securing appropriate local governmental permits and approvals, and by our capacity to supervise construction and team member recruitment and training. The temporary shutdown of development activities during the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the 2022 opening count. However, in fiscal 2023, we will resume development activities at a higher scale. The following table illustrates the Company-owned restaurants opened during fiscal 2022 and the projected openings for fiscal 2023. The fiscal 2023 projected openings remain subject to change:

 | Fiscal 2022 | Fiscal 2023 
 | Fiscal Year Openings | Projected Openings
Company-owned restaurants | | 
Chili’s domestic | 5 | | 18
Chili’s international | — | | — 
Maggiano’s domestic | — | | — 
Total Company-owned new openings | 5 | | 18
Company-owned relocations | | 
Chili’s domestic | — | | 1 

We periodically re-evaluate Company-owned restaurant sites to monitor that their attributes have not deteriorated below our minimum standards. In the event site deterioration occurs, each brand makes a concerted effort to improve the restaurant’s performance by providing physical, operating, and marketing enhancements unique to each restaurant’s situation. In some cases, the brand considers relocation to a proximate, more desirable site, or evaluates closing the restaurant if the brand’s measurement criteria, such as cash flow and area demographic trends, do not support relocation.
During fiscal 2022, excluding temporary closures, we permanently closed six Company-owned Chili’s restaurants that were performing below our standards and were near or at the expiration of their lease terms. Our strategic plan is targeted to support our long-term growth objectives, with a focus on continued development of those restaurant locations that have the greatest return potential for the Company and our shareholders.
Franchise Development
We also pursue expansion through the development of our franchisees. The following table illustrates the franchise-operated restaurants opened during fiscal 2022 and the projected openings for fiscal 2023. The fiscal 2023 projected openings remain subject to change based on the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic:

 | Fiscal 2022 | Fiscal 2023 
 | Fiscal Year Openings | Projected Openings
Franchise-operated restaurants | | 
Chili’s domestic | 2 | | 1-3 
Chili’s international | 12 | | 16-20
Maggiano’s domestic | — | | — 
Total openings | 14 | | 17-23

The following table illustrates the percentages of franchise-operated restaurants out of the total Company-owned and franchise-operated restaurants as of June 29, 2022, by restaurant brand:

 | Percentage of Franchise-Operated Restaurants
 | Domestic(1) | | International(2) | | Overall(3)
Brinker | 8 | % | | 99 | % | 28 | %
Chili’s | 8 | % | | 99 | % | 29 | %
Maggiano’s | 4 | % | | — | % | 4 | %

(1)Domestic franchise-operated restaurants as a percentage of total domestic restaurants.
(2)International franchise-operated restaurants as a percentage of total international restaurants.
(3)Franchise-operated restaurants (domestic and international) as a percentage of total system-wide restaurants.
International Franchises
Our international growth is driven by development agreements with new and existing franchise partners. This growth introduces Chili’s to new countries and expands the brand within our existing markets. As of June 29, 2022, we have 15 active development arrangements. During fiscal 2022, we opened 12 new locations, and entered into two new arrangements, both with existing franchise partners. We plan to strategically pursue expansion of Chili’s internationally in areas where we see the most growth opportunities. Our international agreements provide for development fees and initial franchise fee revenues in addition to subsequent royalty fee revenues based on the gross sales of each restaurant. We expect future agreements to remain limited to enterprises that demonstrate a proven track record as a restaurant operator and showcase financial strength that can support a multi-unit development agreement.
Domestic Franchises
As of June 29, 2022, no domestic development arrangement existed, however, certain of our domestic partners have opened new domestic franchised locations. Similar to our international agreements, a typical domestic franchise agreement provides for initial franchise fees revenues in addition to subsequent royalty and advertising fee revenues based on the gross sales of each restaurant. We have from time to time purchased restaurants from our franchisees in order to support our growth objectives in certain markets. In fiscal 2022, we purchased 68 Chili’s restaurants from three former franchisees located in the Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes and Northwest regions of the United States. We believe these acquisitions represent an opportunity to create value for our shareholders and to generate additional earnings and cash flow growth. We remain committed to supporting the growth of our existing franchisees. 
Restaurant Management
Our Chili’s and Maggiano’s brands have separate designated teams who support each brand, including operations, finance, franchise, marketing, human resources and culinary. We believe these strategic, brand-focused teams foster the identities of the individual and uniquely positioned brands. To maximize efficiencies, brands continue to utilize common and shared infrastructure, including, among other services, accounting, information technology, purchasing, guest relations, legal, and restaurant development.
At the restaurant level, management structure varies by brand. A typical restaurant is led by a management team including a general managing partner, two additional managers and certified shift leaders and for Maggiano’s, an executive chef partner with an additional two to three chefs. The level of restaurant supervision depends upon the operating complexity and sales volume of individual locations. We believe there is a high correlation between the quality of restaurant management and the long-term success of a brand. In that regard, we encourage longer tenure at all management positions through various short and long-term incentive programs, which may include equity ownership. These programs, coupled with a general management philosophy emphasizing quality of life, have enabled us to attract and retain key team members.
We strive to ensure consistent quality standards in our brands through the issuance of operational manuals covering all elements of operations and food and beverage manuals, which provide guidance for preparation of brand-formulated recipes. Routine restaurant visits by all levels of management from our President and CEO and Chili’s Leadership Team to our Vice Presidents of Operations and Directors of Operations enforce strict adherence to our overall brand standards and operating procedures and also create an opportunity to capture and act on feedback so we continue to improve. Each brand is responsible for maintaining their operational training program. Depending on the brand, the training program typically includes a training period of two to three months for restaurant management trainees, as well as special training for high-potential team members and managers. We also provide recurring management training for managers and supervisors to improve effectiveness or prepare them for more responsibility.
Supply Chain and Quality Assurance
Our ability to maintain consistent quality and continuity of supply throughout each restaurant brand depends upon acquiring products from reliable sources. Our approved suppliers and our restaurants are required to adhere to strict product and safety specifications established through our quality assurance and culinary programs. These requirements are intended to ensure high-quality products are served in each of our restaurants. We strategically negotiate directly with major suppliers to obtain competitive prices. We also use purchase commitment contracts when appropriate to stabilize the potentially volatile pricing associated with certain commodity items. All essential products are available from pre-qualified distributors to be delivered to our restaurant brands. Although we have not experienced significant supply chain disruptions since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced limited product shortages in our supply chain.
Additionally, as a purchaser of a variety of food products, we require our suppliers to adhere to our supplier code of conduct, which sets forth our expectation of business integrity, food safety and food ingredients, animal welfare and sustainability. Due to the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products and inventories in the restaurants, which consist primarily of food, beverages and supplies, our inventories have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to revenues. Internationally, our franchisees may encounter cultural and regulatory differences resulting in variances with product specifications for international restaurant locations. 
Advertising and Marketing
Chili’s primary focus for developing menu innovation and targeting our digital advertising and loyalty program direct promotions are the Generation X and Millennial families who desire quality food, good value and a service experience that allows them to connect with family and friends. These young families represent a significant percentage of our guest base today and, we believe, will only grow in importance in the years ahead. We rely on digital marketing, direct marketing, social media and word of mouth to advertise. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our off-premise sales increased, and we have shifted our advertising spend to focus on these sales channels accordingly.
Our domestic Chili’s franchise agreements generally require advertising contributions to us by the franchisees. We use these contributions, in conjunction with Company funds, for the purpose of retaining advertising agencies, obtaining consumer insights, developing and producing brand-specific creative materials and purchasing national or regional media to meet the brand’s strategies. Some franchisees also spend additional amounts on local advertising. Any such local advertising is required to be approved by us.
Maggiano’s, as a “polished casual” restaurant with 54 Company-owned and franchise-operated locations, primarily targets guests from affluent households who live and work around the higher-end malls where the majority of Maggiano’s restaurants are located. Maggiano’s relies on digital marketing, direct marketing, social media and word of mouth to advertise.
Seasonality
Our business has historically been seasonal and experienced fluctuation in sales volume during the fiscal year. The highest sales are generally observed during the winter and the spring months, whereas the summer and the fall months are accompanied with lower sales. Moreover, factors such as inclement weather conditions, natural disasters, and timing of holidays tend to impact this seasonality by region.
Human Capital Management
Our employee base, as of June 29, 2022, consisted of 62,025 team members. These included 556 restaurant support center team members and 4,920 restaurant managers and above restaurant leaders, with the remainder being hourly team members. Of our hourly team members, approximately 28% are full-time and 72% are part-time employees. As of June 29, 2022, approximately 52% of our employees are women and approximately 55% of our employees (who self-identified as a race or ethnicity) are racially or ethnically diverse. Our team members are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements. Our executive officers have an average of more than 23 years of experience in the restaurant industry.
Culture and Wellbeing
For decades, our culture has been built on our passion for making people feel special, and that starts with our team members. We affectionately call them Brinkerheads, Chiliheads or Maggiano’s Teammates, and we know that when they feel their best, they provide great food and service to our guests. Our motto is “Life is Short, Work Happy” and we promote and nurture a corporate culture that promotes wellbeing, inclusion and growth. We believe that hiring, training, mentoring and supporting team members is the key to retention and living our culture.
We strive to help our team members turn their restaurant jobs into lasting careers. These career paths are made possible by a number of development programs, including the Certified Shift Leader (“CSL”) program at Chili’s, which is accredited as an apprenticeship through the National Restaurant Association Education Foundation and United States Department of Labor. Our CSL program gives hourly team members a clear path into management by providing knowledge, training and skills to become successful restaurant managers. In fiscal 2022, approximately 628 team members from the CSL program were promoted into management. We also provide separate development programs for new managers, managers preparing to become general managers and general managers preparing to become directors of operations. Approximately 73% of our new general managers are promoted from our existing team members.
Our no-cost education program, Best You EDU™, provides foundational learning, ESL, citizenship preparation courses, GED, associate degree programs and other educational benefits, such as Spanish and standard tuition reimbursement. This program is available for all team members with a minimum of 45 days of tenure and at least 15 hours of work per week. 
Brinker cares about the health and wellbeing of all team members and provides resources and opportunities to help team members be their best, while at work and at home with their family, with our Be Well program. This program focuses on five areas of wellbeing: career, social, financial, physical/emotional and community. In addition to our career development programs discussed above, we provide resources and opportunities to raise millions of dollars 
annually for charitable causes, and we provide annual fitness reimbursements for salaried team members and free mental health counselling for those enrolled in our benefit plans.
We believe that every team member should feel valued and respected and know that their work is meaningful and makes a difference in our brands and our communities. We ask all of our team members to take a survey semi-annually, which includes meaningful feedback on how our team members feel about their overall work experience, their manager and our culture. Our executive management team reviews the results of these surveys with our Board of Directors and strives to incorporate this feedback into future strategies.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DE&I”)
Our restaurants are built on the foundation of a culture of inclusion. Our team members are diverse in gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, religion, age, cultural background and life experiences. We celebrate the differences that make us stronger. We are committed to a workplace environment where every team member feels that they belong and where every team member can succeed. Our Board of Directors through its committees provides oversight for aspects of our culture equity and inclusion. We are working to strengthen the foundation of our culture of inclusion and to build greater diverse leadership at Brinker through the following programs and initiatives:
•Journey Groups – Opportunities for team members to connect with other team members interested in taking steps on their personal journey to learn and discuss anti-racism, allyship and equality in a safe space focused on a supporting book, video, podcast, etc.
•Women Taking the Lead – Development, mentoring and resources to help professionally develop female leaders
•Leaders Leading Through Diversity – A development program to increase diverse representation among restaurant operations leadership
•DE&I Training – Online learning paths on topics such as conscious and unconscious bias, as well as additional mandatory training programs for certain operations leaders
•Communities of Interest – Five resource groups providing safe spaces for underrepresented groups and allies to develop connections, share ideas and encourage diversity of thought in the organization
•Culture of Inclusion Series – Events to help educate team members about inclusion and different cultures
•TM Highlights – Opportunities for team members to share their personal stories, experiences, and what inclusion and allyship means to them
•Serving it Forward – allows us to go out and support, learn and impact communities to help create a better more-inclusive tomorrow partnering with non-profits that align with our giveback pillars of education, kids and hunger
COVID-19 Team Member Support
When faced with an unprecedented pandemic, our team members stepped up to the challenge and demonstrated strength, resilience and commitment. Brinker stepped up to focus on the health and safety of our team members and guests and to provide significant financial support. Our efforts included the following, some of which includes efforts from fiscal 2020 when the pandemic began:
•Safety – We immediately implemented enhanced cleaning and disinfecting procedures
•Team Member Relief Fund – We paid approximately $15.7 million to help 41,920 hourly team members who had reduced or no working hours as a result of government mandated dining room closures
•Health Screening and PPE – At shift check-in, all team members completed health screens, and we provided all our team members with face coverings which they were required to wear
•Training – Team members completed COVID-19 specific training and at shift check-in, managers regularly gave reviews of policies and practices
•Additional Funds – We paid hourly team members in certain circumstances for missed shifts due to a COVID-19 diagnosis, being in quarantine or living with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, and reimbursed for some out-of-pocket medical expenses incurred as a result of COVID-19
•Benefits – We provided free mental health services for all team members and their families, and all team members enrolled in benefits were able to keep their benefits at the same discounted premium even if they were furloughed or no longer worked full-time
Information Technology and Cybersecurity
We pride ourselves on being innovators in our field, striving to create and procure cutting edge technology to improve the guest experience and create operational efficiencies. We have created and implemented technologies to facilitate a contactless guest experience through apps, tabletop and handheld devices and QR code payment. Our restaurant operators utilize our back office systems for inventory control, curbside management, forecasting, demand preparation and productivity. Our service desk supports the needs of both our restaurant support center and each of our restaurants. Our data centers are geographically dispersed, which helps support continuity of our operations and systems. Our systems operate in multiple cloud environments, which gives us ability to scale up infrastructure and provides flexibility for expansion. They are comprised of a combination of internally developed and third-party developed software; our team builds foundational frameworks to integrate and bridge technologies. We believe our information systems are sufficient to support our business and we continually seek to improve our processes based on the strategic and financial priorities of the business.
Information and data security is a priority for us, and we are consistently reviewing and evaluating risks and requirements to keep the data we have secure. Our existing cyber security policy includes continuous monitoring and detection programs, network security precautions, encryption of critical data, in depth security assessment of vendors and incident response guidelines. We continue to invest and innovate around the areas of protection of systems, sensitive data, technology and processes using third-party and in-house tools and resources. We remain vigilant in staying ahead of new and emerging risks utilizing our tools and security teams and continue to review and make strategic continued investments in our systems to keep the Company, our guests and our team members data secure.
We subscribe to multiple feeds and associations that discuss and monitor risks of any technology compromise or risks at our business partners where relevant. Relevant restaurant level personnel and employees at the restaurant support center receive annual training on information security best practices. Additionally, we provide annual credit card handling training following Payment Card Industry guidelines to team members that handle guest payment information. We maintain a disaster recovery plan and protect against business interruption by backing up our major systems. In addition, we periodically scan our environment for any vulnerability, perform penetration testing and engage third parties to assess effectiveness of our data security practices. A third-party conducts regular network security reviews, scans and audits.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for our data security practices and we believe the committee has the requisite skills and visibility into the design and operation of our data security practices, to fulfill this responsibility effectively. Management reporting on the effectiveness of these practices is provided to the Board of Directors, including the Audit Committee, on a quarterly basis or as needed.
