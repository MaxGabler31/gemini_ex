Item 1. Business.
General Development of Business
 
We were incorporated on November 18, 2020 under the laws of the State of Wyoming.
 
We intend to complete the development of and operate a ride-hailing and food delivery computer and mobile device application known as “WarpSpeedTaxi”. A ride-hailing service, also known as app-taxi, e-taxi, or a mobility service provider, is a service that, via websites and mobile apps, matches passengers with drivers of vehicles for hire that are not licensed taxi drivers. The computer application that we are developing is intended to provide travelers with convenient door-to-door transport that leverages smart mobility platforms to connect drivers with passengers and lets drivers use their personal vehicles. Ride-hailing, like a traditional taxi service, facilitates drivers providing rides to customers for a fee. However, ride-hailing offers additional capabilities, such as efficient pricing tools, matching platforms, rating systems, and food delivery.
 
We originally entered into an agreement dated December 20, 2020 to acquire the WarpSpeedTaxi application in its current phase of development from Limitless Projects Inc. (“Limitless”), a Wyoming corporation for total consideration of $300,000 payable in stages. However, on January 19, 2022, we entered into an agreement whereby we terminated our asset purchase and sale agreement given our inability to make a required payments pursuant to that agreement.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the termination agreement, Limitless reimbursed us the $10,000 cash payment that we made to Limitless upon the execution of the original agreement. Additionally, our directors at that time, who are also the directors of our parent company, Cyber Apps World, Inc. (“Cyber Apps”), resigned and appointed Daniel Okelo, the president of Limitless, in their place. Cyber Apps has also transferred the 115,000,000 shares of common stock in our capital that it owns to Limitless for consideration of $14,100. As a result of the termination agreement, we own the WarpSpeed Taxi application and Limitless is now our largest shareholder. We are currently in the beta testing phase of the WarpSpeed Taxi application.
 
We anticipate that our WarpSpeedTaxi application will allow customers to hire a standard and luxury motor vehicles via a smartphone or personal computer for both one-way and round-trips with the price based on the distance travelled and the current level of demand for vehicles. In addition to transporting passengers, the application may also be used for deliveries of goods from restaurants, grocery stores, and other businesses that typically utilize local vehicle courier services.
 
Customers will use the application to request a ride or the delivery of goods. Drivers that we recruit and approve, through confirmation of no criminal record, a clean driving history, and access to a suitable insured vehicle, will act as independent contractors and set their own work hours. They will connect with customers via our application, pick up customers or goods to be delivered in accordance with the customer’s request, and then drive the customers or goods to their destination. Customers will pay for the transportation through the application by way of credit card. Drivers will receive payments for each ride or delivery they complete via a weekly direct deposit to their bank accounts.

When a customer uses the WarpSpeedTaxi application for ride-hailing, we will charge the customer a flat fee of approximately $2.00 for each ride plus an amount for each mile that the customer travels. The amount for each mile will vary depending on the city in which the customer is located. It will be higher in more densely populated cities where traffic moves relatively slowly and lower in less densely population cities will less traffic congestion. Additionally, we will charge customers an additional premium during busy times when customer demand exceeds the number of available drivers. This increase in pricing is intended to incentivize drivers to work during peak demand times since they will receive greater compensation. In order to encourage drivers to work as independent contractors for us, we will initially retain 15% of all revenue that a customer pays for a ride with the remaining 85% compensating the driver for his or her time and vehicle expenses. Drivers will also retain 100% of all tips that customers provide them. Over time, when we have established a market for our services, we may adjust this percentage so that we retain a greater percentage of revenue.
 
When a restaurant uses the food delivery service feature of our WarpSpeedTaxi application, we will charge restaurants between 5% and 15% of their order revenue, subject to a set minimum amount, depending on the amount of business that we receive from delivery orders of their food through our application. From these proceeds, we will pay our drivers a base fee for deliveries that depend on the distance that they must travel to pick up the food and deliver it to the customer. In addition, the driver will retain any tips that the customer provides.
 
United States Joint Venture
 
On March 15, 2022, we entered into an agreement with a United States-based joint venture partner (the “JV Partner”) whereby we will form a U.S. corporation (the “Corporation”) for the purpose of operating a ride-hailing and delivery business using our WarpSpeed Taxi computer application (the “Application”). The agreement provided that we will be responsible for licensing the Application to the Company and making any modifications to the Application that are necessary in order to customize it for operation in U.S. markets. The JV Partner will be responsible for operating the Company’s business, including, retaining all employees and independent contractors necessary to commence and continue business operations, handling customer service queries, complying with all applicable regulations and legal requirements, and handling all legal and accounting matters. We will have a 51% equity interest in the Corporation and our JV Partner will have a 49% interest. We will also receive an application licensing fee equal to 2.5% of all gross revenues that the Corporation generates, as well as a monthly fee (i.e., the greater of $5,000 or 2.5% of each month’s sales) payable on the Corporation’s commencement of revenue-generating operations.
 
On July 7, 2022, we amended our agreement with the JV Partner to extend two payment deadlines by three months each. As a result of the amendment, the JV Partner must pay $1,000,000 (i.e., $20,000 upon execution of the agreement (paid), an additional $250,000 by October 31, 2022, and the balance by January 31, 2023).
 
The agreement contemplates that the Corporation shall initially commence operations in Nevada and subsequently expand its business to other United States cities in all 50 states.
 
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
 
The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to impact our ability to conduct our business as planned. Our ability to successfully develop our business is subject to uncertainties surrounding the duration and severity of the pandemic, including the efficacy and availability of vaccines, the effectiveness of vaccines on limiting or eliminating the spread of the COVID-19 virus including current virus variants and those that may emerge in the future.
 
While the demand for food delivery services has increased since the beginning of the pandemic, the demand for ride hailing has decreased. Two of the largest competitors in the sector, Uber and Lyft, have reported that their ridership has dropped by between 70% and 80% during the pandemic and have suffered large losses as a result despite the increase in food delivery services. We cannot predict whether these trends will continue and what impact they may have on our ability to generate revenue and eventually enjoy profitable operations.

The continued prevalence of COVID-19 nationally and globally could have an adverse impact on our business, operations, and financial results. The related disruptions that we may experience include a decrease in demand for ride hailing services due to customers wanting to avoid potential exposure to our drivers, increased unwillingness of drivers to risk interacting with customers in the confined environment of motor vehicles, restrictions on our drivers’ ability to access certain areas due to imposed restrictions, and restrictions that we must impose on drivers and customers in order to ensure their safety.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic could also adversely affect our liquidity and ability to access the capital markets. Uncertainty regarding the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial results will also depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and different COVID variants, the implementation or recurrence of shelter in place or similar orders in the future, its impact on the financial markets in which we operate, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus, and the related impact on consumer travel and demand for delivery services. This uncertainty could increase the likelihood that our business fails.
 
Market Opportunity
 
According to Statista (2020), the global ride hailing and taxi market is projected to reach almost $260 billion in 2021 with 1.47 billion registered users, with an expected annual growth of 18.8% from 2020 to 2025, resulting in a projected market value of about $386 billion by 2025. User penetration is 19.3% in 2020 and is expected to hit 20.8% by 2025.
 
A number of factors contribute to driving the growth of the ride-hailing market:
 
Increasing Smartphone and Internet Penetration: As ride sharing is an internet-enabled service, internet connectivity is the basic requirement for availing ride sharing services in any part of the world. The users are required to download an application on their smartphone and use data services to access the app and other navigation and information services related to it. Internet connectivity is also needed for navigation, telematics, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication. According to the International Telecommunication Union, approximately 81% of the population in developed countries uses the internet. On the other hand, 40% of individuals in developing countries have access to the internet through that rate is increasing rapidly.
 
On-demand transportation services: On-demand transportation services are characterized by flexible routing and ad-hoc scheduling of private vehicles offering personal transport experiences to the general public by picking up or dropping off passengers or goods at locations of the customer’s choice. On-demand ride-hailing services ensure that customers can accurately locate the vehicles, track their journey, and offer safety to the occupants. The proliferation of such services across countries is expected to significantly drive market growth.
 
Increase in Cost of Vehicle Ownership: The cost of owning a personal vehicle has increased with rising fuel prices over time and an increase in finance, insurance, and vehicle registration costs. Maintenance costs, which include the repair of parts and accessories and labor charges, have also increased and added to the overall cost of vehicle ownership. Also, with the introduction of strict emission norms, vehicles need better, advanced, and costly after treatment devices. These factors have increased the cost of vehicle ownership, which in turn has increased the popularity of ride sharing services.
 
Lower rate of car ownership among millennials: Due to vehicle ownership costs and personal preferences, the rate of vehicle ownership among millennials and subsequent generations reaching the legal driving age is low compared to older generations. The millennials are choosing practical, smartphone accessible transport options that are simple, flexible, and comparatively inexpensive. Thus, it is anticipated that successive generations that reach the legal driving age will opt for ride hailing options given their assessment of costs and their relative familiarity with using smartphone-based applications.
 
We plan to commence our ride-hailing operations in the United States. Due to a large number of market vendors based in the U.S., the country hosts most of the major innovators and investors in the sector. The United States is one of the early adopters of the business model, which provides consumer familiarity with the services we intend to offer. North America accounted for a global ride-hailing market share of more than 35% in terms of revenue in 2018. This is attributed to the fact that most ride-hailing companies operating in the industry were incorporated in U.S. High demand for public transportation in cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Seattle, is contributing to market growth.

The overall size of the ride hailing and ride sharing market in North America is growing with 36% of U.S. adults using the service in 2018 compared to 15% in 2015. According to Accenture, nearly two-thirds (63%) of the US car owners who use ride-hailing services say that they would consider giving up their vehicles over the next decade in favor of ride-hailing. Based on a survey of more than 1,000 US consumers, Accenture found that consumer satisfaction with ride-hailing companies is very high, at 92%, and that the vast majority (93%) of the respondents expect to maintain or increase their spending on ride-hailing services. Ride-hailing usage has increased across most demographic groups, but adoption figures continue to vary by age, educational attainment, and income level. For example, roughly half of Americans ages 18 to 29 (51%) say they have used a ride-hailing service, compared with 24% of those ages 50 and older. Those whose annual household income is $75,000 or more are roughly twice as likely as those earning less than $30,000 to have used these services. Subject to the successful launch of our WarpSpeedTaxi app in the United States, we intend to expand our operations to other markets, including Europe, Canada, and Australia.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
Because we generated less than $1 billion in total annual gross revenues during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (“JOBS”) Act.
 
We will lose our emerging growth company status on the earliest occurrence of any of the following events:
 
1. on the last day of any fiscal year in which we earn at least $1 billion in total annual gross revenues, which amount is adjusted for inflation every five years;
 
2. on the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement;
 
3. on the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or
 
4. the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a ‘large accelerated filer’, as defined in section 240.12b–2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto.
 
A “large accelerated filer” is an issuer that, at the end of its fiscal year, meets the following conditions:
 
1. it has an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of the issuer’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter;
 
2. It has been subject to the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act for a period of at least twelve calendar months; and
 
3. It has filed at least one annual report pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act.
 
As an emerging growth company, exemptions from the following provisions are available to us:
 
1. Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires auditor attestation of internal controls;
 
2. Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation;
 
3. Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies to disclose the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the company;

4. Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies to disclose the ratio between the annual total compensation of the CEO and the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the companies; and
 
5. The requirement to provide certain other executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K. Instead, an emerging growth company must only comply with the more limited provisions of Item 402 applicable to smaller reporting companies, regardless of the issuer’s size.
 
Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company may choose to forgo such exemption and instead comply with the requirements that apply to an issuer that is not an emerging growth company. We have elected under this section of the JOBS Act to maintain our status as an emerging growth company and take advantage of the JOBS Act provisions relating to complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act.
 
Competition
 
There is intense competition between traditional taxi companies and ride-hailing services. Companies providing ride-hailing services are transitioning from providing traditional taxi services to additional services, such as ride sharing and food and consumer goods delivery, in order to expand the overall market for transportation services.
 
The ride-hailing market is quite fragmented as there is high competition in the market among major players. Since this market is expanding, new entrants are emerging as well. We will compete with other ride-hailing companies, including Uber, Lyft, Door Dash, and Grubhub that are well-established in North America. In other markets where we may wish to expand, there are also well-established regional companies, such as DiDi (China), Ola (India), Grab (southeast Asia), Bolt (Europe, Africa, and the Middle East), and Cabify (South America). These companies generally have greater financial and technical resources, industry expertise, and managerial capabilities than we do. Most of our competitors benefit from established brand awareness with current and prospective customers.
 
We believe that industry competition for customers is primarily based on brand recognition, marketing, price, and quality of service. We hope to be able to compete effectively based on these factors though we primarily hope to develop a niche market by providing lower commission charges to restaurants that agree to utilize our food delivery services and by developing underexplored markets, such as businesses that use local courier services for non-food deliveries and rely on traditional vehicle courier companies.
 
Compliance with Government Regulations
 
We will be subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. These laws, regulations, and standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, environmental protection, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, consumer protection and warnings, marketing, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application and website accessibility, money transmittal, and background checks. The sale and delivery of goods through our platform is also subject to laws, regulations, and standards that govern food safety, alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, hazardous substances, and the interstate and intrastate transport of goods. These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies.
 
Other proposed changes to laws and regulations related to our industry include a proposed rule under consideration by the New York State Liquor Authority that would limit fees that can be charged by food delivery facilitation services and proposed legislation in California and other states that would require third-party grocery services to maintain minimum liability insurance.

We will also be subject to general business regulations and laws as well as federal and state regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the Internet, e-commerce or other online services, and increase the cost of providing online services. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. Unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business and results of operations.
 
We anticipate that a significant amount of our operations will be conducted in India due to relative low labor costs. There are no governmental regulations specifically relating to services that we intend to provide within India. Foreign corporations, such as us, are authorized to conduct business in India; however, they are required to comply with domestic business laws and regulations, including those relating to occupational health and safety, and minimum wage requirements. We do not anticipate that these regulations will have a significant adverse impact on our operations or cause us to incur significant expenses related to compliance.
