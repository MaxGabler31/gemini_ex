Item 1. Business
Overview
 BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BioMarin, we, us or our) is a global biotechnology company that develops and commercializes innovative therapies for people with serious and life-threatening rare diseases and medical conditions. We select product candidates for diseases and conditions that represent a significant unmet medical need, have well-understood biology and provide an opportunity to be first-to-market or offer a significant benefit over existing products.
 Our therapy portfolio consists of six commercial products and multiple clinical and pre-clinical product candidates. Our commercial products are Aldurazyme (laronidase) for Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I), Brineura (cerliponase alfa) for the treatment of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), Firdapse (amifampridine phosphate) for Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride) for phenylketonuria (PKU), Naglazyme (galsulfase) for Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI) and Vimizim (elosulfase alpha) for Mucopolysaccharidosis IV Type A (MPS IV A).  
 We continue to invest in our clinical and pre-clinical product pipeline by committing significant resources to research and development programs and business development opportunities within our areas of scientific, manufacturing and technical expertise. We are conducting clinical trials on several product candidates for the treatment of various diseases. Our major product candidates in development include pegvaliase, an enzyme substitution therapy for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU); vosoritide, a peptide therapeutic for the treatment of achondroplasia, the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans; valoctocogene roxaparvovec (formerly referred to as BMN 270), an AAV5 vector and factor VIII gene therapy drug development candidate, for the treatment of severe hemophilia A; BMN 250, an investigational enzyme replacement therapy using a novel fusion of recombinant human alpha-N-acetyglucosaminidase (NAGLU) with a peptide derived from insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), for the treatment of Sanfilippo Syndrome Type B, or mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB); and BMN 290, a selective chromatin modulation therapy, for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia. We are conducting or planning to conduct preclinical development of several other product candidates for genetic and other metabolic diseases.
 Recent Developments 
 FDA Regulatory Review of Pegvaliase
 On December 22, 2017, we announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will require additional time to complete its review of our Biologics License Application (BLA) for pegvaliase, a PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonialyase enzyme product to reduce blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adult patients with PKU who have uncontrolled blood Phe levels on existing management. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date for pegvaliase has been extended by three months to May 28, 2018, which was changed to May 25, 2018 due to the Memorial Day holiday.
Gene Therapy Product Candidate Valoctocogene Roxaparvovec for the Treatment of Hemophilia A
 On December 19, 2017, we announced that we had dosed the first patient in the global GENEr8-1 Phase 3 study with the 6e13 vg/kg dose for valoctocogene roxaparvovec, an investigational gene therapy for the treatment of patients with severe hemophilia A. This is the first of two Phase 3 studies in the global Phase 3 program to dose a patient. The global Phase 3 program includes two studies with valoctocogene roxaparvovec, one with the 6e13 vg/kg dose (GENEr8-1) and one with the 4e13 vg/kg dose (GENEr8-2). Both Phase 3 GENEr8 studies will be open-label single-arm studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of valoctocogene roxaparvovec. We plan to enroll the first patient in GENEr8-2 in early 2018. The primary endpoint in both studies will be based on the factor VIII activity level achieved following treatment with valoctocogene roxaparvovec, and the secondary endpoints will measure annualized factor VIII replacement therapy use rate and annualized bleed rate. We also plan to conduct a Phase 1/2 Study with the 6e13kg/vg dose and with approximately 10 patients who are AAV5 positive. The first patient is expected to enroll in the first half of 2018.
 On December 9, 2017, we announced an update to our previously reported results of an open-label Phase 1/2 study of valoctocogene roxaparvovec. The updated results were presented during an oral presentation at the 
 3

59th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition by John Pasi, M.B. Ch.B., Ph.D. from Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry and primary investigator for the Phase 1/2 study and included the presentation of data, which included sustained normal or near-normal factor VIII levels in severe hemophilia A for most patients with a maximum follow-up of 19 months. The data presented at ASH had a cut off of November 16, 2017 and included 78 weeks of data for the 6e13 vg/kg dose and 48 weeks of data for the 4e13 vg/kg dose. 
 In October 2017 we announced that valoctocogene roxaparvovec had been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA. The designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines to treat a serious disease and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies. Earlier in the year, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted access to its Priority Medicines (PRIME) regulatory initiative for valoctocogene roxaparvovec. To be accepted for PRIME, an investigational therapy has to show its potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs based on early clinical data. 
 Sale of Priority Review Voucher
 In December 2017, we sold a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher to Novartis Pharma AG for a lump sum payment of $125.0 million. We received the voucher under an FDA program intended to encourage the development of treatments for rare pediatric diseases. We were awarded the voucher in April 2017 when we received approval from the FDA of Brineura for the treatment of CLN2. 
 Selection of BMN 290 for Friedreich’s Ataxia
 In October 2017 we announced that we had selected BMN 290, a selective chromatin modulation therapy intended for treatment of Friedreich's ataxia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder that results in disabling neurologic and cardiac progressive decline. We expect to submit to the FDA an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the second half of 2018. 
 Product Candidate Vosoritide for the Treatment of Achondroplasia 
 In October 2017, we provided an update on the open-label Phase 2 study of vosoritide, an analog of C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP), in children with achondroplasia, the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans. Vosoritide for achondroplasia has demonstrated sustained increase in average growth velocity over 30 months of treatment in 10 children, who completed 30 months of daily dosing at 15 µg/kg/day. Over this period of time, patients have experienced mean absolute growth increase of approximately 4 cm over what their baseline growth velocity would have predicted. The sustained increase in annualized growth velocity was accompanied by sustained improvements over time in height compared to age- and gender-matched unaffected children as measured by z-scores. In addition, treatment with vosoritide shows continued improvement over time in proportionality as measured by a ratio of the upper and lower body measurements, or U/L ratio.
 4

Our global Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled study of vosoritide in approximately 110 children with achondroplasia ages 5-14 for 52 weeks also continued in 2017. The study will be followed by a subsequent open-label extension. Children in this study will have completed a minimum six-month baseline study to determine their respective baseline growth velocity prior to entering the Phase 3 study. Vosoritide is being tested in children in the age range where their growth plates are still open. This is approximately 25% of people with achondroplasia. We expect to complete enrollment of the Phase 3 study in mid-2018 and provide top-line data in the second half of 2019.

Major Commercial Products 
 Aldurazyme 
 Aldurazyme is approved for marketing in the United States (U.S.), the EU and other international markets for patients with MPS I. MPS I is a progressive and debilitating life-threatening genetic disease, for which no other drug treatment currently exists, that is caused by the deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase, a lysosomal enzyme normally required for the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Patients with MPS I typically become progressively worse and experience multiple severe and debilitating symptoms resulting from the build-up of carbohydrate residues in all tissues in the body. These symptoms include: inhibited growth, delayed and regressed mental development (in the severe form of the disease), enlarged liver and spleen, joint deformities and reduced range of motion, impaired cardiovascular function, upper airway obstruction, reduced pulmonary function, frequent ear and lung infections, impaired hearing and vision, sleep apnea, malaise and reduced endurance.
 We developed Aldurazyme through collaboration with Genzyme, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanofi. Under our collaboration agreement with Genzyme, we are responsible for manufacturing Aldurazyme and supplying it to Genzyme. We receive payments ranging from 39.5% to 50% on worldwide net Aldurazyme sales by Genzyme depending on sales volume. We recognize a portion of this amount as product transfer revenue when the product is shipped and released to Genzyme because all of our performance obligations are fulfilled at that point and title to, and risk of loss for, the product has transferred to Genzyme. The product transfer revenue represents the fixed amount per unit of Aldurazyme that Genzyme is required to pay us if the product is unsold by Genzyme. The amount of product transfer revenue will eventually be deducted from the revenues earned by us calculated based on Genzyme’s net sales recognized when the product is sold by Genzyme. Additionally, Genzyme and we are members of BioMarin/Genzyme LLC, a 50/50 limited liability company (the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC) that: (1) holds the intellectual property relating to Aldurazyme and other collaboration products and licenses all such intellectual property on a royalty-free basis to us and Genzyme to allow us to exercise our rights and perform our obligations under the agreements related to the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC, and (2) engages in research and development activities that are mutually selected and funded by Genzyme and us
 Aldurazyme net product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 totaled $90.0 million, $93.8 million and $98.0 million, respectively. On January 1, 2018, we will adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended (commonly referred to as ASC Topic 606). ASC Topic 606 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. After adopting ASC Topic 606, we will recognize Aldurazyme revenues when the product is shipped to Genzyme and all required quality control certificates are complete, because all of our performance obligations are fulfilled at that point in time. We will record Aldurazyme net product revenues based on the estimated tiered payment that will be in effect when the product is sold through by Genzyme. We believe that any differences between estimated revenues from Genzyme and the actual payments will be insignificant. See Note 4 to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
 Brineura
 Brineura is a recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 for the treatment of patients with CLN2, a form of Batten disease. CLN2 is an incurable, rapidly progressive disease that ends in patient death by 10-12 years of age. Patients are initially healthy but begin to decline at approximately the age of three. We estimate that up to 1,200 to 1,600 cases exist worldwide. On April 27, 2017, Brineura was approved in the U.S. to slow the progression of loss of ambulation in symptomatic pediatric patients three years of age and older with CLN2. Brineura is the first treatment approved to slow the progression of loss of ambulation in children with CLN2 disease. We began shipping the product in the U.S. in June 2017. 
 On June 1, 2017, we announced that the European Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for Brineura in the EU to treat children with CLN2 disease. Brineura is the first treatment approved in the EU for the treatment of CLN2 disease, and the marketing authorization for Brineura includes all 28 countries of the EU, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. On April 21, 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the scientific committee of the EMA adopted a positive opinion for our MAA for Brineura following an accelerated review procedure, reserved for medicinal products expected to be a major public health interest. Brineura is one of the first therapies to go through this process. We began shipping the product in the EU in July 2017.  
 Brineura is administered via intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion and intended to be used in combination with a delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. Please see “Government Regulation – Combination Products” below for additional information on combination products.

Brineura net product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $8.6 million.
 Kuvan 
 Kuvan is a proprietary synthetic oral form of 6R-BH4, a naturally occurring enzyme co-factor for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), indicated for patients with PKU. Kuvan is the first drug for the treatment of PKU, which is an inherited metabolic disease that affects at least 50,000 diagnosed patients under the age of 40 in the developed world. We believe that approximately 30% to 50% of those with PKU could benefit from treatment with Kuvan. PKU is caused by a deficiency of activity of an enzyme, PAH, which is required for the metabolism of Phe. Phe is an essential amino acid found in all protein-containing foods. Without sufficient quantity or activity of PAH, Phe accumulates to abnormally high levels in the blood, resulting in a variety of serious neurological complications, including severe mental retardation and brain damage, mental illness, seizures and other cognitive problems. As a result of newborn screening efforts implemented in the 1960s and early 1970s, virtually all PKU patients under the age of 40 in developed countries have been diagnosed at birth. Currently, PKU can be managed by a Phe-restricted diet, which is supplemented by nutritional replacement products, like formulas and specially manufactured foods; however, it is difficult for most patients to adhere to the strict diet to the extent needed for achieving adequate control of blood Phe levels. 
 Kuvan tablets were granted marketing approval for the treatment of PKU in the U.S. in December 2007 and in the EU in December 2008. In December 2013, the FDA approved the use of Kuvan powder for oral solution that is provided in a dose sachet packet allowing faster dissolution of powder in solution compared to the current tablet form. We commenced the commercial launch of this new form of Kuvan in February 2014. We market Kuvan in the U.S., the EU and other international markets (excluding Japan). In certain international markets, Kuvan is also approved for, or is only approved for, the treatment of primary BH4 deficiency, a different disorder than PKU. Kuvan net product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 totaled $407.5 million, $348.0 million and $239.3 million, respectively. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into the Termination and Transition Agreement with Ares Trading S.A. (Merck Serono), as amended and restated on December 23, 2015 (the A&R Kuvan Agreement) to terminate the Development, License and Commercialization Agreement, dated May 13, 2005, as amended (the License Agreement), including the license to Kuvan granted in the License Agreement from us to Merck Serono. Also in the fourth quarter of 2015, we and Merck Serono entered into a Termination Agreement (the Pegvaliase Agreement) to terminate the license to pegvaliase granted in the License Agreement from us to Merck Serono. 
 On January 1, 2016, pursuant to the A&R Kuvan Agreement and the Pegvaliase Agreement, we completed the acquisition from Merck Serono and its affiliates of certain rights and other assets, and the assumption from Merck Serono and its affiliates of certain liabilities, in each case with respect to Kuvan and pegvaliase. As a result, we acquired all global rights to Kuvan and pegvaliase from Merck Serono, with the exception of Kuvan in Japan. Previously, we had exclusive rights to Kuvan in the U.S. and Canada and pegvaliase in the U.S. and Japan.
 Pursuant to the A&R Kuvan Agreement, we paid Merck Serono $374.5 million, in cash, and are obligated to pay Merck Serono up to a maximum of €60.0 million, in cash, if future sales milestones are met. Pursuant to the Pegvaliase Agreement, we are obligated to pay Merck Serono up to a maximum of €125.0 million, in cash, if future development milestones are met. 
 Two companies previously filed paragraph IV certifications and submitted abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) to produce sapropterin dihydrochloride tablets and powder. We entered into settlement agreements regarding Kuvan with both companies. Please see “Government Regulation – Hatch-Waxman Act” below and “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Please see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks posed by generic versions of Kuvan.
 Naglazyme 
 Naglazyme is a recombinant form of N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase (arylsulfatase B) indicated for patients with MPS VI. MPS VI is a debilitating life-threatening genetic disease for which no other drug treatment currently exists and is caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase B, an enzyme normally required for the breakdown of certain complex carbohydrates known as GAGs. Patients with MPS VI typically become progressively worse and experience multiple severe and debilitating symptoms resulting from the build-up of carbohydrate residues in tissues in the body. These symptoms include: inhibited growth, spinal cord 
 7

compression, enlarged liver and spleen, joint deformities and reduced range of motion, skeletal deformities, impaired cardiovascular function, upper airway obstruction, reduced pulmonary function, frequent ear and lung infections, impaired hearing and vision, sleep apnea, malaise and reduced endurance.
 Naglazyme is approved for marketing in the U.S., the EU and other international markets. Naglazyme net product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $332.2 million, $296.5 million and $303.1 million, respectively. 
 Vimizim 
 Vimizim is an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of MPS IV A, a lysosomal storage disorder. MPS IV A is a disease characterized by deficient activity of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS) causing excessive lysosomal storage of glycosaminoglycans such as keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. This excessive storage causes a systemic skeletal dysplasia, short stature, and joint abnormalities, which limit mobility and endurance. Malformation of the chest impairs respiratory function, and looseness of joints in the neck cause spinal instability and potentially spinal cord compression. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, corneal clouding, and heart disease. Initial symptoms often become evident in the first five years of life. The disease substantially limits both the quality and length of life of those affected. We have identified over 2,000 patients worldwide suffering from MPS IV A and estimate that the total number of patients suffering from MPS IV A worldwide could be as many as 3,000.
 Vimizim was granted marketing approval in the U.S. and the EU in February 2014 and April 2014, respectively, and subsequently in several other international markets. Vimizim net product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $413.3 million, $354.1 million and $228.1 million, respectively.
 Major Product Candidates in Development 
 Pegvaliase 
 Pegvaliase is an investigational enzyme substitution therapy that we are developing as a subcutaneous injection for the treatment of PKU. In March 2016, we announced that our pivotal Phase 3 PRISM-2 study for pegvaliase met the primary endpoint of change in blood Phe compared with placebo (p<0.0001). This ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial includes an open-label study to evaluate safety and blood Phe levels in naïve patients and a randomized controlled study of the Phase 2 extension study patients and patients from the open-label trial to evaluate blood Phe levels and neurocognitive endpoints. Although we met the primary endpoint of the Phase 3 PRISM-2 study, we did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in inattention or mood scores, a key secondary clinical neurocognitive endpoint. The FDA has indicated that lowering Phe blood levels in adults could form the basis for an accelerated approval; however, a favorable outcome on prospectively-specified analyses of inattention in patients with baseline problems with attention may be required for full approval. Although the FDA accepted for Priority Review our BLA for pegvaliase in August 2017, there is no assurance that a reduction in blood Phe alone will be sufficient to support the FDA’s full regulatory approval of pegvaliase. On September 14, 2017, we announced that the FDA provided us with the "Day-74" filing communication for our BLA for pegvaliase. In the letter, the FDA advised that it was not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. When the FDA accepted our BLA and granted priority review status, we announced that the FDA had requested additional information on Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC), which was likely to be classified as a major amendment to the BLA and result in a three month extension of the PDUFA date. As expected, the FDA designated the receipt of this additional information as a major amendment to the application thus extending the PDUFA target action date by three months to May 28, 2018, which was changed to May 25, 2018 due to the Memorial Day holiday. If we receive approval from the FDA for pegvaliase on the PDUFA target action date, we could potentially launch the sale of pegvaliase in the U.S. in the second half of 2018. We plan to submit a MAA to the EMA in the first quarter of 2018. 
Valoctocogene Roxaparvovec
 Valoctocogene roxaparvovec is an AAV5 vector drug development candidate designed to restore factor VIII plasma concentrations in patients with severe hemophilia A. Hemophilia A, also called factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia, is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor VIII, a clotting protein. According to the World Federation of Hemophilia rankings of severity of hemophilia A, the normal range of factor VIII activity levels is between 50% and 150%, expressed as a percentage of normal factor activity in blood, the mild hemophilia A range of factor VIII activity levels is between 5% and 40%, the moderate hemophilia A range 
 8

of factor VIII activity levels is between 1% and 5%, and the severe hemophilia range of factor VIII activity levels is less than 1%. People living with hemophilia A are not able to form blood clots efficiently and are at risk for excessive bleeding from modest injuries, potentially endangering their lives. People with severe hemophilia often bleed spontaneously into their muscles or joints.  
 In July 2016, we announced positive proof-of-concept data from a Phase 1/2 dose-escalation study for valoctocogene roxaparvovec in patients with severe hemophilia A, and we subsequently provided positive updates to our interim results in January and July 2017. In December 2017, further updates on valoctocogene roxaparvovec were presented during an oral presentation at the 59th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition by John Pasi, M.B., Ch.B., Ph.D., from Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry and primary investigator for this Phase 1/2 study. The data presented at ASH had a cut off of November 16, 2017 and included the following updates: For the 4e13 vg/kg dose, the three patients with the longest follow-up (at week 48) had factor VIII activity levels that were in or near the normal range with both median and mean values of 49%. Median annualized bleed and factor VIII use rates for the 4e13 vg/kg cohort were zero after week 4 and when their factor VIII activity rose above 5%. Mean annualized bleed and factor VIII use rates for the 4e13vg/kg cohort were 0.6 and 2.0, respectively. For the 6e13 vg/kg dose, at 78 weeks post infusion, the median and mean factor VIII levels for patients were 90 and 89%, respectively. Median annualized bleed and factor VIII use rates for the 6e13 vg/kg cohort were zero after week 4. Mean annualized bleed and factor VIII use rates for the 6e13 vg/kg cohort were 0.5 and 6.1, respectively. Patients in the Phase 1/2 study will be monitored for safety for five years.
 On December 19, 2017, we announced that we had dosed the first patient in the global GENEr8-1 Phase 3 study with the 6e13 vg/kg dose for valoctocogene roxaparvovec. This is the first of two Phase 3 studies in the global Phase 3 program to dose a first patient. The global Phase 3 program includes two studies with valoctocogene roxaparvovec, one with the 6e13 vg/kg dose (GENEr8-1) and one with the 4e13 vg/kg dose (GENEr8-2). Both Phase 3 GENEr8 studies will be open-label single-arm studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of valoctocogene roxaparvovec. We plan to enroll the first patient in GENEr8-2 in early 2018. The primary endpoint in both studies will be based on the factor VIII activity level achieved following valoctocogene roxaparvovec, and the secondary endpoints will measure annualized factor VIII replacement therapy use rate and annualized bleed rate. Additionally, we plan to begin another Phase 1/2 Study with the 6e13kg/vg dose with approximately 10 patients who are AAV5 positive. The first patient is expected to enroll in the first half of 2018.
 As further described above under “Recent Developments,” the FDA granted valoctocogene roxaparvovec Breakthrough Therapy Designation, and the EMA granted access to its PRIME regulatory initiative for valoctocogene roxaparvovec.
 Vosoritide 
 Vosoritide is a peptide therapeutic in development for the treatment of achondroplasia, the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans. In April 2016, we reported 12-month data for the patients in the 15 µg/kg/day cohort of the Phase 2 open-label, sequential cohort, dose-escalation study of vosoritide in children who are 5-14 years old, which showed a durable and consistent increase in mean annualized growth velocity of 46%-65% from baseline in the group. Vosoritide continued to be well tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation. In October 2017, we provided an update on the Phase 2 study of vosoritide, which demonstrated sustained increase in average growth velocity over 30 months of treatment in 10 children that completed 30 months of daily dosing at 15 µg/kg/day. Over this period of time, patients experienced mean absolute growth increase of approximately 4 cm over what their baseline growth velocity would have predicted. The sustained increase in annualized growth velocity was accompanied by sustained improvements over time in height compared to age- and gender-matched unaffected children as measured by z-scores. In addition, treatment with vosoritide showed continued improvement over time in proportionality as measured by the U/L ratio.   
 Our global Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled study of vosoritide in approximately 110 children with achondroplasia ages 5-14 for 52 weeks also continued in 2017. The study will be followed by a subsequent open-label extension. Children in this study will have completed a minimum six-month baseline study to determine their respective baseline growth velocity prior to entering the Phase 3 study. Vosoritide is being tested in children in the age range where their growth plates are still open. This is approximately 25% of people with achondroplasia. We expect to complete enrollment of the Phase 3 study in mid-2018 and provide top-line data in the second half of 2019. Additionally, we intend to begin an infant/toddler study in 2018 in children with achondroplasia ages 0-5. We have undertaken a natural history program to augment our clinical understanding of outcomes of untreated patients for comparison to patients treated with vosoritide.

 BMN 250 is an investigational enzyme replacement therapy using a novel fusion NAGLU with a peptide derived from IGF2 for the treatment of MPS IIIB. MPS IIIB is a rapidly progressive pediatric brain disease caused by NAGLU enzyme deficiency resulting in accumulation of heparan sulfate (HS) in the brain. The accumulation of HS leads to progressive cognitive decline, loss of developmental milestones, severe hyperactivity, sleep disorders, loss of mobility, and early death. BMN 250 is delivered directly into the central nervous system via an ICV access device into the cerebrospinal fluid, which allows for the drug to bypass the blood brain barrier and distribute directly within the brain. In January 2017, we announced positive, preliminary results from a multicenter, international Phase 1/2 clinical trial for BMN 250, which began enrolling patients in April 2016. The study demonstrated that BMN 250 reduced HS levels to normal range in cerebral spinal fluid of MPS IIIB patients. A complementary observational study was also initiated to study the progression of MPS IIIB over time. 
 In February 2018, we presented interim data from the Phase 1/2 trial for BMN 250 at WORLDSymposium 2018. In the completed dose escalation portion of the study (Part 1), which was designed to determine safety and pharmacodynamics activity of BMN 250, three patients received escalating weekly doses (30mg, 100mg, 300mg) of BMN 250 over nine to twelve months. In Part 2 of the study, patients roll over from Part 1 and from the 250-901 observational study; dosing is 300 mg weekly. This interim data cut included the three patients from the dose escalation study and three patients from Part 2. Eligible patients from the concurrently-running 250-901 observational study are expected to roll over into Part 2 on an ongoing basis. MPS IIIB patients are missing one of four enzymes required for HS degradation, resulting in HS elevations. Cerebrospinal fluid HS levels, which were markedly elevated at baseline, were reduced to the non-affected or normal range in all six patients at the time of the data cut. All patients in the 250-901 observational study have enlarged livers as assessed by abdominal MRI scans. All three BMN 250-treated Part 1 patients experienced decreases in liver size into the normal range for age; data for the first three rollover patients is pending. Untreated MPS IIIB patients in the 250-901 observational study show progressive declines over time in developmental quotient (DQ), a measure of cognitive function normalized to age. In contrast, preliminary data in all three Part 1 patients suggest DQ stabilization. Further data in these patients and in patients who roll into the treatment study is necessary to confirm this early observation. Interim trial data indicates that ICV-administered BMN 250 is well-tolerated by MPS IIIB patients, and that the adverse event profile for BMN 250 is generally consistent with that seen with other enzyme replacement therapies and the ICV mode of administration.
 BMN 290 
 BMN 290 is a selective chromatin modulation therapy for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia. Friedreich's ataxia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, which results in disabling neurologic and cardiac progressive decline. Currently there are no approved disease modifying therapies for Friedreich's ataxia. In preclinical models, BMN 290 increases frataxin expression in affected tissues more than two-fold. BMN 290 is a second-generation compound derived from a compound we acquired from Repligen Corporation (Repligen) that had human clinical data demonstrating increases in frataxin in Friedreich’s ataxia patients. We selected BMN 290 for its favorable penetration into the central nervous system and cardiac target tissues and its preservation of the selectivity of the original Repligen compound. We plan to submit an IND in the second half of 2018.
Manufacturing 
 We manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) for Aldurazyme, Brineura, Naglazyme, Vimizim, pegvaliase, and vosoritide in our production facilities located in Novato, California. These facilities have demonstrated compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EC and health agencies in other countries for the commercial production of Aldurazyme, Naglazyme, Brineura, and Vimizim. Vialing and most packaging are performed by contract manufacturers. We believe that we have ample manufacturing capacity to support commercial demand for both Aldurazyme and Naglazyme for at least the next five years. 
 We currently manufacture the API for Brineura, Vimizim and BMN 250 in our manufacturing facility in Shanbally, Cork, Ireland. This facility has been approved by the FDA, Health Product Regulatory Authorities, EMA, EC, and health agencies in other countries for the testing, packaging, labeling, and release of Vimizim. In June 2017, the FDA approved the Shanbally facility as a bulk biologics manufacturing plant for Vimizim production, which enhances our business continuity and increases our operating capacity to support the anticipated commercial demand of Vimizim. In November and December 2017, the FDA and the EMA, respectively, approved the Shanbally facility as a formulated bulk drug substance manufacturing and quality control facility for Brineura, which further increases our operating capacity and supports the anticipated commercial demand for Brineura. Vialing and most packaging of Brineura, Vimizim and BMN 250 are performed 
 10

by contract manufacturers. We believe that with the Shanbally facility and our Novato, California facility, we have ample manufacturing capacity to support commercial demand for Brineura and Vimizim for at least the next five years. 
 Firdapse and Kuvan tablets and powder sachets are currently manufactured on a contract basis by third parties. In general, we expect to continue to contract with outside service providers for certain manufacturing services, including drug substance, API, final product vialing, tableting and sachet production and packaging operations for our products. All of our facilities and those of any third-party manufacturers will be subject to periodic inspections confirming compliance with applicable law and must pass inspection before we can manufacture our drugs for commercial sales. Third-party manufacturers’ facilities are subject to periodic inspections to confirm compliance with applicable law and must be cGMPs certified. We believe that our current agreements with third-party manufacturers and suppliers provide for ample operating capacity to support the anticipated clinical and commercial demand for these products. In certain instances, there is only one approved contract manufacturer for certain aspects of the manufacturing process. In such cases, we attempt to prevent disruption of supplies through supply agreements, maintaining safety stock and other appropriate strategies. Although we have never experienced a disruption in supply from our contract manufacturers, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience a disruption in the future.
 In July 2017, we commissioned our commercial gene therapy manufacturing facility, located in Novato, California, and began cGMP production of valoctocogene roxaparvovec to support clinical development activities and anticipated commercial demand. This facility is capable of supporting the manufacturing of product for approximately 2,000 patients per year, and the production process was developed in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use facilitating worldwide registration with health authorities.
 Raw Materials 
 Raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products and product candidates are available in some instances from one supplier and in other instances from multiple suppliers. In those cases where raw materials are only available through one supplier, such supplier may be either a sole source (the only recognized supply source available to us) or a single source (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We have adopted policies to attempt, to the extent feasible, to minimize our raw material supply risks, including maintenance of greater levels of raw materials inventory and implementation of multiple raw materials sourcing strategies, especially for critical raw materials. Although to date we have not experienced any significant delays in obtaining any raw materials from our suppliers, we cannot provide assurance that we will not face shortages from one or more of them in the future.
Sales and Marketing 
 We have established a commercial organization, including a sales force, to support our product lines directly in the U.S., Europe, South America and certain other significant markets. For other selected markets, we have signed agreements with other companies to act as distributors of Brineura, Kuvan, Naglazyme and Vimizim. Most of these agreements generally grant the distributor the right to market the product in the territory and the obligation to secure all necessary regulatory approvals for commercial or named patient sales. Additional markets are being assessed at this time and additional agreements may be signed in the future. 
 Genzyme has the exclusive right to distribute, market and sell Aldurazyme globally and is required to purchase its requirements exclusively from us. 
 In the U.S., our products (other than Aldurazyme) are marketed through our commercial teams, including sales representatives and supporting staff members, who promote our products, directly to physicians in specialties appropriate for each product. Outside of the U.S., our sales representatives and supporting staff members market our products (other than Aldurazyme). We believe that with moderate changes in 2018, the size of our sales force will be appropriate to effectively reach our target audience in markets where our products are directly marketed. The launch of any future products, including pegvaliase, will likely require expansion of our commercial organization, including our sales force, in the U.S. and abroad, and we would need to commit significant additional funds, management’s attention and other resources to such expansion. 
 We utilize third-party logistics companies to store and distribute our products. Moreover, we use third-party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and suppliers of marketing and other sales support-related services, to assist with our commercial activities.

Customers 
 Our Brineura, Firdapse, Kuvan, Naglazyme, and Vimizim customers include a limited number of specialty pharmacies and end-users, such as hospitals and foreign government agencies. We also sell Brineura, Kuvan, Naglazyme and Vimizim to our authorized distributors and to certain larger pharmaceutical wholesalers globally, which act as intermediaries between us and end-users and generally do not stock significant quantities of our products. However, in certain countries, such as those in Latin America, governments place large periodic orders for Naglazyme and Vimizim. The timing of these orders can be inconsistent and can create significant quarter to quarter variation in our revenue. During 2017, 45% of our net Brineura, Firdapse, Kuvan, Naglazyme, and Vimizim product revenues were generated by three customers. Genzyme is our sole customer for Aldurazyme and is responsible for marketing and selling Aldurazyme to third parties. 
Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Within the industry, there are many public and private companies, including pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that have or may soon initiate programs for the same indications that our candidate drugs and commercial drugs are intended to treat. Furthermore, universities and non-profit research organizations may have research programs, both early-stage and clinical, in the same disease areas. Our competitors may have advantages over us due to greater financial or scientific resources, lower labor and other costs, or due to higher headcount and more robust organizational structures. Our competitors have considerable experience in drug manufacturing, preclinical and clinical research, regulatory affairs, marketing, sales, and distribution. They pursue broad patent portfolios and other intellectual property to protect the products they are developing. Their products may outcompete ours due to one or more factors, including faster progress through preclinical and clinical development, lower manufacturing costs, superior safety and efficacy, lower pricing, stronger patent protection, and better marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities. In this event, our products, even if approved, could fail to gain significant market share, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
 Our products have no direct approved competition currently on the market, however, other companies are in the development phase with new and generic products. The following is a summary of some of the primary possible future competitors for our products, but the information below may not include all potential competition. 
 
Aldurazyme, Naglazyme, and Vimizim
 
In the mucopolysaccharidosis field, several companies are researching treatments using small molecules, gene therapy, and other novel technologies. Aldurazyme, for the treatment of MPS I, has potential competition from clinical stage product candidates from Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. and ArmaGen, Inc. and earlier stage product candidates, including product candidates from RegenxBio Inc., Immusoft Corporation, and Eloxx Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Naglazyme, for the treatment of MPS VI, has potential competition from a clinical stage product candidate from Inventiva S.A. and other potential candidates in earlier stages. These companies, however, are likely a year or more away from commercial therapies.  
Kuvan and Pegvaliase
 There are currently no other approved drugs for the treatment of PKU. However, two companies previously filed paragraph IV certifications and submitted ANDAs to produce sapropterin dihydrochloride tablets and powder. We entered into settlement agreements regarding Kuvan with both companies, which will allow these companies to market generic versions of sapropterin dihydrochloride. Please see “Government Regulation – Hatch-Waxman Act” below and “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
 
Brineura
 Brineura, for the treatment of CLN2, has potential competition from earlier stage products, including a preclinical gene therapy product candidate under development by Spark Therapeutics, Inc.
 
Product Candidates
 
Our product candidates have potential competition from product candidates either using similar technology to our programs or different treatment strategies. Valoctocogene roxaparvovec, for the treatment of hemophilia A, could have competition from marketed factor VIII replacement therapies, a novel bispecific antibody marketed 
 12

by Roche Holding Ltd, earlier stage programs, including a product candidates under development by Spark Therapeutics, Inc., Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc, and Shire Plc, and preclinical product candidates from other companies. In addition, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing a novel product candidate in the clinic for the treatment of hemophilia A. Vosoritide, for the treatment of achondroplasia, could have competition from early stage products under development by Ascendis Pharma A/S and Therachon AG. BMN 250, for the treatment of MPS IIIB, has potential competition from a clinical stage gene therapy program from Abeona Therapeutics Inc., preclinical gene therapy programs from Laboratorios del Dr. Esteve, S.A.U. and Orchard Therapeutics, Ltd. and other earlier stage product candidates, including a recombinant protein product candidate from ArmaGen. Inc. BMN 290, for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia, has potential competition from clinical stage product candidates from Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company and earlier stage product candidates from Agilis Biotherapeutics, Inc., Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., Pfizer Inc. and Chondrial Therapeutics Inc. 
 Patents and Proprietary Rights 
 Our success depends on an intellectual property portfolio that supports our future revenue streams and also erects barriers to our competitors. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio through: filing new patent applications; prosecuting existing applications; and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications. Furthermore we seek to protect our ownership of know-how, trade secrets and trademarks through an active program of legal mechanisms including registrations, assignments, confidentiality agreements, material transfer agreements, research collaborations and licenses. 
 As of January 19, 2018, the number of our worldwide issued patents now stands at 1,481, including 111 patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO). Furthermore, our portfolio of pending patent applications totals 478 applications, including 79 pending U.S. applications. 
 With respect to Naglazyme, we have 53 issued patents, including three U.S. patents. Claims cover our ultrapure N -acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase compositions of Naglazyme, methods of treating deficiencies of N -acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase, including MPS VI, methods of producing and purifying such ultrapure N -acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase compositions and methods of detecting. These patents will expire between 2021 and 2028. 
 With respect to Kuvan, we own, co-own or have licensed a number of patents and pending patent applications that relate generally to formulations and forms of our drug substance, methods of use for various indications under development and dosing regimens. We have rights to 151 issued patents including 16 issued U.S. patents with claims to a stable tablet and oral solution formulation of 6R-BH4, methods of treating PKU using a once daily dosing regimen, methods of administration of Kuvan with food, crystalline forms of 6R-BH4, and methods of producing 6R-BH4. These patents will expire between 2024 and 2032. 
 We have rights to 33 issued patents, including six U.S. patents, related to Aldurazyme. These patents cover our ultra-pure alpha-L-iduronidase composition of Aldurazyme, methods of treating deficiencies of alpha-L-iduronidase by administering pharmaceutical compositions comprising such ultra-pure alpha-L-iduronidase, a method of purifying such ultra-pure alpha-L-iduronidase and the use of compositions of ultra-pure biologically active fragments of alpha-L-iduronidase. These patents will expire in 2019 and 2020. There are U.S. patents on alpha-L-iduronidase owned and controlled by a third party. We have examined such issued U.S. patents, the related U.S. and foreign applications and their file histories, the prior art and other information. Corresponding foreign applications were filed in Canada, Europe and Japan. The European application was rejected and abandoned and cannot be re-filed. The Japanese application has also lapsed and cannot be re-filed. Claims in the related Canadian application issued in 2007. We believe that such patents may not survive a challenge to patent validity but that it is unlikely that a court in any country would order us to stop marketing the only life-saving drug that is currently approved for this disease. However, the processes of patent law are uncertain and any patent proceeding is subject to multiple unanticipated outcomes. We believe that it is in the best interest of our joint venture with Genzyme to market Aldurazyme with commercial diligence, in order to provide MPS I patients with the benefits of Aldurazyme. We believe that these patents and patent applications do not affect our ability to market Aldurazyme in Europe. 
 We have patent protection in the European Patent Organization countries for Firdapse for the treatment of LEMS. These patents will expire in 2022. 
 With respect to Vimizim, we own or have licensed a number of patents and pending patent applications that relate generally to compositions of matter, methods of use and methods of production. We have rights to 
 13

204 issued patents including 17 issued U.S. patents with claims to compositions of purified recombinant N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (Vimizim) methods of treating Morquio Syndrome and sulfatase-modifying factor I (SUMF1) polypeptides and nucleic acids used in the manufacture of Vimizim. Issued U.S. patents cover SUMF1 compositions (set to expire in 2019), purified recombinant Vimizim compositions (set to expire in 2029) and methods of treating Morquio Syndrome (set to expire in 2029). We also have issued U.S. and European patents that cover methods of production (set to expire in 2024) and formulations (set to expire in 2031). 
 With respect to our clinical product candidates, we believe we have the necessary intellectual property rights to allowing us to undertake the development of these candidates. Certain of our product candidates are in therapeutic areas that have been the subject of many years of extensive research and development by academic organizations and third parties who may control patents or other intellectual property that they might assert against us, should one or more of our product candidates in these therapeutic areas succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and thereafter be commercialized. We continually evaluate the intellectual property rights of others in these areas in order to determine whether a claim of infringement may be made by others against us. Should we determine that a third party has intellectual property rights that could impact our ability to freely market a compound we consider a number of factors in determining how best to prepare for the commercialization of any such product candidate. In making this determination we consider, among other things, the stage of development of our product candidate and whether we and our outside counsel believe the intellectual property rights of others are valid, whether we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, whether a license is available upon commercially reasonable terms, whether we will seek to challenge the intellectual property rights of others, and the likelihood of and liability resulting from an adverse outcome should we be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. 
 Government Regulation 
 Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture, commercialization, pricing and reimbursement of our products. Our industry is subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Our present and future business has been, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. In the U.S., failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
 Our products require approval from the FDA, the EMA and corresponding agencies in other countries before they can be marketed. 
 Approval Process in the U.S. and EU 
 Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. and the EU typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the applicable regulatory agency of an application (e.g., an IND or a clinical trial application (CTA)), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which marketing approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA and EMA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation, as well as animal studies, to assess the characteristics and potential pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with FDA and/or EMA regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing, along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol are submitted to the applicable regulatory agency as part of an IND or CTA. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND or CTA is submitted. Until the CTA or IND is approved, or deemed approved following a waiting period, we may not start the clinical trial in the relevant jurisdiction. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with applicable regulations, good clinical practices (GCP), as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial and the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving 
 14

testing on patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and to the relevant regulatory agency in the EU as part of a new CTA. 
 The regulatory agencies may order the temporary halt or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if they believe that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee, for approval. An IRB/ethics committee may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB/ethics committee’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
 Clinical trials to support NDAs, BLAs or MAAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA and an MAA is prepared and submitted to the EMA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. and approval of the MAA by the EC is required before marketing of the product may begin in the EU. The NDA, BLA or MAA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing, a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls and proposed labeling, among other things. In the U.S., each NDA or BLA is subject to a significant user fee at the time of submission, unless a waiver is granted by the FDA. 
 The FDA and the EMA initially review the applications for a threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, typically within 30-60 days. The FDA or the EMA may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA/BLA or MAA, respectively, for filing or validation. Once the submission is accepted, the applicable agency begins an in-depth review. For the FDA, the review period for standard review applications is typically an additional ten months and, for priority review of drugs, that is, drugs that the FDA determines address a significant unmet need and represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, the review period is typically an additional six months in duration. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information submitted during the review or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. After the FDA evaluates the information provided in the NDA/BLA, it issues an approval letter, or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed, the FDA will re-initiate review. If it is satisfied that the deficiencies have been addressed, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. It is not unusual, however, for the FDA to issue a complete response letter because it believes that the drug is not safe enough or effective enough or because it does not believe that the data submitted are reliable or conclusive. 
 For the EMA, an application designated as standard review typically lasts approximately eleven months depending on the length of time sponsors take to address EMA questions. The accelerated assessment procedure is applicable to marketing authorization applications for medicinal products that are expected to be of major public health interest. For applications that receive accelerated assessment designation and are able to remain on this timeline the review typically lasts approximately seven months depending on the length of time sponsors take to address EMA questions. It is not unusual, however, for applications that receive accelerated assessment designation to revert to standard review, typically because the EMA has determined that the significance of the questions that the company needs to address would be more appropriate under the standard review timelines. At the end of the review period, EMA will issue an opinion either in support of marketing authorization (positive opinion) or recommending refusal of a marketing authorization (negative opinion). In the event of a negative opinion, the company may request a re-examination of the application. Within 60 days the company must provide the EMA detailed grounds for requesting re-examination. Within 60 days of providing this 
 15

information, the EMA will issue an opinion either in support of marketing authorization (positive opinion) or recommending refusal of a marketing authorization (negative opinion). In the event of a positive opinion, the EC will then grant marketing authorization in approximately 67 days. The EC follows the recommendation of the EMA in almost all cases. 
 During the review period, the FDA and/or the EMA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites and/or the sponsor to assure compliance with GCP regulations and will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured to ensure compliance with cGMPs regulations. Neither the FDA nor the EMA will approve the product unless compliance is satisfactory and the application contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. 
 A marketing approval authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 Combination Products 
 A combination product is a product comprising (i) two or more regulated components, i.e., drug/device, biologic/device, drug/biologic, or drug/device/biologic, that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; (ii) two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprising drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; (iii) a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or (iv) any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
 The FDA is divided into various branches, or Centers, by product type. Different Centers typically review drug, biologic, or device applications. In order to review an application for a combination product, the FDA must decide which Center should be responsible for the review. FDA regulations require that the FDA determine the combination product’s primary mode of action, or PMOA, which is the single mode of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The Center that regulates that portion of the product that generates the PMOA becomes the lead evaluator. If there are two independent modes of action, neither of which is subordinate to the other, the FDA makes a determination as to which Center to assign the product based on consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions or to the Center with the most expertise in evaluating the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product. When evaluating an application, a lead Center may consult other Centers but still retain complete reviewing authority, or it may collaborate with another Center, by which the Center assigns review of a specific section of the application to another Center, delegating its review authority for that section. Typically, the FDA requires a single marketing application submitted to the Center selected to be the lead evaluator, although the agency has the discretion to require separate applications to more than one Center. One reason to submit multiple evaluations is if the applicant wishes to receive some benefit that accrues only from approval under a particular type of application, like new drug product exclusivity. If multiple applications are submitted, each may be evaluated by a different lead Center. 
 The 21st Century Cures Act was signed into law on December 13, 2016. In Section 3038, the FDA is instructed that if a combination product has an approved constituent (e.g., an investigational drug delivered with devices already 510(k) cleared by the FDA), the FDA may only require the sponsor to submit data or information necessary to meet the standard for clearance or approval, taking into consideration incremental risks and benefits posed by the combination product, using a risk-based approach and taking into account any prior finding of safety and effectiveness or substantial equivalence for the approved constituent. It appears that the primary 
 16

purpose of this provision is to reduce the burden of proving the safety and effectiveness of the approved constituent by leveraging the FDA’s prior clearance or approval. The FDA is instructed to focus on the new constituent plus the incremental risk created by a new use of the approved constituent. It is too soon to understand how the FDA will implement this provision.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. In certain circumstances, disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. Moreover, there is an increasing trend in the EU requiring public disclosure of development data, in particular clinical trial data. These data were traditionally regarded as confidential commercial information; however, under policies recently adopted in the EU, clinical study data submitted to the EMA in MAAs, including pre-clinical data, and patient level data, may be subject to public disclosure.
The Hatch-Waxman Act 
 Upon approval of a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to submit to the FDA each patent that covers the applicant’s product or FDA approved method of using this product. Those patents are then published in the FDA’s Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strength(s), route of administration, and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. Alternatively, for a patent covering an approved method of use, an ANDA applicant may submit a statement to the FDA that the company is not seeking approval for the covered use. 
 If the ANDA applicant has submitted a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new condition of use, the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor, during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on that listed drug. Both of the five-year and three-year exclusivity periods, as well as any unexpired patents listed in the Orange Book for the listed drug, can be extended by six months if the FDA 
 17

grants the NDA sponsor a period of pediatric exclusivity based on studies submitted by the sponsor in response to a written request. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA and EMA to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which in the U.S. is defined as having a prevalence of less than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and in the EU is defined as no more than five in 10,000 people in the EU, which is equivalent to around 250,000 people or less. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a marketing application. 
 Orphan drug designation does not shorten the regulatory review and approval process, nor does it provide any advantage in the regulatory review and approval process. However, if an orphan drug later receives approval for the indication for which it has designation, the relevant regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA/BLA application user fee. Although obtaining approval to market a product with orphan drug exclusivity may be advantageous, we cannot be certain: 
  
• | that we will be the first to obtain approval for any drug for which we obtain orphan drug designation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that orphan drug designation will result in any commercial advantage or reduce competition; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that the limited exceptions to this exclusivity will not be invoked by the relevant regulatory authority.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost under certain conditions, such as if the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug. 
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 
PRIME Designation
 The EMA launched its PRIME regulatory initiative to enhance support for the development of therapies that target an unmet medical need. The initiative focuses on drugs that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients with no treatment options. These therapies are considered priority medicines within the EU. Through PRIME, the EMA offers early, proactive and enhanced support to drug developers to optimize the generation of robust data on a therapy’s benefits and risks and enable accelerated assessment of drug applications.
 Pediatric Information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2007 (PREA), NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indication(s) in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) provides sponsors of NDAs with an additional six-month period of market exclusivity for all unexpired patent or non-patent exclusivity on all forms of the drug containing the active moiety if the sponsor submits results of pediatric studies specifically requested by the FDA under BPCA within required timeframes. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) provides sponsors of BLAs an additional six-month extension for all unexpired non-patent market exclusivity on all forms of the biological containing the active moiety pursuant to the BPCA if the conditions under the BPCA are met. 
 18

Fast Track Designation 
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the FDA’s fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. 
 In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug’s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Post-Approval Regulatory Requirements 
 Following approval, the FDA and the EMA will impose certain post-approval requirements related to a product. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of approved products, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. 
 Approved products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a submission to and approval by the FDA or the EMA, as applicable, before the change can be implemented. An NDA/BLA or MAA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and similar procedures and actions in reviewing NDA/ BLA or MAA supplements as in reviewing NDAs/BLAs and MAAs. 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following marketing approval. Either the FDA or EMA may also require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as the manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug and biological product manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA or the EMA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to access compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, prescription drug manufacturers in the U.S. must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate products. 
 Good Manufacturing Practices
 The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to approving a product. If, after receiving approval from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. All facilities and manufacturing techniques used for the manufacture of our products must comply with applicable regulations governing the production of pharmaceutical products known as cGMPs. 
 The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities and processes following initial approval of a product. If, as a result of these inspections, it is determined that our equipment, facilities or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions 
 19

of product approval, regulatory agencies may require product recall, issue warning or similar letters or may seek civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions against us. 
 Healthcare Reform
 The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, in the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, the PPACA), is a sweeping measure intended to improve quality of care, constrain healthcare spending, and expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. 
 The BPCIA, which was enacted as part of the PPACA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” or “interchangeable” with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-licensed product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical study, absent a waiver from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In order to meet the higher hurdle of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. The first biosimilar product was approved under the BPCIA in 2015, though no interchangeable products have been approved to date. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being evaluated by the FDA. A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) eighteen months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is not patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. 
 The PPACA also imposed a fee on certain manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs (excluding orphan drugs under certain conditions). The annual fee is apportioned among the participating companies based on each company’s sales of qualifying products to, or use by, certain U.S. government programs during the preceding year. Other provisions of the law, have also affected us and have increased certain of our costs. For example, the Medicaid rebate rate was increased and the volume of rebated drugs has been expanded to include beneficiaries in Medicaid managed care organizations. Among other things, the PPACA also expanded the 340B drug discount program (excluding orphan drugs), including the creation of new penalties for non-compliance, and included a 50% discount on brand name drugs for Medicare Part D participants in the coverage gap, or “donut hole.” The law also revised the definition of “average manufacturer price” for reporting purposes. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been added, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. In addition, drug manufacturers are required to collect and report annually information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. The reported data are posted in searchable form on a public web site. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. It is still unclear the full impact that the PPACA will have on our business. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect that there will be additional challenges and amendments in the future, especially with the recent change in administration.
 Since January 2017, the U.S. President has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of any certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed legislation repealing the PPACA in its entirety, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. 
 20

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing the “individual mandate,” the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, effective January 1, 2019. Additionally, on January 23, 2018, the U.S. President signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to repeal or replace elements of the PPACA. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes included the Budget Control Act of 2011, which caused aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year effective April 1, 2013 which, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers. Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, at the federal level, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Further, Congress and the U.S. Administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback, false claims, patient data privacy and security, and transparency statutes and regulations. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. The PPACA amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. 
 Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. The PPACA amended the statute so that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims laws. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn are used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters.
 
21

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain types of individuals and entities, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members.
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, exclusion of a company’s products from reimbursement under federal healthcare programs, criminal fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, curtailment of operations and imprisonment. Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states. Other states prohibit providing various other marketing-related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, states including California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Currently, several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. 
 Approval Outside of the U.S./EU 
 For marketing outside the U.S. and the EU, we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing and marketing approval for our products. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, can differ from those in the U.S. and the EU and may require us to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. The amount of time required to obtain necessary approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA or EMA approval. In many countries outside of the U.S., approvals for pricing, coverage and reimbursement offered by third-party payers, including government payers and private insurance plans, are also required. 
 Anti-Corruption Legislation 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Similar laws exist in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, that restrict improper payments to public and private parties. Many countries have laws prohibiting these types of payments within the respective country. Historically, pharmaceutical companies have been the target of FCPA and other anti-corruption investigations and penalties. 
 Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Because the course of treatment for patients using our products is expensive, sales of our products depend, in significant part, on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement offered by third-party payers, including government payers and private insurance plans. Governments may regulate access to, prices of or reimbursement levels for our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products, and private insurers may be influenced by government reimbursement methodologies. 
 Third-party payers, such as government or private healthcare insurers, carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for drugs, examine their medical necessity, and review their cost effectiveness. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the third-party payer, the insurance plan and other factors. One payer’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the product. Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payer will pay for the product. A payer’s decision to provide 
 22

coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Outside of the U.S. our products are paid for by a variety of payers, with governments being the primary source of payment. Reimbursement in the EU and many other territories must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. In many countries the government closely regulates drug pricing and reimbursement and often has a significant discretion in determining whether a product will be reimbursed at all and, if it is, how much will be paid. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay patient access to and commercialization of our products. Payers in many countries use a variety of cost-containment measures that can include referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set their own price, mandatory price cuts and rebates. This international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices across countries and some cross-border trade in our products from markets with lower prices. Even after a price is negotiated, countries frequently request or require adjustments to the price and other concessions over time. 
 Government Programs for Marketed Drugs in the U.S. 
 Medicaid, the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and Medicare 
 Federal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having its products receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, must pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for all units of its covered outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program under either a fee-for-service arrangement or through a managed care organization. This federal requirement is effectuated through a Medicaid drug rebate agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. CMS administers the Medicaid drug rebate agreements, which provide, among other things, that the drug manufacturer will pay rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis and report certain price information on a monthly and quarterly basis. The rebates are based on prices reported to CMS by manufacturers for their covered outpatient drugs. For non-innovator products, generally generic drugs marketed under ANDAs, the rebate amount is 13% of the average manufacturer price (AMP) for the quarter. The AMP is the weighted average of prices paid to the manufacturer (1) directly by retail community pharmacies and (2) by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies. For innovator products (i.e., drugs that are marketed under NDAs or BLAs), the rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the AMP for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the best price for that same quarter. The best price is essentially the lowest price available to non-governmental entities. Innovator products may also be subject to an additional rebate that is based on the amount, if any, by which the product’s AMP for a given quarter exceeds the inflation-adjusted baseline AMP, which for most drugs is the AMP for the first full quarter after launch. Beginning in 2017, non-innovator products are also subject to an additional rebate.
 The statutory definition of AMP was amended in 2010. CMS has released the final rule pertaining to AMP and other aspects of the Medicaid drug rebate program, which was effective as of April 1, 2016.
 The terms of participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in additional or lesser rebate liability, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if a manufacturer were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information. 
 A manufacturer must also participate in a federal program known as the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available to pay for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under this program, the participating manufacturer agrees to charge certain safety net healthcare providers no more than an established discounted price for its covered outpatient drugs. The formula for determining the discounted price is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and the unit rebate amount as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above. 
 23

Federal law also requires that manufacturers report data on a quarterly basis to CMS regarding the pricing of drugs that are separately reimbursable under Medicare Part B. These are generally drugs, such as injectable products, that are administered “incident to” a physician service and are not generally self-administered. The pricing information submitted by manufacturers is the basis for reimbursement to physicians and suppliers for drugs covered under Medicare Part B. As with the Medicaid drug rebate program, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information. 
 Medicare Part D provides prescription drug benefits for seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare Part D beneficiaries have a gap in their coverage (between the initial coverage limit and the point at which catastrophic coverage begins) where Medicare does not cover their prescription drug costs, known as the coverage gap. However, by 2020 Medicare Part D beneficiaries will pay 25% of drug costs after they reach the initial coverage limit – the same percentage they were responsible for before they reached that limit – thereby closing the coverage gap. The cost of closing the coverage gap is being borne by innovator companies and the government through subsidies. Beginning in 2011, each manufacturer of drugs approved under NDAs or BLAs was required to enter into a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount agreement and provide a 50% discount on those drugs dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries in the coverage gap, in order for its drugs to be reimbursed by Medicare Part D. 
 Federal Contracting/Pricing Requirements 
 Manufacturers are also required to make their covered drugs, which are generally drugs approved under NDAs or BLAs, available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) of the General Services Administration. The law also requires manufacturers to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases of their covered drugs by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, and the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement or purchase of the manufacturer’s drugs under certain federal programs. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies for covered drugs must be no more than the Federal Ceiling Price (FCP), which is at least 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (Non-FAMP) for the prior year. The Non-FAMP is the average price for covered drugs sold to wholesalers or other middlemen, net of any price reductions. 
 The accuracy of a manufacturer’s reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs, or FSS contract prices may be audited by the government. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. If a manufacturer were found to have knowingly reported false prices, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the law provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per incorrect item. Finally, manufacturers are required to disclose in FSS contract proposals all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than the proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, manufacturers are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions. 
 Employees 
 As of February 13, 2018, we had 2,581 full-time employees, 1,133 of whom were in operations, 654 of whom were in research and development, 378 of whom were in sales and marketing and 416 of whom were in administration.  
 We consider our employee relations to be good. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced employment related work stoppages.

Segment and Geographic Area Financial Information
 Our chief operating decision maker (i.e., our chief executive officer) reviews financial information on a consolidated basis, for the purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Accordingly, we consider ourselves to have a single reporting segment and operating unit structure. 
 Net product revenues by geography are based on patients’ locations for our commercial products, which are sold directly by us, and global sales of Aldurazyme, which is marketed by Genzyme. Genzyme is our sole customer for Aldurazyme and is responsible for marketing and selling Aldurazyme to third parties. Although Genzyme sells Aldurazyme worldwide, the revenues earned by us on Genzyme’s net sales are not broken out by geographic region as the underlying revenue transactions are with Genzyme, whose headquarters are located in the U.S.
 The table below summarizes consolidated net product revenue based on patient location for Brineura, Firdapse, Kuvan, Naglazyme, and Vimizim, which are sold directly by us, and global sales of Aldurazyme, which is marketed by Genzyme (in millions):

The increase in non-monetary long-lived assets in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to increased costs related to our in-process projects at our manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by a net decrease in intangible assets due to normal amortization of the definite lived intangible assets. The increase in non-monetary long-lived assets in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to increased costs related to our in-process projects at our manufacturing facilities, partially offset by a net decrease in intangible assets resulting from the impairment of in-process research and development intangible assets due to program terminations in 2016.
