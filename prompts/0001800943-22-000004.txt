The number of members that have generated revenue in 2021 is approximately 30 customers/members. We do not determine at this time which members are active and which members are inactive. We currently do not have code written that provides these analytics. Part of the use of proceeds will enable us to bring on additional developers that will be able to write code that will provide this data.

We currently monetize Findit in several ways, through online content marketing campaigns, offering online products and tools through Findit.com and through our CBD Topical lines; Urban CBD Collective and Urban Lifestyle Collective. If users stop using the Findit platform or we do not have growth from new user’s this will hinder Findit’s growth in the event ales from CBD Topical products does not increase this will also prevent us from future growth in this sector of our business.

CBD Market Opportunity:
 
Currently the US market for industrial hemp and the products produced from industrial hemp is roughly USD 4.63 billion with CAGR of 13.7%. The global industrial hemp market is expected to reach USD $13.03 Billion by 2026, according to a new report by Reports and Data. Hemp may be cultivated as a renewable source for raw materials that can be implemented into numerous products. It is a lucrative rotation crop for farmers attributing to the characteristics of hemp to take in CO2, detoxify the soil, and inhibit soil erosion. Hemp seeds and flowers find application in health foods, organic cosmetic products, and other nutraceuticals (pharmaceutical- and standardized nutrient) whereas the fibers and stalks are incorporated in construction materials (such as hempcrete, hemp tile, hemp insulation), hemp clothing, paper, plastic composites, and biofuel among others. The total revenue generated from the sales of hemp products in the U.S. contributed to a substantial share of the global market. However, as of today most of the raw hemp material used in U.S. consumer products were imported from other countries.
Competition 
 Implications of Being an “Smaller Reporting Company”
 
Certain reduced reporting requirements and exemptions are available to us due to the fact that we qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation report regarding management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to a pay-for-performance graph or CEO pay ratio disclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.
 
Investors should be aware that we will be subject to the "Penny Stock" rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in Penny Stocks. These regulations may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for our stock, and investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares.
 
Competition
 
We face significant competition in almost every aspect of our business, including from companies such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Zillow and other press release distribution services. These competitors which offer a variety of Internet products, services, content, and online advertising offerings, as well as from mobile devices that offer products and services that may compete with specific Findit features. We also face competition from traditional and online media businesses for content to be posted on the Findit Platform.
 We currently are not running paid for advertising campaigns on Findit, but we plan to in the future. When Findit does offer paid for advertising we expect to face competition from these same companies. We compete broadly with Facebook, Instagram and Twitters social networking offerings along with Google, Yahoo and Bing for search queries. As we introduce new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition.
 Some of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources and better competitive positions in certain markets than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market requirements. Our competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Certain competitors, including Google, could use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantage against us in creating a similar search feature that offers people the ability to submit web pages for indexing under various titles and descriptions. Other social networking sites or sites that do not exist yet could create similar featured Findit offers to compete with our market share. As a result, our competitors may acquire and engage users at the expense of the growth or engagement of our user base, which may negatively affect our business and financial results.
 We believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:
 
• | the usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | the size and composition of our user base; 
• | the engagement of our users with our products; 
• | the timing and market acceptance of our products and our tools; 
• | our ability to monetize our products, including our ability to successfully monetize app usage;
