Item 1. Business
The Madison Square Garden Company is a Delaware corporation with our principal executive offices at Two Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, NY, 10121. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Madison Square Garden,” “MSG” or the “Company” refer collectively to The Madison Square Garden Company, a holding company, and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. We conduct substantially all of our business activities discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K through MSG Sports & Entertainment, LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Our telephone number is 212-465-6000, our Internet address is http://www.themadisonsquaregardencompany.com and the investor relations section of our web site is http://investor.msg.com. We make available, free of charge through the investor relations section of our web site, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as well as proxy statements, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). References to our web site in this report are provided as a convenience and the information contained on, or available through, our web site is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC.
The Company was incorporated on March 4, 2015 as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of MSG Networks Inc. (“MSG Networks”), formerly known as The Madison Square Garden Company. All the outstanding common stock of the Company was distributed to MSG Networks shareholders (the “Distribution”) on September 30, 2015 (the “Distribution Date”).
On June 27, 2018, the Company announced that its board of directors (“Board”) has authorized the Company’s management to explore a possible spin-off that would create a separately-traded public company comprised of its sports businesses, including the New York Knicks and New York Rangers professional sports franchises. We refer to the potential spin-off as the “Sports Distribution.” If the Company proceeds with the Sports Distribution, it would be structured as a tax-free transaction to all MSG shareholders. Upon completion of the contemplated separation, record holders of MSG common stock would receive a pro-rata distribution, expected to be equivalent, in aggregate, to an approximately two-thirds economic interest in the sports company. The remaining common stock, expected to be equivalent to an approximately one-third economic interest in the sports company, would be retained by the Company. There can be no assurance that the proposed transaction will be completed in the manner described above, or at all. The Company has not set a timetable for completion of this process. Completion of the transaction would be subject to various conditions, including certain league approvals, a private letter ruling from the IRS, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel and final Board approval. The Company may file a Form 10 registration statement with the SEC which would contain additional information about the proposed Sports Distribution.
Overview

Utilizing our powerful assets, brands and live event expertise, the Company delivers premium and unique experiences that set the standard for excellence and innovation while forging deep connections with diverse and passionate audiences. We manage our business through the following two operating segments:

Our professional sports franchises are collectively referred to herein as “our sports teams.” The MSG Sports segment also includes Counter Logic Gaming (“CLG”), a premier North American esports organization, and Knicks Gaming, MSG’s franchise that competes in the NBA 2K League. CLG and Knicks Gaming are collectively referred to herein as “our esports teams,” and, together with our sports teams, “our teams.” In addition, the MSG Sports segment promotes, produces and/or presents a broad array of other live sporting events, including professional boxing, college basketball, college hockey, professional bull riding, mixed martial arts, esports, tennis and college wrestling.

Our Strategy
The Madison Square Garden Company pursues opportunities that strengthen our portfolio of live experiences and capitalize on our iconic venues, popular sports franchises and exclusive entertainment content, as well as our expertise in venue management, bookings, marketing, sales and hospitality. We believe the Company’s unique assets and capabilities, coupled with our deep relationships in the sports and entertainment industries and our strong connection with our diverse and passionate audiences, are what set the Company apart. We continue to look for ways to improve our core operations, while we explore new opportunities to grow and innovate. Specific initiatives we are focused on include:

• | Developing championship caliber teams. The core goal of our sports strategy is to develop teams that consistently compete for championships in their leagues and support and drive revenue streams across the Company. We continue to explore new ways to increase engagement and revenue opportunities across the teams’ broad consumer and corporate customer bases.


• | Monetizing our exclusive sports content. The Company has media rights agreements with MSG Networks that provide a significant recurring and growing revenue stream to the Company, subject to the terms of such agreements. In addition, these agreements and our relationship with MSG Networks provide our fans with the ability to watch locally televised home and away games of the Knicks and Rangers, as well as other programming related to our teams, on MSG Networks’ award-winning regional sports networks.


• | Utilizing our integrated approach to marketing and sales. The Company possesses powerful sports and entertainment assets that can create significant value for our business. For example:


◦ | Our integrated approach to marketing partnerships allows us to use and sell our broad array of assets together in order to maximize their collective value, both for the Company and for our marketing partners. Our ability to offer compelling, broad-based marketing platforms, which we believe are unparalleled in sports and entertainment, enables us to attract world-class partners, such as our “Marquee” marketing partner, JPMorgan Chase, and our “Signature” marketing partners, which include — Anheuser-Busch, Charter Communications, Delta Airlines, DraftKings, Kia, Lexus, PepsiCo (beginning September 1, 2018), SAP and Squarespace.


◦ | We continue to forge deep direct-to-consumer relationships with customers and fans, with a focus on understanding how consumers interact with every aspect of the Company. A key component of this strategy is our large and growing proprietary customer database, which drives revenue and engagement across segments, benefiting the Company through ticket sales, merchandise sales and sponsorship activation. This database provides us with an opportunity to cross-promote our products and services, introducing customers to our wide range of assets and brands.

• | Utilizing a unique strategy for our performance venues. The Company has a collection of performance venues through which we deliver high-quality live sports and entertainment. In addition to our New York venues: The Garden, The Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre, our portfolio includes: the Forum in Inglewood, CA and The Chicago Theatre, and we have an exclusive booking agreement with respect to the Wang Theatre in Boston. These venues, along with our venue management capabilities, effective bookings strategy and proven expertise in sponsorships, marketing, ticketing and hospitality, have positioned the Company as an industry leader in live entertainment. We intend to leverage our unique assets, expertise and approach to drive growth and stockholder value, and to ensure we continue to create unmatched experiences for the benefit of all our stakeholders.


◦ | Maximizing the live entertainment experience for our customers. We use our first-class operations, coupled with new innovations and our ability to attract top talent, to deliver unforgettable experiences for our customers — whether they are first-time visitors, repeat customers, season ticket holders, or suite holders — ensuring they return to our venues. We have a track record of designing world-class facilities that exceed our customers’ expectations. This includes our renovations of Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, The Garden and the Forum to deliver top-quality amenities such as state-of-the-art lighting, sound and staging, a full suite of hospitality offerings and enhanced premium products. In addition to better onsite amenities, we continue to explore new ways to utilize technology to improve the customer experience and create communities around our live events. From the way our customers buy their food and beverage; to how we market and process their tickets; to the content we provide them to enhance their sports and entertainment experience, we want to give our customers the best in-venue experience in the industry.


◦ | Leveraging our live entertainment expertise to increase productivity across our performance venues. Part of what drives our success is our “artist first” approach. This includes our renovation of the Forum, which set a new bar for the artist experience by delivering superior acoustics and an intimate feel, along with amenities such as nine star-caliber dressing rooms and dedicated areas for production and touring crews. This talent-friendly environment, coupled with more date availability and our top-tier service, is not only attracting artists to our West Coast venue, but also bringing them back for repeat performances. We will continue to use our “artist first” approach to attract the industry’s top talent with the goal of increasing utilization across all our venues through more multi-night and multi-market concerts and other events, including more recurring high-profile shows that help expand our base of events. Examples of this strategy include our residencies — which feature legendary performers playing our venues each month, and have included Billy Joel at The Garden and Jerry Seinfeld at the Beacon Theatre.


◦ | Selectively expanding our performance venues in key music and entertainment markets. With the renovation of the Forum, we created the country’s only arena-sized venue dedicated to music and entertainment, which quickly established a strong presence in the market. We believe that, similar to Los Angeles, there are other select markets where our proven ability to develop music and entertainment-focused venues — coupled with our unique capabilities, expertise and “artist first” approach — will deliver a differentiated experience for artists, fans and partners. In May 2016, the Company announced plans to build a state-of-the-art new venue in Las Vegas focused specifically on music and entertainment. In February 2018, we further unveiled our vision for these venues, which will be known as MSG Sphere. We believe MSG Sphere venues will change live entertainment by pioneering the next generation of immersive experiences. The first MSG Sphere venue will debut in Las Vegas, one of the world’s most important entertainment destination cities. In February 2018, we also announced the purchase of land in Stratford, London, which we expect will become home to the Company’s first large-scale international venue and the second MSG Sphere. MSG Sphere venues will utilize advanced, cutting-edge technologies to create an entirely new platform that is expected to redefine how immersion and storytelling come together in live experiences. Because of the transformative nature of these venues, we believe there will be other markets — both domestic and international — where MSG Sphere can be successful. The design of MSG Sphere will be flexible to accommodate a wide range of sizes and capacities — from large-scale to smaller and more intimate — based on the needs of the individual market. Controlling and booking a network of world-class venues provides the Company with a number of avenues for potential growth, including driving increased bookings and greater marketing and sponsorship opportunities. As we explore selectively extending the MSG Sphere network, we will be open to multiple types of transaction structures, including owned, operated, and joint ventures. As we work with various companies to develop the technologies needed for MSG Sphere venues, we are focused on obtaining appropriate strategic rights with respect to intellectual property.

• | Expanding our entertainment dining and nightlife venues. The Company owns a controlling interest in TAO Group — a leader in the hospitality industry. TAO Group currently operates 25 entertainment dining and nightlife venues in New York City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Singapore and Sydney, Australia with globally-recognized brands that include: TAO, Marquee, Lavo, Avenue, The Stanton Social, Beauty & Essex and Vandal. TAO Group is actively developing opportunities in select markets — both domestically and internationally — to expand and, in June 2018, announced that it plans to open new entertainment dining and nightlife venues as part of Moxy Chelsea hotel in New York City, as well as TAO Chicago and Marquee Singapore.


• | Growing our portfolio of proprietary content. We continue to explore the creation of proprietary content and attractions that enable us to benefit from being both content creator and venue operator. This includes opportunities to develop theatrical productions for our existing and planned venues. For our planned MSG Sphere venues, we are developing a set of tools that will allow both MSG and third parties to create content for the platform, making content creation an intuitive experience — whether someone is adapting existing content or developing original creations that maximize the potential of the venue’s technologies. MSG expects to use these tools to create our own catalogue of content and original productions, establishing a library of unique and compelling material that can be used across MSG Sphere venues.


• | Exploring adjacencies that strengthen our business. As part of our commitment to creating unmatched experiences, we explore adjacencies that strengthen our position in sports and entertainment. Potential opportunities include new types of events and festivals, and new opportunities in hospitality, clubs, and food and beverage. Examples over the last several years include the Company’s purchase of a controlling interest in BCE, the entertainment production company known for creating and operating New England’s premier music festival — the Boston Calling Music Festival; TAO Group, a hospitality group with globally-recognized entertainment dining and nightlife brands; and CLG, a premier North American esports organization.


• | Continuing to explore external strategic opportunities. We continue to seek strategic opportunities to add compelling assets and brands that resonate with our customers and partners, fit with our core competencies and allow new opportunities for growth across the Company. One of the ways we try to capitalize on our unique combination of dynamic assets, established industry relationships and deep customer connections is through strategic partnerships that bring together the expertise and capabilities of each partner, and enable us to team with recognized leaders in their fields and benefit from growth in those businesses. For example, we own 50% of Azoff MSG Entertainment LLC (“AMSGE”) which is backed by one of the music and entertainment industry’s most respected and influential executives, Irving Azoff. The joint venture owns and operates music, media and entertainment businesses, which allows us to pursue various businesses in the entertainment space. In addition, we own 50% of Tribeca Enterprises LLC (“Tribeca Enterprises”), bringing together two of New York’s cultural and entertainment icons to enhance the reach and impact of both brands, while allowing us to partner with one of the most respected teams in the film and entertainment industry.

Our Business
MSG Sports
Our Company is synonymous with some of the greatest sporting events in history. Today that tradition continues with our commitment to delivering a broad array of world-class sporting events that create lasting and indelible memories for sports fans. Our MSG Sports segment includes some of the world’s most recognized sports franchises, as well as a diverse selection of other live sporting events, that the Company promotes, produces and/or presents, primarily at The Garden, The Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden and the Forum.
Our Sports Franchises
The Knicks and Rangers are two of the most recognized franchises in professional sports, with storied histories and passionate, multi-generational fan bases. These teams are the primary occupants of The Garden, playing a combined total of 82 regular season home games, often to at or near capacity attendance. The Liberty currently play 15 home games at the Westchester County Center, located in White Plains, NY, in addition to two regular season home games at The Garden. For all of our sports teams, the number of home games increases if they qualify for the playoffs.
New York Knicks
As an original franchise of the NBA, the Knicks have a rich history that includes eight trips to the NBA Finals and two NBA Championships, as well as some of the greatest athletes to ever play the game. In May 2018, the Knicks introduced a new head coach, David Fizdale, who will lead a young and exciting franchise into the 2018-19 season focused on fielding a championship-caliber team over the long-term. The Knicks ranked in the top three in the NBA for ticket sales receipts for the 2017-18 regular season.
4

New York Rangers
The Rangers hockey club is one of the “original six” franchises of the NHL, with 2017-18 marking the team’s 91st season. Winners of four Stanley Cup Championships and 11 conference titles over their history, the Rangers continue to be one of the league’s marquee teams, advancing to the playoffs in 11 of the past 13 seasons. The Rangers are known to have one of the most passionate, loyal and enthusiastic fan bases in all of sports, and ranked in the top three in the NHL for ticket sales receipts for the 2017-18 regular season.
New York Liberty
Established in October 1996, when New York was selected as one of eight charter members of the WNBA, the Liberty have won three conference championships and appeared in the playoffs 15 times. In the 2017 season, the Liberty finished with the best record in the Eastern Conference for a third straight season and qualified for the WNBA playoffs as the number three overall seed. In November 2017, the Company announced that it is pursuing the sale of the Liberty. 
Westchester Knicks
The Westchester Knicks, an NBAGL team, plays its home games at the Westchester County Center in White Plains, NY and serves as the exclusive NBAGL affiliate of the Knicks. In the 2017-18 season, the Westchester Knicks had the best regular season record in the Eastern Conference. 
Hartford Wolf Pack
The Hartford Wolf Pack, a minor-league hockey team, is the player development team for the Rangers and is also competitive in its own right in the AHL. The Rangers send draft picks and other players to the Hartford Wolf Pack for skill development and injury rehabilitation, and can call up players for the Rangers roster to enhance the team’s competitiveness. The Hartford Wolf Pack have reached the playoffs 15 times in 21 seasons.
Esports
The Company’s portfolio of live experiences includes a presence in the esports industry through a controlling interest in CLG, a premier North American esports organization. Founded in 2010, CLG is one of the most established and successful organizations in the industry, operating eight teams across several well-known esports games: “League of Legends,” “Fortnite,” “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,” “Super Smash Bros.,” “Smite,” “H1Z1,” and “Clash Royale.” In 2018, Knicks Gaming, our franchise in the NBA 2K Esports League, made its debut as part of the league’s inaugural season and qualified for the playoffs.
The Role of the Leagues in Our Operations
As franchises in professional sports leagues, our teams are members of their respective leagues and, as such, are subject to certain limitations, under certain circumstances, on the control and management of their affairs. The respective league constitutions of our sports teams, under which each league is operated, together with the collective bargaining agreements (each a “CBA”) each league has signed with its players’ association, contain numerous provisions that, as a practical matter in certain circumstances, could impact the manner in which we operate our businesses. In addition, under the respective league constitutions of our sports teams, the commissioner of each league, either acting alone or with the consent of a majority (or, in some cases, a supermajority) of the other sports teams in the league, may be empowered in certain circumstances to take certain actions felt to be in the best interests of the league, whether or not such actions would benefit our sports teams and whether or not we consent or object to those actions.
While the precise rights and obligations of member teams vary from league to league, the leagues have varying degrees of control exercisable under certain circumstances over the length and format of the playing season, including preseason and playoff schedules; the operating territories of the member teams; national and international media and other licensing rights; admission of new members and changes in ownership; franchise relocations; indebtedness affecting the franchises; and labor relations with the players’ associations, including collective bargaining, free agency, and rules applicable to player transactions, luxury taxes and revenue sharing. See “Part II — Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Business Overview — MSG Sports — Expenses.” Additionally, CLG operates multiple teams that participate in several different esports leagues. The rights and obligations of each CLG team (and member teams generally) vary from league to league. The leagues are generally empowered to and have implemented rules with respect to our league participation, as well as operation, and monetization of the CLG teams and brand. From time to time, we may disagree with or challenge actions the leagues take or the power and authority they assert, although the leagues’ governing documents and our agreements with the leagues purport to limit the manner in which we may challenge decisions and actions by a league commissioner or the league itself.

Other Sporting Events
The Company’s MSG Sports segment also includes a broad array of live sporting events that the Company promotes, produces and/or presents, including professional boxing, college basketball, college hockey, professional bull riding, mixed martial arts, esports, tennis and college wrestling. Many of these events are among the most popular in our history and are perennial highlights on our annual calendar, as well as some of The Garden’s longest-running associations.
Professional boxing, beginning with John L. Sullivan in 1882, has had a long history with The Garden. The Arena famously hosted Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier’s 1971 “Fight of the Century,” considered among the greatest sporting events in modern history, as well as numerous bouts featuring dozens of other boxing greats. These have included: Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Robinson, Willie Pep, Emile Griffith, George Foreman, Roberto Duran, Oscar De La Hoya, Sugar Ray Leonard, Lennox Lewis, Roy Jones, Jr., Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Miguel Cotto, Wladimir Klitschko, Gennady Golovkin, and Vasiliy Lomachenko, one of the world’s best pound-for-pound fighters, who captured the WBA lightweight title at The Garden in May 2018.
The Company has also expanded its presence in the popular sport of mixed martial arts. In June 2016, the Forum hosted its first-ever Ultimate Fighting Championship (“UFC”) event with Michael Bisping capturing the middleweight title in an upset victory over Luke Rockhold at UFC 199. The Garden then hosted the historic UFC 205 in November 2016, the first professional mixed martial arts event in New York state since 1995, during which Conor McGregor knocked out Eddie Alvarez to become the first simultaneous two-weight champion in UFC history. In November 2017, UFC returned to The Garden, as mixed martial arts legend Georges St. Pierre made his much-anticipated comeback to the octagon to capture the middleweight title at UFC 217, one of three championship belts to change hands that evening. Bellator MMA has also hosted internationally-broadcasted events at both The Garden and the Forum, and Professional Fighters League has hosted events at The Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden and The Chicago Theatre.
College sports have been a mainstay at The Garden for decades, with college basketball’s longest running holiday showcase, the Holiday Festival, first tipping off more than 60 years ago. In addition to St. John’s University calling The Garden its “home away from home,” this past year the highly-anticipated Big East Tournament celebrated its 36th year and the Big Ten Men’s Basketball Tournament held its championship at The Garden in March for the first time. Other college basketball highlights include visits from Duke University’s Blue Devils and the Villanova Wildcats, who played four games at The Garden on their way to winning the 2018 National Championships, as well as the annual Jimmy V Classic and the 2K Sports Classic.
In 2007, The Garden sold out its first college hockey game — Red Hot Hockey featuring Cornell University versus Boston University — which has become a popular biennial event that Cornell won for the first time in 2017. College hockey has continued to grow at The Garden and become a fan-favorite over the last decade, attracting top national teams such as Boston College, North Dakota, Michigan and Minnesota.
Other recent world-class sporting events have included the NBA All-Star Game, which The Garden last hosted in 2015, marking the fifth time the arena has hosted the illustrious professional basketball event and the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball East Regional Finals, which The Garden hosted in 2014 and 2017, and will again in 2020. Additionally, The Garden has featured numerous tennis legends on its court, including Pete Sampras, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, and in March 2018, welcomed tennis luminaries Serena and Venus Williams back for Tie Break Tens, the competition’s first event held in the United States.
These live sporting events are not contemplated to be included as part of the possible Sports Distribution.
MSG Entertainment
Our Company delivers unforgettable entertainment experiences — including live events and spectacular productions — all in extraordinary settings that span some of the country’s largest entertainment markets. This creates a significant demand for an association with our brands — by artists, premier companies and the public. And with a foundation of iconic venues, our Company has a proven ability to leverage the strength of our industry relationships, marketing assets, customer database and live event expertise to create performance, promotion and distribution opportunities for artists, events and productions, and to increase utilization of our venues.
Specifically, our MSG Entertainment segment includes concerts, family shows, performing arts events and special events that we present or host at our venues, which are: The Garden, The Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, the Forum and The Chicago Theatre. In addition, we have an exclusive booking agreement with respect to the Wang Theatre. With seating capacities and configurations that range from 2,800 to 21,000, our collection of diverse venues enables us to showcase acts that cover a wide spectrum of genres and popular appeal.
6

Our MSG Entertainment segment also includes the beloved holiday show, the Christmas Spectacular — created for Radio City Music Hall and featuring the world-famous Rockettes. The Company is also exploring opportunities for a second, streamlined show featuring the iconic Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall.
Over the past couple of years, the Company has been executing on its plans to build a robust, diversified portfolio of live experiences. In July 2016, the Company acquired a controlling interest in BCE, the entertainment production company that owns and operates the Boston Calling Music Festival. This was followed in January 2017 by the Company’s purchase of a controlling interest in TAO Group, a hospitality group with globally-recognized entertainment dining and nightlife brands.
Our Live Entertainment Bookings
Our Company is an established industry leader that books a wide variety of live entertainment events in our venues, which perennially include some of the biggest names in music and entertainment. Over the last several years, our venues have been a key destination for artists such as the Eagles, U2, Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters, Paul McCartney, Kendrick Lamar, Bruno Mars, Justin Bieber, Dead and Company, Madonna, Mumford & Sons, Phish, Fleetwood Mac, Adele, Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen, Rihanna, Justin Timberlake, Katy Perry, Kanye West, Stevie Wonder, Ariana Grande and Dave Chappelle.
Our efforts to find new ways to increase the utilization of our venues led to a unique partnership between our Company and Billy Joel that made the renowned performer a staple of The Garden, playing monthly performances since January 2014. This extraordinary residency has been a great success, with 54 sold-out performances through July 2018, and has cemented Billy Joel’s record for the most performances by any artist at “The World’s Most Famous Arena.” In December 2015, the legendary New Yorker and comedian Jerry Seinfeld began a two-year residency at the Beacon Theatre, with monthly appearances in 2016 and twice monthly appearances in 2017. All 36 performances — which concluded in December 2017 — were sold out.
Our venues also attract family shows and theatrical productions, which this past year included: PAW Patrol Live!, Sesame Street Live!, PJ Masks Live!, and Elf The Musical. In addition, we frequently serve as the backdrop for high-profile special events such as the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, which returned to The Garden for the first time in 15 years in 2018. Other significant events that have been hosted in our venues include the Tony Awards, “America’s Got Talent,” and the MTV Video Music Awards; appearances by luminaries such as His Holiness Pope Francis, His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi; graduations, television upfronts, product launches and film premieres. 
Although we primarily license our venues to third-party promoters for a fee, we also promote or co-promote shows where we have economic risk relating to the event. MSG Entertainment currently does not promote or co-promote events outside of our venues.
Our Productions
One of the Company’s core properties, the Christmas Spectacular, has been performed at Radio City Music Hall for 85 years. The world-famous Rockettes, along with show-stopping performances, festive holiday scenes and state-of-the-art special effects, have played an important role in the critically-acclaimed show’s enduring popularity. This past year the show featured several new technology enhancements, including the ability to project content on all eight of Radio City Music Hall’s proscenium arches. This large-scale projection, along with a backdrop that now includes one of the world’s largest 8K resolution LED screens, visually transformed entire scenes of the production. During the 2017 holiday season, the Christmas Spectacular sold more than one million tickets.
We acquired the rights to the Christmas Spectacular in 1997, and those rights are separate from, and do not depend on the continuation of, our lease of Radio City Music Hall. We also hold rights to the Rockettes brand in the same manner.
The Company believes it has significant and unique assets in both Radio City Music Hall and the Rockettes, and is exploring the creation of a second, streamlined show that leverages not only these brands, but also the technology enhancements we have invested at the venue. 
In addition, we continue to strengthen and broaden our Rockettes brand, targeting the most prominent and effective vehicles that elevate their visibility and underscore their reputation as beloved American cultural icons. The Rockettes have appeared or performed at high-profile events, including Presidential Inaugurations, the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Macy’s 4th of July Fireworks event, the New Year’s Eve Times Square Ball Drop, the Tony Awards, and television shows (“America’s Got Talent,” “Project Runway,” “The Today Show,” “Live with Kelly and Ryan,” and “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon”), among many others. We continue to pursue opportunities to generate greater brand awareness, including television and public appearances and dance education offerings.

Our Entertainment Dining and Nightlife Offerings
The Company owns a controlling interest in TAO Group, which strengthens the Company’s portfolio of live offerings with a complementary, hospitality group with widely-recognized brands that include: TAO, Marquee, Lavo, Avenue, The Stanton Social, Beauty & Essex and Vandal. Since 2000, TAO Group has been creating some of the most innovative premium experiences in the entertainment dining and hospitality industry. Today, TAO Group operates 25 venues – 12 venues in New York City, six venues in Las Vegas, five venues in Los Angeles, one venue in Singapore and one venue in Sydney, Australia — and is actively developing opportunities to expand on their success with new venues. In June 2018, TAO Group announced that it will debut new entertainment dining and nightlife venues as part of Moxy Chelsea hotel in New York City, which is expected to open this Fall, as well as TAO Chicago restaurant and nightclub in September, followed by Marquee Singapore, located in the Marina Bay Sands hotel, in 2019.
A majority of TAO Group’s venues are leased, while the rest are managed. Essentially all of the venues have either long-term leases or long-term management agreements with options to renew for multiple years.
Our Festival Offering
The Company owns a controlling interest in BCE, the entertainment production company known for successfully creating and operating New England’s premier music festival — Boston Calling. The 2018 three-day festival took place over Memorial Day weekend at the Harvard Athletic Complex, and was headlined by Eminem, The Killers and Jack White. Additionally, the festival featured 54 performances from musicians, bands, podcasts and comedians across its three stages and indoor arena, as well as the first-ever Boston Calling Film Festival, curated by Academy Award-winning actress, producer and director Natalie Portman.
Our Performance Venues
The Company operates a mix of iconic performance venues that continue to build on their historic prominence as destinations for unforgettable experiences and events. Individually, these venues are each premier showplaces, with a passionate and loyal following of fans, performers and events. Taken together, we believe they represent an outstanding collection of venues.
We own or operate under long-term leases a total of six venues in New York City, Chicago and Inglewood, CA and have an exclusive booking agreement with respect to the Wang Theatre in Boston. Our New York City venues are the Madison Square Garden Complex (which includes both The Garden and The Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden), Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre. Our portfolio of venues also includes the Forum in Inglewood, CA and the landmark The Chicago Theatre.
The Garden
The Garden has been a celebrated center of New York life since it first opened its doors in 1879. Over its 139-year history, there have been four Garden buildings, each known for showcasing the best of the era’s live sports and entertainment offerings. We believe that The Garden has come to epitomize the power and passion of live sports and entertainment to people around the world, with an appearance at The Garden often representing a pinnacle of an athlete’s or performer’s career. Known as “The World’s Most Famous Arena,” The Garden has been the site of some of the most memorable events in sports and entertainment, and, together with The Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden, has hosted hundreds of events and millions of visitors this past year. In 2009, Billboard Magazine ranked The Garden the number one venue of the decade in its respective class based upon gross ticket sales. Music industry subscribers of the trade magazine Pollstar have voted The Garden “Arena of the Year” 19 out of the last 25 years. The Garden is the highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the nation and the second highest in the world based on Billboard Magazine’s 2018 mid-year rankings.
The Garden is home to the Knicks and Rangers and is associated with countless “big events,” inspired performances and one-of-a-kind moments. Highlights include: “The Fight of the Century” between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in 1971; the 1970 Knicks’ NBA Championship; the Rangers’ 1994 Stanley Cup Championship; three Democratic National Conventions and one Republican National Convention; Marilyn Monroe’s famous birthday serenade to President John F. Kennedy; Frank Sinatra’s “Main Event” concert in 1974; the only U.S. concerts from the reunited Cream; the 25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame concerts and Billy Joel’s record-breaking 100 total performances at The Garden (through July 2018). In September 2015, His Holiness Pope Francis celebrated Mass at The Garden as part of his successful U.S. visit, which marked the first time a current pope has visited The Garden since Pope John Paul II in 1979. The Garden has also hosted four prominent benefit concerts, which galvanized the public to respond to national and global crises, including the first of its kind, “The Concert for Bangladesh” in 1972, as well as “The Concert for New York City,” following the events of 9/11; “From the Big Apple to the Big Easy,” held after Hurricane Katrina in 2005; and “12-12-12, The Concert for Sandy Relief” in 2012.

The current Madison Square Garden Complex, located between 31st and 33rd Streets and Seventh and Eighth Avenues on Manhattan’s West Side, opened on February 11, 1968 with a salute to the United Service Organizations hosted by Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. From a structural standpoint, the construction of the current Garden was considered an engineering wonder for its time, including its famous circular shape and unique, cable-supported ceiling, which contributes to its intimate feel. It was the first large structure built over an active railroad track. The builder, R.E. McKee, had a national reputation and was later recognized as a “Master Builder” by the construction industry. Architect Charles Luckman had one of the largest firms in the country and designed such buildings as the Prudential Tower in Boston, NASA’s flight center in Houston and the Forum in Inglewood, CA.
Following a three-year, top-to-bottom transformation, in October 2013, the Company debuted a fully-transformed Garden, featuring improved sightlines; additional entertainment and dining options; new concourses; upgraded hospitality areas; new technology; unique historic exhibits; and a completely transformed interior, where the intimacy of the arena bowl and The Garden’s world-famous ceiling were maintained. Focused on the total fan experience, the transformation was designed to benefit everyone in attendance, whether first time visitors, season ticket subscribers, athletes, artists, suite holders or marketing partners. The Garden’s transformation ensured that attending an event at “The World’s Most Famous Arena” remained unlike anywhere else. 
We own the Madison Square Garden Complex, the platform on which it is built and development rights (including air rights) above our property. Madison Square Garden sits atop Pennsylvania Station (“Penn Station”), a major commuter hub in Manhattan, which is owned by the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak). While the development rights we own would permit us to expand in the future, any such use of development rights would require various approvals from the City of New York. The Garden seats up to approximately 21,000 spectators for sporting and entertainment events and, along with The Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden, contains approximately 1,100,000 square feet of floor space over 11 levels.
The Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden
The Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden, which has approximately 5,600 seats, opened as part of the fourth Madison Square Garden Complex in 1968 with seven nights of performances by Judy Garland. Since then, some of the biggest names in live entertainment have played The Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden, including The Who, Bob Dylan, Diana Ross, Elton John, James Taylor, Mary J Blige, Pentatonix, Sara Bareilles, Ellie Goulding, Chris Rock, Neil Young, Bill Maher, Radiohead, Jerry Seinfeld and Van Morrison. The Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden has also hosted boxing events and the NBA Draft; award shows such as The Daytime Emmys; and other special events including “Wheel of Fortune” and audition shows for “America’s Got Talent,” as well as a variety of theatrical productions and family shows, including A Christmas Story, Elf The Musical, Paw Patrol Live!, and Sesame Street Live!. In March 2018, the Company and Hulu, a leading premium streaming service, announced a multi-faceted marketing partnership that included exclusive naming rights to the venue, which has now been rebranded as The Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden. The Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden is the fifth highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the world, based on Billboard Magazine’s 2018 mid-year rankings.
Radio City Music Hall
Radio City Music Hall has a rich history as a national theatrical and cultural mecca since it was first built by theatrical impresario S.L. “Roxy” Rothafel in 1932. Known as “The Showplace of the Nation,” it was the first building in the Rockefeller Center complex and, at the time, the largest indoor theater in the world. Radio City Music Hall, a venue with approximately 6,000 seats, hosts concerts, family shows and special events, and is home to the Christmas Spectacular. See “— MSG Entertainment — Our Productions.” Entertainers who have graced the Great Stage include: Yes, Lady Gaga, Brian Wilson, Harry Styles, Bastille, John Mulaney, Jack White, Kelly Clarkson, Britney Spears, Tony Bennett, Khalid, Sebastian Maniscalco and Dave Chappelle. In 2009, Billboard Magazine ranked Radio City Music Hall the number one venue of the decade in its respective class based upon gross ticket sales. Radio City Music Hall is the highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the world, based on Billboard Magazine’s 2018 mid-year rankings.
In 1978, Radio City Music Hall was designated a New York City landmark by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission and a national landmark on the National Register of Historic Places. We acquired the lease in 1997, and in 1999, we invested in a complete restoration that returned the legendary theater to its original grandeur. Our acclaimed restoration touched all aspects of the venue and included burnishing the ceilings of Radio City Music Hall with 720,000 sheets of gold and aluminum leaf, replacing the existing stage curtain with a new 112-foot wide golden silk curtain, and cleaning the three-story tall mural “The Fountain of Youth,” by Ezra Winter, which looms above the grand staircase. State-of-the-art sound systems, lighting and HDTV capabilities were also installed.
We lease Radio City Music Hall, located at Sixth Avenue and 50th Street in Manhattan, pursuant to a long-term lease agreement. The lease on Radio City Music Hall expires in 2023. We have the option to renew the lease for an additional 10 years by providing two years’ notice prior to the initial expiration date.

Beacon Theatre
In November 2006, we entered into a long-term lease agreement to operate the legendary Beacon Theatre, a venue with approximately 2,800 seats, which sits on the corner of Broadway and 74th Street in Manhattan. The Beacon Theatre was conceived of by S. L. “Roxy” Rothafel and is considered the “older sister” to Radio City Music Hall. Designed by Chicago architect Walter Ahlschlager, the Beacon Theatre opened in 1929 as a forum for vaudeville acts, musical productions, drama, opera, and movies. The Beacon Theatre was designated a New York City landmark by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1979 and a national landmark on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Over its history, the Beacon Theatre has been a venerable rock and roll room for some of the greatest names in music including Steely Dan, Coldplay, Mariah Carey, Crosby Stills & Nash, Elton John, John Fogerty, Ray LaMontagne, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Eddie Vedder and Bob Dylan, as well as The Allman Brothers Band, which played their 238th show at the Beacon Theatre in October 2014, marking their final concert as a band. The venue has also hosted special events such as film premieres for the Tribeca Film Festival and comedy events, including our Jerry Seinfeld residency, along with numerous luminaries such as His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 2009 and 2013, and President Bill Clinton in 2006 when the Rolling Stones played a private concert in honor of his 60th birthday. 
In August of 2008 we closed the Beacon Theatre for a seven-month restoration project to return the theater to its original 1929 grandeur. The restoration of the Beacon Theatre focused on all historic, interior public spaces of the building, backstage and back-of-house areas, and was based on extensive historic research, as well as detailed, onsite examination of original, decorative painting techniques that had been covered by decades-old layers of paint. The Beacon Theatre has won several architectural awards recognizing its outstanding restoration. The widely acclaimed, comprehensive restoration was similar to our restoration of Radio City Music Hall, and reflects our commitment to New York City. The Beacon Theatre is the tenth highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the world, based on Billboard Magazine’s 2018 mid-year rankings.
Our lease on the Beacon Theatre expires in 2026.
The Forum
In June 2012, we added a West Coast home with the purchase of the Forum in Inglewood, CA, which serves the Greater Los Angeles area. Following an extensive reinvention of the historic venue, on January 15, 2014, the Forum re-opened with the first of six concerts by the legendary Eagles and is once again a thriving destination for both artists and music fans. With both the Forum and The Garden, the Company has an iconic arena in each of the country’s two largest entertainment markets.
The Forum is the only arena-sized venue in the country dedicated to music and entertainment, and offers something exceptional for everyone. Architecturally, the interior of the bowl has been completely modernized and features superior acoustics, along with flexible seating that ranges from 7,000 seats to 17,600 seats. Fans seated on the floor have access to one of the largest general admission floors in the country, with approximately 8,000 square feet of event level hospitality offerings. The Forum also offers exclusive spaces for VIP customers, including the historic Forum Club, and, for artists, delivers a first-class experience that includes nine, star-caliber dressing rooms with high-end amenities. Among the key features that were resurrected in an effort to replicate the original design is the exterior color of the venue, which was returned to the 1960’s “California sunset red,” and is now known as “Forum Red.” Other outdoor features include the addition of a distinct and iconic Forum marquee and a 40,000-square foot terrace that surrounds the perimeter of the building.
The original Forum was designed by renowned architect, Charles Luckman, who also designed The Garden that opened in 1968. The historic West Coast venue, which opened in 1967, has played host to some of the greatest musical performers of all time, including The Rolling Stones, The Jackson 5, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, Madonna, Van Halen, Foo Fighters, Coldplay, Prince and many others. In addition, the Forum was home to the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings until 1999.
Since re-opening in 2014, the Forum has received several architectural awards recognizing its outstanding restoration. The venue’s impressive lineup of entertainers has included: the Eagles, Justin Timberlake, U2, Maroon 5, Drake, Kanye West, Eric Clapton, Guns N’ Roses, Stevie Wonder, Aerosmith, Steely Dan, Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Mumford & Sons, Foo Fighters, The Weeknd, P!nk and Rihanna as well as His Holiness the Dalai Lama. The Forum has also hosted a number of special events such as the MTV Video Music Awards and Nickelodeon’s Kids’ Choice Awards, as well as select sporting events, including Championship Boxing and mixed martial arts. The Forum is the third highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the world, based on Billboard Magazine’s 2018 mid-year rankings.
The Chicago Theatre
In October 2007, to provide us with an anchor for content and distribution in a key market in the Midwest, we purchased the legendary Chicago Theatre, a venue with approximately 3,600 seats. The Chicago Theatre, which features its famous six-story-high “C-H-I-C-A-G-O” marquee, was built in 1921 and designed in the French Baroque style by architects Cornelius W. Rapp and George L. Rapp. It is the oldest surviving example of this architectural style in Chicago today, and was designated a Chicago landmark building in 1983 by the Mayor of Chicago and the Chicago City Council.
10

The Chicago Theatre has become a highly attractive destination for concerts, comedy shows and other live events, hosting a wide range of entertainers, including Bob Dylan, Mumford & Sons, David Byrne, Neil Young, Steve Winwood, Jerry Seinfeld, Janet Jackson, The National, Jim Gaffigan, Conan O’Brien, Aziz Ansari and Steely Dan. The venue has also hosted theatrical tours such as A Christmas Story, The Wizard of Oz and Dr. Seuss’ How The Grinch Stole Christmas!. The Chicago Theatre is the seventh highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the world, based on Billboard Magazine’s 2018 mid-year rankings.
Wang Theatre
Since August 2008, we have had a booking agreement with respect to the historic Wang Theatre in Boston. Under the booking agreement, we have been utilizing our diverse relationships and experience in event production and entertainment marketing to maximize the quantity and diversity of performances staged at the Wang Theatre. These performances have included theatrical productions and family shows such as the Tony award-winning Annie the Musical, Irving Berlin’s White Christmas the Musical, The Sound of Music, A Christmas Story, and Elf The Musical. The Wang Theatre has also welcomed a variety of concerts, including multi-night runs by Steely Dan, Sting, Neil Young, Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, Steve Martin and The National and performances from Leonard Cohen, Ringo Starr, Wilco, Tegan and Sara, John Legend and The Shins. The Wang Theatre seats approximately 3,600.
Our booking agreement expires in 2019. The expiration of the booking agreement will not have a material negative effect on our business.
MSG Sphere
The Company is moving forward with its plans to create the “venue of the future.” These structures — known as MSG Sphere — will use cutting-edge technologies to create the next-generation of immersive experiences. The Company will build its first MSG Sphere in Las Vegas on land leased from Las Vegas Sands Corp. (“Sands”), which is adjacent to the Venetian/Palazzo/Sands Expo Complex. The Company plans to break ground on the more than 18,000-seat venue during September 2018 with the start of site preparations, with the goal of opening in fiscal 2021. 
Key design features of MSG Sphere are expected to include (i) a fully programmable LED exterior and an interior bowl that features the world’s largest and highest resolution LED screen known today, (ii) a multi-layered audio system that will deliver a spectacular acoustical experience, (iii) a custom video system capable of capturing, curating and distributing both today’s and tomorrow’s content, and (iv) an advanced architecture for connectivity that will enable a broader range of content, greater interaction among guests and more immersive entertainment experiences. Sands will provide us with $75 million to help fund the construction costs, including the cost of a pedestrian bridge from MSG Sphere Las Vegas to the Venetian/Palazzo/Sands Expo Complex. Sands will receive priority access to purchase tickets to events at the venue for inclusion in hotel packages or other uses, as well as certain rent-free use of the venue to support its Expo Center business. The ground lease will have no fixed rent; however, if certain return objectives are achieved, Sands will receive 25% of the after-tax cash flow in excess of such objectives. The lease is for a term of 50 years.
In February 2018, we announced the purchase of land in Stratford, London, which we expect will become home to the Company’s second MSG Sphere. Subject to the timely completion of the planning and governmental approval process, our goal is to have our MSG Sphere London debut approximately one year after the Las Vegas venue. We currently expect that MSG Sphere London will be substantially similar to MSG Sphere Las Vegas, including having approximately the same seating capacity.
We continue to explore additional domestic and international markets where next-generation venues can be successful. The design of MSG Sphere will be flexible to accommodate a wide range of sizes and capacities — from large-scale to smaller and more intimate — based on the needs of any individual market. As we explore selectively extending the MSG Sphere network, we will be open to multiple types of transaction structures, including owned, operated, and joint ventures.

Our Interactive Initiatives
The Company has a digital presence that includes web sites, social networking sites and mobile applications for our sports and entertainment properties. In 2017, the Company consolidated a collection of individual web sites dedicated to our venues into a new platform, MSG.com, designed to deliver greater value to our customers by providing one place where they can explore upcoming events in all our venues, learn more about our brands, and purchase tickets. Web sites dedicated to our teams (nhl.com/rangers, nba.com/knicks, liberty.wnba.com, westchester.gleague.nba.com, hartfordwolfpack.com, clg.gg, knicksgaming.nba.com) remain separate from MSG.com, as do the web sites for TAO Group (taogroup.com) and Boston Calling (bostoncalling.com). Like our MSG Sports business, the online operations relating to our teams may, in certain circumstances, be subject to certain agreements, rules, policies, regulations and directives of the leagues in which the respective team operates. See “— Our Business — Regulation.” In addition to driving ticket sales to our events, this interactive business generates revenue for the Company’s segments via the sale of advertising and sponsorships on these digital properties. Additionally, it offers strategic marketing assets that create opportunities to market directly to our fans and cross-promote our businesses.
Other Investments
We continue to explore additional opportunities that strengthen our existing position within the sports and entertainment landscape and/or allow us to exploit our assets and core competencies for growth.
In August 2013, the Company, in a partnership with the owners of Brooklyn Bowl, invested in building a venue in Las Vegas. See “Part II — Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments in Nonconsolidated Affiliates” for further discussion.
In September 2013, the Company acquired a 50% interest in AMSGE. The AMSGE entity owns and operates businesses in the entertainment industry and is currently focused on music management, performance rights, strategic marketing and venue management consulting services. This strategic partnership brings together the expertise and capabilities of each partner with the goal of jointly entering into attractive new businesses that generate revenue and cash flow. AMSGE currently has a controlling interest in both Full Stop Management LLC., its core music management business, and Global Music Rights, a performance rights company. In addition, AMSGE has a non-controlling interest in Oak View Group, Digital Brand Architects, Burns Entertainment and On Board Experiential Marketing. AMSGE will remain focused on capitalizing on investment opportunities within its existing businesses as well as on others in its pipeline, with the goal of accelerating its revenue growth.
In March 2014, the Company acquired a 50% interest in Tribeca Enterprises, the company that owns and operates the acclaimed Tribeca Film Festival, bringing together two of New York’s most important cultural and entertainment icons to enhance the reach and impact of both brands. Now in its 17th year, the annual Film Festival celebrates storytelling in a variety of forms – from film to television to virtual reality, music and gaming. The Festival supports emerging and established voices, discovers award-winning filmmakers, curates innovative and interactive experiences, and introduces new technology and ideas through panels, premieres, exhibitions, and live performance. Tribeca Enterprises’ businesses also include Tribeca Studios, a branded entertainment content business that has produced award-winning stories, and year-round live events. This joint venture augments our portfolio of premier New York City live entertainment brands, while also providing us with a high-profile entry into the festival business, with a team that has created one of the most successful festivals in the world. 
In July 2014, MSG Networks completed the sale of Fuse to SiTV Media, Inc., which has since been renamed Fuse Media, Inc., the parent company of NUVOtv. NUVOtv is an English language entertainment network created for modern Latinos. As part of the transaction, MSG Networks received a 15% equity interest in SiTV Media, LLC, which has since been renamed Fuse Media, LLC (“Fuse Media”), and such equity interest was transferred to the Company in connection with the Distribution. See “Part II — Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments in Nonconsolidated Affiliates” for further discussion.
In August 2016, the Company acquired an approximately 12% common equity stake in Townsquare Media, Inc., a leading media, entertainment and digital marketing solutions company that, like us, believes in the value of creating communities around shared experiences and compelling content. 
In addition to the investments discussed above, the Company also has other investments in various sports and entertainment companies and related technologies, accounted for either under the cost method or equity method.

Garden of Dreams Foundation
Our Company has a close association with The Garden of Dreams Foundation (the “Foundation”), a 501(c)(3) non-profit charity that is dedicated to making dreams come true for children facing obstacles. The Foundation works with 28 partner organizations throughout the tristate area, including hospitals, wish organizations and community-based organizations, to reach children who are facing challenges such as homelessness, extreme poverty, illness and foster care. Since it began in 2006, Garden of Dreams has used the magic of The Madison Square Garden Company — including the Rangers, Knicks, Liberty, Rockettes and famed showplaces — to brighten the lives of nearly 375,000 children and their families. The Foundation takes pride in its commitment to truly change lives, hosting more than 500 events and programs each year. They include: events with the Knicks, Rangers and Liberty; special celebrations and event attendance at The Garden, Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre; visits by Madison Square Garden celebrities; The Garden of Dreams Talent Show, where children perform on the Great Stage at Radio City Music Hall; The Garden of Dreams Prom, which brings together teens who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend their own proms; toy drives; and the “Make A Dream Come True Program,” where children enjoy unforgettable experiences with celebrities and at events. In addition, through its Garden of Dreams Giving program, the Foundation helps its partner organizations meet the critical needs of the children they serve through direct support of scholarships and tangible, targeted community projects. To date, the Foundation has awarded scholarships to 60 children. Garden of Dreams has also served its partners by refurbishing pediatric wards at area hospitals, activity rooms and gymnasiums at community facilities and by creating brand new spaces such as music and dance studios — with plans for many more vital civic enhancements in the years to come.
Regulation
Our sports and entertainment businesses are subject to legislation governing the sale and resale of tickets and consumer protection statutes generally.
In addition, our venues, like all public spaces, are subject to building and health codes and fire regulations imposed by the state and local governments in the jurisdictions in which they are located. Our venues are also subject to zoning and outdoor advertising regulations, and, with respect to Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre, landmark regulations which restrict us from making certain modifications to our facilities as of right or from operating certain types of businesses. Our venues also require a number of licenses in order for us to operate, including occupancy permits, exhibition licenses, food and beverage permits, liquor licenses and other authorizations and, with respect to The Garden, a zoning special permit granted by the New York City Planning Commission. In the jurisdictions in which our venues are located, we are subject to statutes that generally provide that serving alcohol to a visibly intoxicated or minor patron is a violation of the law and may provide for strict liability for certain damages arising out of such violations. In addition, our venues are subject to the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires us to maintain certain accessibility features at each of our facilities. We and our venues are also subject to environmental laws and regulations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — General Risks — We Are Subject to Extensive Governmental Regulation and Our Failure to Comply with These Regulations May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.” The professional sports leagues in which we operate, primarily the NBA and NHL, have the right under certain circumstances to regulate important aspects of our sports business and our team-related online and mobile businesses. See “— Our Business — MSG Sports — The Role of the Leagues in Our Operations.”
Our sports and entertainment businesses are also subject to certain regulations applicable to our Internet web sites and mobile applications. We maintain various web sites and mobile applications that provide information and content regarding our businesses, offer merchandise and tickets for sale, make available sweepstakes and/or contests and offer hospitality services. The operation of these web sites and applications may be subject to a range of federal, state and local laws such as privacy and protection of personal information, accessibility for persons with disabilities and consumer protection regulations. In addition, to the extent any of our web sites collect information from children under 13 years of age or are intended primarily for children under 13 years of age, we must comply with certain limits on commercial matter.
Our businesses are also subject to regulation regarding working conditions and minimum wage requirements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Entertainment Business — Increases in Labor Costs Could Slow the Growth of or Harm TAO Group.”
Our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries in which they operate, as well as international bodies, such as the European Union. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to, among other things, foreign privacy and data protection, currency and repatriation of funds, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. These laws and regulations apply to the activities of the Company and, in some cases, to individual directors, officers, and employees of the Company and agents acting on our behalf. Certain of these laws impose stringent requirements on how we can conduct our foreign operations and place restrictions on our business and partnering activities.

Competition
Competition in Our Sports Business
Our sports business operates in a market in which numerous sports and entertainment opportunities are available. In addition to the NBA, NHL, WNBA, AHL and NBAGL teams that we own and operate, the New York City metropolitan area is home to two Major League Baseball teams (the New York Yankees (the “Yankees”) and the New York Mets (the “Mets”)), two National Football League teams (the New York Giants (the “Giants”) and the New York Jets (the “Jets”)), two additional NHL teams (the New York Islanders (the “Islanders”) and the New Jersey Devils (the “Devils”)), a second NBA team (the Brooklyn Nets (the “Nets”) and two Major League Soccer franchises (the New York Red Bulls and the New York City Football Club). In addition, there are a number of other amateur and professional teams that compete in other sports, including at the collegiate and minor league levels. New York is also home to the U.S. Open tennis event each summer, as well as many other non-sports related entertainment options.
As a result of the large number of options available, we face strong competition for the New York area sports fan. We must compete with these other sporting events in varying respects and degrees, including on the basis of the quality of the teams we field, their success in the leagues in which they compete, our ability to provide an entertaining environment at our games and the prices we charge for our tickets. In addition, for fans who prefer the unique experience of NHL hockey, we must compete with the Islanders and Devils as well as, in varying respects and degrees, with other NHL hockey teams and the NHL itself. Similarly, for those fans attracted to the equally unique experience of NBA basketball, we must compete with the Nets as well as, in varying respects and degrees, with other NBA teams and the NBA itself. In addition, we also compete to varying degrees with other productions and live entertainment events for advertising and sponsorship dollars. 
The amount of revenue we earn is influenced by many factors, including the popularity and on-court or on-ice performance of our sports teams and general economic conditions. In particular, when our sports teams have strong on-court and on-ice performance, we benefit from increased demand for tickets, potentially greater food and merchandise sales from increased attendance and increased sponsorship opportunities. When our sports teams qualify for the playoffs, we also benefit from the attendance and in-game spending at the playoff games. The year-to-year impact of team performance is somewhat moderated by the fact that a significant portion of our revenue derives from rights fees, suite rental fees and sponsorship and signage revenue, all of which are generally contracted on a multi-year basis. Nevertheless, the long-term performance of our business is tied to the success and popularity of our sports teams and our ability to attract other compelling sports content.
In July 2017, we acquired a controlling interest in CLG, a premier North American esports organization. Due to the nature of esports, CLG competes with other teams across North America and globally. CLG competes for sponsorship, merchandise rights, media rights, and event prize winnings. Esports teams vary in their amount of funding, size of existing business, and amount of social following, among other factors, which can impact our ability to compete effectively.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Sports Business — Our Sports Business Faces Intense and Wide-Ranging Competition, Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations” and “— Our Businesses Are Substantially Dependent on the Continued Popularity and/or Competitive Success of the Knicks and Rangers, Which Cannot Be Assured.”
Competition in Our Entertainment Business
Our entertainment business competes, in certain respects and to varying degrees, with other live performances, sporting events, movies, home entertainment (including the Internet and online services, television, video and gaming devices), restaurants and nightlife venues, and the large number of other entertainment and public attraction options available to members of the public. Our businesses typically represent alternative uses for the public’s entertainment dollars. The primary geographic area in which we operate, New York City, is among the most competitive entertainment markets in the world, with the world’s largest live theater industry and extensive performing arts venues, 12 major professional sports teams, thousands of restaurants and nightlife venues, numerous museums, galleries and other attractions, and numerous movie theaters available to the public. We also have significant operations in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Our venues and live offerings outside of New York City similarly compete with other entertainment, dining and nightlife options in their respective markets and elsewhere. We compete with these other entertainment options on the basis of the quality of our productions, the public’s interest in our content, the price of our tickets, the quality, location and atmosphere, including the nature and condition of the setting, of our venues, our service, the price, quality and presentation of our food and the overall experience we provide.
We compete for bookings with a large number of other venues both in the cities in which our venues are located and in alternative locations capable of booking the same productions and events. Generally, we compete for bookings on the basis of the size, quality, expense and nature of the venue required for the booking. Some of our competitors may have a larger network of venues and/or greater financial resources.
14

In addition to competition for ticket sales and bookings, we also compete to varying degrees with other productions and sporting events for advertising and sponsorship dollars.
See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Entertainment Business — Our Entertainment Business Faces Intense and Wide-Ranging Competition Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations,” “— The Success of Our Entertainment Business Depends on the Continued Popularity of Our Live Productions, Particularly the Christmas Spectacular, the Decline of Which Could Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations” and “ — Negative Publicity with Respect to Any of the Existing or Future TAO Group Brands Could Reduce Sales at One or More of the Existing or Future TAO Group Venues and Make the TAO Group Brands Less Valuable, Which Could Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.”
Employees
As of June 30, 2018 we had approximately 2,900 full-time union and non-union employees and 8,800 part-time union and non-union employees. Approximately 58% of our employees were represented by unions as of June 30, 2018. Approximately 24% of such union employees are subject to CBAs that expired as of June 30, 2018 and approximately 16% are subject to CBAs that will expire by June 30, 2019 if they are not extended prior thereto. Labor relations in general and in the sports and entertainment industry in particular can be volatile, though our current relationships with our unions taken as a whole are positive. We have from time to time faced labor action or had to make contingency plans because of threatened or potential labor actions.
The NHL players and the NBA players are covered by CBAs between the NHL Players’ Association (“NHLPA”) and the NHL and between the National Basketball Players Association (“NBPA”) and the NBA, respectively. Both the NHL and the NBA have experienced labor difficulties in the past and may have labor issues in the future.
