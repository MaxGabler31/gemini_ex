ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview and Corporate History

Since April 2021, the Company’s business model is focused on developing and commercializing therapeutics that treat rare and infectious diseases, specifically in populations that are neglected or face adherence challenges due to inconvenient dosing or delivery system, tolerability, or cost and accessibility of available therapeutic options. Under certain license and commercial agreements with CytoDyn, Inc. (“CytoDyn”) described more fully below, the Company’s primary asset is the commercial rights to leronlimab (also known as “PRO 140”) in all human immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”) indications within the United States. HIV is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system. If HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Leronlimab is a monoclonal antibody C—C chemokine receptor type 5 (“CCR5”) antagonist, meaning it is designed to prevent HIV from entering human cells. Leronlimab is the subject of a current Biologics License Application (“BLA”) that has been submitted in part to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) with an indication to treat Multi-Drug Resistant HIV infection, with the potential for multiple additional therapeutic indications in HIV. As of the date of this report, the FDA’s review of the BLA is ongoing. The names “leronlimab” and “PRO 140” are used interchangeably throughout this report. 

Regnum Corp. was incorporated on March 31, 2016 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We were initially formed for the primary business purpose of servicing the increasing demand for premium entertainment content and becoming a depository of unpublished intellectual properties for resale with a focus on achieving profitability and sustaining business growth. Our business model was, until April 2021 based on acquiring unproduced and unpublished quality intellectual properties at a discount from studios, agencies, and production companies, for subsequent recycling or production in a wide variety of media, with the intent to resell such works back to the entertainment community. 

Recent Transactions and Changes of Control

On April 7, 2021, Wookey Search Technologies Corporation (herein “Wookey”), the previous majority shareholder of the Company, entered into a stock purchase agreement for the sale of 20,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), to Phoenixus AG (“Phoenixus”), a Swiss holding company which (through its subsidiaries) operates a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focusing on patients with unmet medical needs. Phoenixus was previously led by Martin Shkreli (“Shkreli”), who for the past several years has been subject to several civil and criminal actions related his activities (not related to the Company) in the pharmaceutical industry. Mr. Shkreli is presently in prison serving a sentence for his crimes, and by court actions, he has effectively been stripped of his ability to control Phoenixus. Mr. Shkreli’s equity interest in Phoenixus is presently in the process of being sold by a receiver in order to satisfy certain monetary damages owed by Mr. Shkreli arising out of such legal proceedings. 

As part of the April 2021 transactions, Phoenixus also acquired an additional 2,680,000 shares of Common Stock from three minority shareholders. In connection with the sale of such shares, an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock held by Gary Allen (a former director of the Company) were returned to the Company for cancellation. The acquisition by Phoenixus of 22,680,000 shares of Common Stock and the cancellation of the 1,000,000 shares previously held by Mr. Allen resulted in a change in control of the Company. Phoenixus now holds approximately 99% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, and as such it is able to unilaterally control the election of our board of directors, all matters upon which shareholder approval is required and, for the foreseeable future, will exert near total influence over our business and affairs.

Also, on April 7, 2021, Mark Gustavson, former Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Director of the Company, and Ross Meador, former Vice President and General Counsel of the Company, resigned from their positions with the Company. Upon such resignations, Anne Kirby was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, President, and sole Director. Robert Stubblefield remained in position of the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, serving in a consulting capacity.

On May 13, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with SevenScore Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“SevenScore”). SevenScore is a subsidiary of Phoenixus. Subsequently, the merger was terminated on September 1, 2021 by mutual agreement of the Company and SevenScore. 

The Company has submitted a Company Related Action Notification, in accordance with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) Rule 6490 (the “Corporate Action Notice”) on October 20, 2021, in connection with a proposed change of the Company’s name to “Rovida Therapeutics, Inc.” and change the Company’s trading symbol, as well as to redomicile of the Company from the state of Nevada to the state of Delaware. The Corporate Actions have been approved by the board of directors of the Company on October 21, 2021, and was approved by consent of Phoenixus as majority stockholder on October 21, 2021. The Company has been in discussions with FINRA regarding the Corporate Action Notice, and anticipates to effectuate the corporate name change, redomestication, and symbol change immediately following FINRA’s approval of the Corporate Action Notice. However, and in particular due to Mr. Shkreli’s association with Phoenixus and Phoenixus’ status as our controlling shareholder, no assurances can be given that the Corporate Action Notice will be approved by FINRA.

Planned Commercialization of Leronlimab and Other Company Activities

Vyera Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a subsidiary of Phoenixus (“Vyera”), acquired the marketing rights from CytoDyn for leronlimab in all HIV related indications through the Commercialization and License Agreement (“CLA”) entered into on December 17, 2019, the terms of which are described below. These rights were later assigned from Vyera to SevenScore and thereafter to the Company on January 3, 2022.

The preclinical and clinical development of PRO 140 was led by Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Progenics”) through 2011. CytoDyn acquired PRO 140 from Progenics in October 2012. In February 2018, CytoDyn announced they had met the primary endpoint in its Phase 3 trial for leronlimab as a combination therapy with highly active antiretroviral therapy (known as HAART) for highly treatment experienced HIV patients and filed the non-clinical portion of the BLA to FDA in March 2019. CytoDyn filed the clinical and manufacturing portions of the BLA to FDA in April and May of 2020, respectively. In July 2020, CytoDyn received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding the BLA filing. In November 2021, CytoDyn resubmitted the non-clinical and manufacturing sections of the BLA and continues to work on the clinical section of the BLA. The preclinical and clinical development of PRO 140 was led by Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Progenics”) through 2011. CytoDyn acquired PRO 140 from Progenics in October 2012. In February 2018, CytoDyn announced they had met the primary endpoint in its Phase 3 trial for leronlimab as a combination therapy with highly active antiretroviral therapy (known as HAART) for highly treatment experienced HIV patients and filed the non-clinical portion of the BLA to FDA in March 2019. CytoDyn filed the clinical and manufacturing portions of the BLA to FDA in April and May of 2020, respectively. In July 2020, CytoDyn received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding the BLA filing. In November 2021, CytoDyn resubmitted the non-clinical and manufacturing sections of the BLA and continues to work on the clinical section of the BLA.

On March 30, 2022, CytoDyn announced the FDA placed a partial hold on their HIV clinical program in the United States. Under the partial hold, no clinical studies may be initiated or resumed until the partial clinical hold is resolved. As a result of the partial clinical hold on the HIV program, patients currently enrolled in the extension trials will be transitioned to other available therapeutics. The Company is current assessing the impact of this partial clinical hold on the timeline for potential FDA approval of leronlimab.

Prior to the announcement of the partial clinical hold, the Company was focused on preparing for the commercialization of leronlimab for Multi-Drug Resistant HIV. Efforts included the development of marketing strategies and market access plans, establishing strategic partnerships with specialty pharmacies and patient services companies, and headcount planning. While the Company is assessing the impact of the partial clinical hold, the Company also focusing its efforts on in-licensing or otherwise acquiring other developmental or commercial stage pharmaceutical therapeutics that treat rare and infectious diseases. The Company expects to resume pre-commercialization launch activities for leronlimab once CytoDyn has filed the clinical section of the BLA.

Overview of Leronlimab

Leronlimab as a CCR5 Antagonist

The Company’s main focus is commercialization of leronlimab, subject to approval by the FDA. If approved by FDA under the indications provided for in the current BLA, leronlimab could be used as a platform drug for a variety of HIV indications. The target of leronlimab is the immunologic receptor CCR5. Leronlimab prevents certain strains of HIV from using the CCR5 receptor as an entry gateway for healthy cells. 

Leronlimab binds to the second extracellular loop and N-terminus of the CCR5 receptor, and due to its selectivity and target-specific mechanism of action, leronlimab does not appear to activate the immune function of the CCR5 receptor through agonist activity. This apparent target specificity differentiates leronlimab from other CCR5 antagonists.

Leronlimab and HIV

The leronlimab antibody belongs to a class of HIV therapies known as entry inhibitors that block HIV from entering into and infecting certain cells. Leronlimab blocks HIV from entering a cell by binding to a molecule called CCR5, a normal cell surface receptor protein to which certain strains of HIV, referred to as “R5” strains, attach as part of HIV’s entry into a cell. Leronlimab has shown promise in phase 3 clinical studies as an antiviral agent. In these clinical studies, leronlimab was compared to optimized background therapies chosen on the basis of a subject’s resistance test results and treatment history. Leronlimab demonstrated significant plasma HIV-1 RNA reduction, as compared to optimized background therapies alone. 

Leronlimab does not appear to appear to affect the normal immune function of the CCR5 co-receptor for HIV. Instead, leronlimab binds to a precise site on CCR5 that R5 strains of HIV use to enter the cell and, in doing so, inhibits the ability of these strains of HIV to infect the cell without appearing to affect the cell’s normal function. As a result, we believe leronlimab represents a distinct class of CCR5 inhibitors with advantageous virological and immunological properties and may provide a unique tool to treat HIV infected patients.

To date, leronlimab has been tested and administered to patients predominantly as a subcutaneous injection. We believe that if leronlimab is approved by the FDA for use as an injectable treatment for HIV, it may be an attractive and marketable therapeutic option for patients, particularly in the following scenarios:


· | Patients with difficulty adhering to daily drug regimens; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Patients who poorly tolerate existing therapies; 
· | Patients with compromised organ function, such as hepatitis C (“HCV”) co-infection; and
· | Patients with complex concomitant medical requirements. 


Clinical trials for leronlimab have demonstrated potent antiretroviral activity (as compared to optimized background therapy alone) with the advantage of less frequent dosing requirements. 

CytoDyn’s ongoing HIV-related clinical trials (which are presently on partial clinical hold, as described above) have been designed to demonstrate the proof of concept that leronlimab monotherapy can continue to suppress the viral load in certain HIV-infected, treatment-experienced patients who had suppressed viral load on HAART, but would like an alternative treatment that provides a higher quality of life with one dose through a weekly self-injection. Once the viral load is undetectable, administration of leronlimab can help maintain the suppressed viral load in a subpopulation of R5 patients over an extended period of time (currently shown to be in excess of six years).

Competition

The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our commercial efforts may compete with more established biotechnology companies that have significantly greater financial and managerial resources than we do.

We face competition from both very large, multi-national corporations with significant resources, and small start-up organizations. Our potential competitors include entities that develop and produce therapeutic agents. These include numerous public and private academic and research organizations and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies pursuing production of, among other things, biologics from cell cultures, genetically engineered drugs and natural and chemically synthesized drugs. Our competitors may succeed in developing potential drugs or processes that are more effective or less costly than any that may be marketed by us or that gain regulatory approval prior to our potential drug candidates. Worldwide, there are many antiviral drugs for treatment of HIV. The Company will face competition from established pharmaceutical companies. Many of these potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources, management expertise, research and development capabilities, manufacturing and marketing resources and experience than we do.

Leronlimab blocks a cell receptor called CCR5, which is the entry point for most strains of HIV virus. ViiV Healthcare’s Selzentry® (maraviroc) is the only currently FDA approved CCR5 blocking agent. Maraviroc must be taken daily and is believed to have side effects and toxicity. For these reasons, we believe that leronlimab, a monoclonal antibody, may prove to be useful in patients that cannot tolerate existing HIV therapies or desire a respite from those therapies. Nonetheless, manufacturers of current therapies, such as Gilead Sciences, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb and ViiV Healthcare, are very large, multi-national corporations with significant resources. We expect that these companies will compete fiercely to defend and expand their market share.

To construct a HAART regimen, three drugs from two classes of drugs are typically needed. Currently there are only five different classes of drugs from which four are primarily used to construct a HAART regimen. Each of these four classes of drugs has many drugs available in its respective class, except the entry inhibitor (“EI”) class, which has only four drugs available. 

Commercialization and License Agreement and Supply Agreement with CytoDyn

Commercialization and License Agreement

On January 3, 2022, the Company, CytoDyn, and SevenScore entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement (“Assignment”) of the Commercialization and License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) and a Supply Agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) executed between Vyera and CytoDyn on December 17, 2019. Through the Assignment, the Company acquired the exclusive right to commercialize pharmaceutical preparations containing leronlimab for treatment of HIV in humans (the “Field”) in the United States (the “Territory”). In exchange for these agreements SevenScore receives 4,094,023 shares of Common Stock.

Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Company will bear the cost of, and be responsible for, among other things, commercializing leronlimab in the Territory and will use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize leronlimab in the Field in the Territory. Under the terms of the License Agreement, CytoDyn is permitted to license leronlimab outside of the Territory for uses in the Field or outside the Field or inside the Territory for uses outside of the Field.

The Company is obligated to pay CytoDyn potential milestone payments upon certain regulatory and sales-based milestones as follows: $500,000 due upon BLA acceptance, up to $250,000 upon FDA approval and $1,000,000 upon first sale of leronlimab. In addition, during the term of the License Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay CytoDyn a royalty equal to 50% of the Company’s gross profit margin from leronlimab sales (defined in the License Agreement as “Net Sales”) in the Territory. The royalty is subject to reduction during the Royalty Term (as defined below) after patent expiry and expiry of regulatory exclusivity. Following expiration of the Royalty Term, the Company will continue to maintain non-exclusive rights to commercialize leronlimab.

The License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the Royalty Term. The “Royalty Term” means the period beginning on the date of the first commercial sale of leronlimab and ends on the latest of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of the patents covering leronlimab, (ii) ten years after the first commercial sale of leronlimab, (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for leronlimab and (iv) the Biosimilar Entry Date (as defined in the License Agreement). The License Agreement may be terminated by either party for material breach, upon a party’s insolvency or bankruptcy, or for a safety concern or clinical failure.

The Company has the right to terminate the License Agreement (i) on or after the second anniversary of the effective date of the License Agreement upon written notice to CytoDyn in the event the approval (“Regulatory Approval”) by the FDA of the BLA for the manufacture and sale of leronlimab in the Territory for the Initial Indication (as defined in the License Agreement) has not been received by such second anniversary, (ii) if the Company fails to achieve certain aggregate Net Sales (as defined in the License Agreement) of leronlimab during the period beginning on the date of first commercial sale and ending on the date that is two years from the date of the first commercial sale, and (iii) at the Company’s convenience following the second anniversary of the first commercial sale of leronlimab with 180 days’ written notice.

The License Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants by both parties, as well as customary provisions relating to indemnification, confidentiality, and other matters.

Supply Agreement

Pursuant to the Supply Agreement, CytoDyn has agreed to supply to quantities of leronlimab to the Company for commercialization under the License Agreement. The Supply Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including representations and warranties relating to compliance of leronlimab with specifications and applicable governmental rules and covenants with respect to the rejection of delivered product and non-conforming product, product recalls and regulatory communications.

The Supply Agreement will expire at the expiration of the Royalty Term, provided that the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to extend the term of the Supply Agreement for so long as the Company agrees to continue to pay CytoDyn an agreed-upon royalty payment.

Intellectual Property

Protection of the Company’s and CytoDyn’s intellectual property rights is important to the Company’s business. CytoDyn’s patents, which are subject of the Commercialization and License Agreement, are referenced as Exhibit A thereto, included as an exhibit on this Report. Through the agreement with CytoDyn, the Company will leverage CytoDyn’s existing leronlimab intellectual property to commercialize the product.

We may also file patent applications in the U.S., Canada, China, and Japan, as well as in European countries that are party to the European Patent Convention and other countries on a selective basis in order to protect inventions we consider to be important to the development of our business. 

Generally, patents issued in the U.S. are effective for either (i) 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date, if the application was filed on or after June 8, 1995, or (ii) the longer of 17 years from the date of issue or 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date, if the application was filed prior to that date. A U.S. patent, to be selected by the grantee upon receipt of FDA regulatory approval, may be subject to up to a five-year patent term extension in certain instances. While the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law, most countries provide for a patent term of 20 years measured from the application filing date and some may also allow for patent term extension to compensate for regulatory approval delay. We pursue opportunities for seeking new meaningful patent protection on an ongoing basis. 

Government Regulation

The research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, labeling, storage, record-keeping, distribution, import, export, promotion, advertising, marketing, sale, pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory requirements, both pre-approval and post-approval, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The regulatory requirements applicable to product development, approval and marketing are subject to change, and regulations and administrative guidance often are revised or reinterpreted by the agencies in ways that may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.

Licensure and Regulation of Biological Products in the United States

In the United States, the FDA regulates human drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), and in the case of biological products, also under the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”), and their implementing regulations. We believe that our products will be regulated as biological products, or biologics. The failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may result in FDA refusal to approve pending BLAs or delays in development and may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as issuance of warning letters, or the imposition of fines, civil penalties, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or civil or criminal prosecution brought by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice or other governmental entities.

The FDA must approve our product candidates for therapeutic indications before they may be marketed in the United States. For biologic products, the FDA must approve a BLA. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps:  


· | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulations or other applicable regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated when certain changes are made; 
· | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), or ethics committee representing each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practices (“GCPs”) and other clinical-trial related regulations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
· | preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA requesting marketing approval for one or more proposed indications, including payment of application user fees; 
· | review of the BLA by an FDA advisory committee, where applicable; 
· | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the biologic is produced to assess compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
· | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data submitted in support of the BLA; and 
· | FDA review and approval of the BLA, which may be subject to additional post- approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS, and any post- approval studies required by the FDA. 

Manufacturing

The Company does not own or operate manufacturing facilities responsible for the production of leronlimab. As such, the Company must depend on CytoDyn and its third-party manufacturing organizations and suppliers for all of our commercial grade quantities of leronlimab.
Employees

As of December 31, 2021, we had two executive officers, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, and no other employees. Our Chief Executive Officer (who is also currently the sole member of our Board of Directors) provides services to us pursuant to shared services agreements described elsewhere in this Report. Our Chief Financial Officer provides services pursuant to a Consulting Agreement described elsewhere in this Report. The Company has several independent consultants available to assist the Company with the commercial launch of leronlimab, should the BLA be approved. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to identify, attract and retain qualified employees or consultants on acceptable terms in the future.
