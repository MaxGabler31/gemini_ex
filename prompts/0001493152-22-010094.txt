Company Background
 
Oncotelic Therapeutics, Inc. (f/k/a Mateon Therapeutics, Inc.) (“Oncotelic”), was formed in the State of New York in 1988 as OXiGENE, Inc., was reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 1992, and changed its name to Mateon Therapeutics, Inc. in 2016, and Oncotelic Therapeutics, Inc. in November 2020. Oncotelic conducts business activities through Oncotelic and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Oncotelic, Inc., a Delaware corporation, PointR Data, Inc. (“PointR”), a Delaware corporation, and EdgePoint AI, Inc. (“Edgepoint”), a Delaware Corporation for which there are non-controlling interests, (Oncotelic, Oncotelic Inc., PointR and Edgepoint are collectively called the “Company” or “We”). The Company is currently developing OT-101 for various cancers and COVID-19, Artemisinin for COVID-19 and AI technologies for clinical development and manufacturing. The Company has acquired apomorphine for Parkinson’s Disease, erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction. In addition, the Company is evaluating the further development of its product candidates OXi4503 as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes and CA4P in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma. Our principal corporate office is in the United States at 29397 Agoura Road, Suite 107, Agoura Hills, CA 91301 (telephone: 650-635-7000). Our internet address is www.oncotelic.com.
 
Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation
 
In November 2020 the Company filed an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware changing its name from “Mateon Therapeutics, Inc.” to “Oncotelic Therapeutics, Inc.” A notice of corporate action had been filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), requesting confirmation to change its name and approval for a new ticker symbol. On March 29, 2021, the Company received approval from FINRA on its notice of corporate action, and effective March 30, 2021, the Company’s ticker symbol has changed from “MATN” to “OTLC”.
 
In January 2021, the Company filed an additional amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Charter Amendment”), with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware, which Charter Amendment went effective immediately upon acceptance by the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware. As approved by the Company’s stockholders by written consent on August 10, 2020, the Charter Amendment increased the number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 150,000,000 shares to 750,000,000 shares.
 
In addition, the Company registered an additional total of 20,000,000 shares of its Common Stock, which may be issued pursuant to the Company’s Amended and Restated 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). Such additional shares were approved by the shareholders of the Company on August 10, 2020 and as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on a Current Report on Form 8-K on August 14, 2020. As such, the total number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock available for issuance under the 2015 plan is 27,250,000.
 
Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing drugs for the treatment of orphan oncology indications, developing antisense and small molecule injectable drugs for the treatment of cancer. After the acquisition of Mateon Therapeutics, Inc through a reverse merger in 2019, we realigned the company pipeline to focus on rare pediatric cancers. The United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted us Rare Pediatric Designations (“RPD”) for pediatric Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (“DIPG”) for OT-101, pediatric melanoma for CAP4 and acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) for Oxi4503. This strategy aims to capitalize on a voucher program in the United States (“US”). By focusing on RPD we anticipate: 1) reducing the cost of clinical development by way of a smaller and faster clinical trial, 2) acceleration of the approval process and final approval, 3) obtaining regulatory/ marketing exclusivity for up to 12 years as a biologic, and 4) obtaining vouchers worth a significantly large value on regulatory approval, which can be upwards of several million dollars. Approval in US would allow for approval in the rest of the world (“ROW”) using the US dossier. Phase 3 clinical trials for approval in adult indications will be conducted following the positive interim read of the pediatric trials. This approach maximize return on investment for the shareholders.
 
Concurrently we also explore opportunity to create values for shareholders by forming strategic alliances and/or licensing our product portfolio. As of August 2021, we have been working on the formation of a joint venture (“JV”) with Golden Mountain Partners (“GMP”) to transfer the developmental cost of our product(s) onto the JV, while still participating in potential upside through ownership of the JV. The Company entered into a JV with Dragon Overseas Capital Limited (“Dragon Overseas”) and GMP Biotechnology Limited (“GMP Bio”), affiliates of GMP on March 31, 2022. GMP Bio and the Company are also looking to take the JV into an initial public offering (“IPO”) of the JV and which is anticipated to be a liquidity event for Company, especially if the IPO is successful. While we believe that the JV and the IPO can be completed and be successful, we cannot provide assurance for either of the events to occur; or if they occur, then they would be successful.
 
As a result of the reverse merger of Oncotelic and Oncotelic Inc.in April 2019 and the acquisition of PointR in November 2019, respectively, we believe we are well positioned as a biotech company with: (1) Oncotelic Inc.’s antisense platform with our drug candidate OT-101- targeting high value TGF-β2 target for various cancers and COVID-19, (2) PointR artificial intelligence (“AI”) for clinical trials, research and development, (3) Edgepoint for developing technologies for manufacturing and for developing technologies for supporting our COVID-19 programs, (4) Artemisinin for COVID-19, (5) the Company’s vascular disruptor proven safe in more than 500 patients capable of causing massive antigen release which would stimulate immune response against the cancerous tumor and (6) apomorphine, which we in-licensed in 2021, for developing against Parkinson’s Disease (“PD”), erectile disfunction (“ED”) and female sexual disfunction (“FSD”). Since the JV is formed with GMP Bio, we will now plan to accelerate the development of apomorphine as our flagship drug candidate.

We are also developing OT-101, an antisense against TGF-β2 – for the treatment of various viruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (“SARS”) and the current coronavirus (“COVID-19”), on its own and in conjunction with other compounds. Viral replication cannot occur without TGF-β; and TGF-β surge and a cytokine storm cannot occur without TGF-β. A Phase 2 trial was completed for OT-101 in South America. Based on the final results of the trial, the trial can expand into a Phase 3 trial if the data supports the safety of the drug. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OT-101 in adult patients hospitalized with positive COVID-19 and pneumonia.
 
In addition, during 2020 and 2021, the Company was developing Artemisinin as a potential therapy for the virus causing COVID-19 (“SARS-CoV-2”). Artemisinin, purified from a plant Artemisia annua. It can inhibit TGF-β activity and is able to neutralize COVID-19. The Company initially conducted a study and the test results during an in vitro study at Utah State University showed Artemisinin having an EC50 of 0.45 ug/ml, and a Safety Index of 140. Artemisinin can target multiple viral threats, including COVID-19, by suppressing both viral replication and clinical symptoms that arise from viral infection. Viral replication cannot occur without TGF-β. In a clinical study undertaken in India called ARTI-19, clinical consequences related to the TGF-β surge, including ARDS and cytokine storm, were suppressed by targeting TGF-β with Artemisinin. The ARTI-19 trials were conducted in India by Windlas Biotech Limited (“Windlas”), the Company’s business partner in India. Windlas had applied for regulatory approval for it’s Artemisinin based product, ArtiShieldTM, but has not been able to obtain regulatory approval for use of ArtiShieldTM as a COVID-19 therapy and as such, no significant revenues have been reported by Windlas nor have we accrued any royalties on Artemisinin due from Windlas. We intend to focus future development on Artemisinin against other respiratory viruses with unmet needs.
 
In September 2021, Oncotelic entered into an exclusive License Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Autotelic, Inc. (“Autotelic”), pursuant to which Autotelic granted Oncotelic, among other things: (i) the exclusive right and license to certain Autotelic Patents (as defined in the Agreement) and Autotelic Know-How (as defined in the Agreement); and (ii) a right of first refusal to acquire at least a majority of the outstanding capital stock of Autotelic prior to Autotelic entering into any transaction that is a financing collaboration, distribution revenues, earn-outs, sales, out-licensing, purchases, debt, royalties, merger acquisition, change of control, transfer of cash or non-cash assets, disposition of capital stock by way of tender or exchange offer, partnership or any other joint or collaborative venture, research collaboration, material transfer, sponsored research or similar transaction or agreements. In exchange for the rights granted to Oncotelic, Autotelic will be entitled to earn the milestone payments. This transaction brings in AL-101 - an intranasal apomorphine asset with clear 505(b)2 pathway to approval for PD as well unique mechanism of action for treatment of ED and FSD. 
 
We currently have eight primary drug and AI technology programs we are seeking to advance:
 

● | Intranasal drug and delivery system for intra-nasal Apomorphine for the treatment of PD, ED and FSD. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | OT-101 - an antisense against TGF-β2 – for the treatment of solid tumors with focus on brain cancer in adult and DIPG in children. A RPD for pediatric DIPG has been granted by US FDA. 
● | OT-101 - an antisense against TGF-β2 –for the treatment of various viruses, including the SARS and the current COVID-19, on its own and in conjunction with other compounds. 
● | Artemisinin – a natural derivative from an Asian herb Artemisia Annua - Artemisinin has shown to be highly potent at inhibiting the ability of the COVID-19 causing virus to multiply while also having an excellent safety index as well as against hepatitis B and C viruses, human herpes viruses, HIV-1, influenza virus A, and bovine viral diarrhea virus in the low micromolar range.

AL-101: PD/ ED/FSD
 
Oncotelic acquired AL-101 for the intranasal delivery of apomorphine for the treatment of PD. Over 60,000 new patients being diagnosed with PD in the United States and currently there are over 1 million patients in the US and expected to increase to over 1.2 million by 2030. In addition, approximately 10 million suffer from this disease globally. https://www.parkinson.org/Understanding-Parkinsons/Statistics. AL-101 is also being developed for ED. ED is the most prevalent male sexual disorder globally. The percentages of men affected by ED are as follows: 14.3-70% of men aged 60 years, 6.7-48% of men aged 70 years, and 38% of men aged 80 years (Geerkens MJM et al. (2019). Eur Urol Focus. pii: S2405-4569(19)30079-3). However, with the increasing administration of PDE5 inhibitors in clinical practice, it was found that approximately 30-35% of ED patients are treatment failures (McMahon CN et al. (2006). BMJ, 332: 589-92). AL-101 is designed to target treatment failure ED patients who do not respond to PDE5 inhibitors. Through similar mechanism of action, AL-101 is being developed for FSD. FSD is a prevalent problem, afflicting approximately 40% of women and there are few treatment options. FSD is more typical as women age and is a progressive and widespread condition. (Allahdadi, KJ et al. (2009) Cardiovascular & hematological agents in medicinal chemistry, 7(4), 260-269). There is no available drug for the treatment of FSD. In June 2019, the FDA approved Vyleesi (bremelanotide) to treat acquired, generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (“HSDD”) in premenopausal women. This is the only available drug treatment. Vyleesi has essentially replaced the only other drug for HSDD, however, it has a long list of drug-drug interactions, including commonly used antidepressants, such as fluoxetine and sertraline. In addition, it has a black box warning regarding its use with alcohol, a combination that has been associated with hypotension and syncopal episodes. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective therapy against FSD and HSDD.
OT-101: An Antisense Against TGF-β2
 
Trabedersen (AP12009, OT-101) is a novel antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (“ODN”) developed by Oncotelic Inc. for the treatment of patients with pancreatic carcinoma, malignant melanoma, colorectal carcinoma, high-grade glioma (“HGG”), and other transforming growth factor beta 2 (“TGF-β2”) overexpressing malignancies (e.g. prostate carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, etc.). Trabedersen is a synthetic 18-mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (“S-ODN”) complementary to the messenger ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”) of the human TGF-β2 gene.
 
TGF-β is a multifunctional cytokine with a key role in promoting tumor growth and progression including cell proliferation, cell migration, and angiogenesis. Above all, TGF-β is a highly potent immunosuppressive molecule. Inhibition of TGF-β overexpression in tumor tissue represents a novel multimodal treatment principle leading to the reduction of tumor growth, inhibition of metastasis, and restoration of host antitumor immune responses. Despite its recognized pivotal role in cancer, therapeutics targeting TGF-β have not been successful and many have failed due to toxicity issues possibly due to inhibition of TGF-β1 essential functions. The high level of homology between the various TGF-β isoforms is making it impossible to create mAb or small molecule inhibitor without TGF-β1 cross-inhibition. Therefore, Oncotelic Inc. chose to target TGF-β2 only using OT-101 antisense approach. The sequence of OT-101 can only target TGF-β2 and does not have any impact on other TGF-β isotypes. However, suppression of TGF-β2 directly by OT-101 would also result in suppression of TGF-β2 indirectly, but not TGF-β3.
 
Trabedersen is believed to reverse TGF-β’s immunosuppressive effects, rendering the tumor visible to a patient’s immune system and resulting in priming and specific activation of the patient’s anti-tumor immune response. OT-101 has completed multiple clinical trials with promising outcomes. OT-101, is being developed as a broad-spectrum anti-cancer drug that can also be used in combination with other standard cancer therapies to establish an effective multi-modality treatment strategy for difficult-to-treat cancers. Oncotelic plans to initiate phase 3 clinical trials for OT-101 in both high-grade glioma and pancreatic cancer. During phase 2 clinical trials in pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancers (Study P001) and in high-grade gliomas (Study G004), meaningful single agent activity with meaningful tumor reduction was observed, and OT-101 exhibited a favorable safety profile. Both partial and complete responses have been observed in the G004 Phase 2 clinical trial of OT-101 as a single agent in patients with aggressive brain tumors.

Oncotelic Inc.’s self-immunization protocol (SIP©) is based on the novel and proprietary sequential treatment of cancers with OT-101 (antisense against TGF-β2) and chemotherapies. Proper Sequencing of treatments is key to optimal immunotherapy. Leveraging from its in-depth knowledge of TGF-β immunotherapy, Oncotelic Inc. ordered the various treatments in the following sequence: (1) expand immune reserve through IL-2 treatment or infusion of immune cells; (2) prime immune response with TGF-β inhibitor OT-101; (3) boost immune response with chemotherapy; and (4) revitalize the exhausted of immune response with checkpoint inhibitors. This sequential treatment strategy is aimed at achieving effective self-immunization against a patients’ own cancer, resulting in robust therapeutic immune response and consequently better control of the cancer and improved survival. Prolonged states of being cancer-free have been observed in some patients with the most aggressive forms of cancer, raising a renewed hope for a potential cure. The use of OT-101 lifts the suppression of the patient’s immune cells around the cancer tissue, providing the foundation for an effective initial priming, which is critical for a successful immune response. The subsequent chemotherapy results in the release of neoantigens that result in a robust boost of the immune response. This process is termed Xenogenization process and can be: (1) hypermutation by temozolomide in the treatment of brain cancer, (2) immunogenic cell death by taxanes and 5FU in pancreatic cancer, or (3) necrotic cell death by VDA (vascular disrupting agent) in melanoma and MDS. Additionally, the Company believes that a rational combination of the Oncotelic Inc. SIP platform with immune-modulatory drugs like interleukin 2 (IL-2) and/or immune checkpoint inhibitors has the potential to help achieve sustained and robust immune responses in patients with the most difficult-to-treat forms of cancer. The combinations with IL-2 and NK are already partnered with external corporate partners. The Company entered into a JV with Dragon Overseas Capital Limited (“Dragon Overseas”) and GMP Biotechnology Limited (“GMP Bio”), affiliates of GMP on March 31, 2022. GMP Bio and the Company will focus to further expand the development of OT-101 for various oncology indications like pancreatic cancer, melanomas, gliomas etc. as also for viral infections like COVID-19. This path is being evaluated as a monotherapy, as well as combination therapies in conjunction with other drugs like checkpoint inhibitors.
 
Pancreatic Cancer
 
Pancreatic cancer is associated with the poorest prognosis of gastrointestinal cancers and is expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the USA by 2030. Pancreatic cancer is traditionally considered to be an immune-resistant disease. There is a lack of effector T cells, an abundance of myeloid-derived suppressor T cells, and a dearth of key immune effector and regulatory cells. This may be part of the reason why single-agent checkpoint inhibitors are not as effective in comparison to other diseases. Here is where breaking immune tolerance by inhibiting TGF-β with OT-101 will have a significant impact.
 
The P001 trial was an open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OT-101 (TGF-β2-specific Phosphorothioate Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotide) in adult patients with advanced tumors known to overproduce TGF- β2, which are not or no longer amenable to established therapies. The primary objective of the study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of two cycles of trabedersen administered intravenously (i.v.) on a 7-days-on/7-days-off or 4-days-on/10-days-off schedule. Secondary objectives included were: (1) determining the safety and tolerability of OT-101 administered intravenously at weekly intervals for four days every other week; (2) assessing the plasma pharmacokinetic profile of OT-101 administered intravenously at weekly intervals and for four days every other week; (3) establishing a suitable determination method and to assess the urine pharmacokinetic profile of OT-101 administered intravenously for four days every other week; (4) determining the effect of OT-101 administered intravenously at weekly intervals and for four days every other week on TGF-β2 plasma concentration levels; and (5) Assessing the potential antitumor activity of OT-101 administered intravenously at weekly intervals and for four days every other week, as assessed by the effect on tumor size and tumor markers.
 
Of the 61 patients treated, 37 had advanced treatment failure pancreas cancer, a very difficult-to-treat cancer with an overall survival rate that is measured in months even with the best available chemotherapy regimens. Globally, over 400,000 people die of pancreatic cancer each year. MTD was not reached for the 4-days-on/10-days-off schedule, which became the schedule adopted for the phase 2 expansion phase of the trial. Disease control (complete response (CR)), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD)) was achieved in 19 of 35 evaluable pancreas cancer patients (54%). Among liver mets only patients, there are exceptional single-agent activity and survival. Patient 1006 was pushed to complete response (CR) and survived as far out as 77 mos. This patient failed multiple lines of therapies: (1) surgery: Whipple’s procedure, (2) 1st line: 5-FU/LV, Dose 425 mg/m2, (3) 2nd line: 5-FU/LV, Dose 2600 mg/m2/24hr, (4) 3rd line: Gemcitabine, Dose 1000 mg/m2/week, and (5) went on to OT-101with liver mets and complete response. Patient 1022 was pushed to stable disease (“SD”) with overall survival of 40 months. This patient had also failed multiple lines of therapies: (1) surgery: Whipple’s procedure, (2) 1st line: radiation therapy (50 Gy), (3) 2nd line: 5FU, and (4) went on to OT-101 with liver mets and SD.

OT-101 treatment more than doubled the ratio of patients being able to go onto subsequent chemotherapy versus not being able, and consistent with the expected immunization boost coming from Xenogenization with subsequent chemotherapies (taxanes and 5FU/Cisplatin) as discussed for SIP, those with subsequent chemotherapy exhibited increased mOS and more than doubled their 1-year survival. Patients treated with the non-SIP agent did not exhibit these properties.
 
Gliomas
 
Brain tumors in the United States are rare and only accounted for 2% of all adult cancers. However, the rate of brain tumors on the rise for the last 30 years. The more common and most malignant form of brain tumors – glioblastoma (“GBM”) has more than doubled from 2.4 to 5.0 per 100,000. In the face of this increase, treatment remained essentially unchanged during the last decade. And despite aggressive surgery followed by radiation and/or chemotherapy, GBM has the worst five–year survival rates among all human cancers, with an average survival from diagnosis of only about 1 year and less than 5% of the patient survived after 5 years. On top of it all, GBM will recur or regrow in most patients. Treatment of recurring a high-grade GBM that has recurred does not always improve survival compared with hospice care alone and deciding when to stop treating the cancer and entering into hospice care is frequently recommended when the patient is unlikely to live longer than six months.
 
GBM resilience and persistence is in stark contrast with the recent excitement in oncology where Immuno Oncology (“IO”) agents have shown promise to be curative by driving the immune cells to attack the tumors. Though extraordinarily effective against the growing number of tumors, IOs have been ineffective against GBM. GBM is generally considered immunologically “cold” with few immune effector cells needed for successful immunotherapy. The overexpression of transforming growth factor-beta 2 (“TGF-β2”) is associated with poor prognosis of tumors and plays a key role in malignant progression of various tumors including GBM by inducing proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression. Oncotelic Inc. is developing a novel TGF-β2 antisense agent OT-101 as immunotherapy against GBM.
 
G004 is a multinational, multicenter, open-label, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group study in adult patients with either recurrent or refractory AA (WHO grade III) or recurrent or refractory GBM (WHO grade IV). There were 3 treatment groups: (1) 10 µM Trabedersen, (2) 80 µM Trabedersen, and (3) standard chemotherapy (mostly temozolomide). Tumor control rate at 6 months was the primary endpoint. Response assessment included the tumor control rate and the overall response rate, which were assessed at 6, 12, and 14 months by central MRI reading. The tumor control rate was defined as the percentage of patients with either CR, PR, or SD and the overall response rate was defined as percentage of patients with either CR or PR. An independent blinded central MRI reading was performed to obtain a standardized response assessment for the efficacy analysis. Central reading was performed by 2 independent neuroradiologists with an additional adjudicator deciding in case of conflicting opinions.
 
All patients had previous tumor surgery, almost all patients had previous radiation therapy, and more than half of the patients had received previous chemotherapy. A total of 134 patients, 89 patients in the OT-101 test group and 45 patients in the standard chemotherapy control group were assessed. The findings of a randomized Phase II study further confirmed the feasibility of intratumoral application of OT-101 via convection enhanced delivery (CED) for up to 6 months and showed that it results in early disease control at 6 months at a rate comparable to that achieved with temozolomide. OT-101 was administered to 89 R/R high-grade glioma (HGG) (Anaplastic Astrocytoma/AA:27; Glioblastoma multiforme/GBM: 62) patients with an intratumoral catheter using a convection enhanced delivery (CED) system. 77 patients (Efficacy population; GBM: 51; AA: 26) received at least the intended minimum number of 4 OT-101 treatment cycles. Response determinations were based on central review of MRI scans according to McDonald criteria. Standard statistical methods were applied for the analysis of data. Nineteen patients had a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) following a slow but robust size reduction of their target lesions. In addition, 7 patients had stable disease (SD) lasting ≥6 months. For the combined group of 26 AA/GBM patients with favorable responses, the median PFS was >3 years and OS was >3.5 years (16, 17). Hence, OT-101 administered intratumorally exhibits clinically meaningful single-agent activity and induces durable CR/PR/SD in R/R HGG patients. These results provided the proof of concept that targeting TGFβ2 with intratumoral OT-101 therapy can result in a favorable survival outcome for R/R HGG patients (AA, WHO grade 3 and GBM, WHO Grade 4).

OT-101: Pediatric DIPG
 
DIPG, the second most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, has a dismal outcome with available standard treatment modalities. No significant therapeutic advances have been accomplished in the treatment of this poor prognosis brain tumor and the average overall survival has remained <1 year with a 2-year survival rate of <10%. In solid tumors, the expression level of the TGFβ has been identified as a significant contributor to disease progression and poor prognosis as well as resistance to standard therapy and metastasis. In particular, TGFβ has been implicated in treatment resistance to targeted therapeutics, chemotherapy as well as immune-oncology drugs. Importantly, TGFβ restrains anti-tumor immunity by restricting cytotoxic T-cell infiltration, recruiting regulatory T cells and inhibiting the maturation as well as function of natural killer (“NK”) cells. Amplified activity of the TGFβ-Smad signaling pathway enhances tumor growth, invasion, as well as angiogenesis and has been implicated in the malignant phenotype and poor prognosis of high-grade gliomas in adults. Therefore, TGF-β has emerged as an attractive target for the therapeutic intervention of high-grade gliomas.
 
We recently performed a meta-analysis of TGFβ2 gene expression in primary tumor specimens from 29 pediatric DIPG patients in the publicly available archived datasets. Our data provided unprecedented evidence that TGFβ2 is expressed at high levels in pediatric DIPG. Three TGFβ2 probesets exhibited 1.8-2.5-fold increased levels of expression in DIPG patients. Our meta-analysis provided new evidence that TGFβ2 gene and its interactome are expressed in pediatric DIPG at significantly higher levels than in normal tissues or low-grade gliomas. Hence, TGFβ2 is an attractive molecular target for immunotherapy of pediatric DIPG.
 
The US FDA has granted the Company a RPD for pediatric DIPG.
 
OT-101 for Treatments of Corona Viruses
 
When COVID-19 emerged in China, the Company and GMP contemplated a collaboration to develop drug candidates for COVID-19. Oncotelic Inc. and GMP entered into a research and services agreement (the “GMP Agreement”) in February 2020 memorializing their collaborative efforts to develop and test COVID-19 antisense therapeutics. In March 2020, Oncotelic reported the anti-viral activity of OT-101 – its lead drug candidate currently in phase 3 testing in pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma. In an in vitro antiviral testing performed by an independent laboratory, OT-101 showed that it was highly active against COVID-19. Further, in March 2020, the Company, Oncotelic Inc. and GMP entered into a supplement to the Agreement (the “Supplement”) to confirm the inclusion of OT-101 within the scope of the GMP Agreement, pending positive confirmatory testing against COVID-19. In consideration for the financial support provided by GMP for the research, pursuant to the terms of the GMP Agreement (as amended by the Supplement), GMP is entitled to obtain certain exclusive rights to the use of the Product in the field of the treatment of COVID-19 on a global basis, and an economic interest in the use of the Product in the field of the treatment of COVID-19 including 50/50 profit sharing. In March 2020, the Company reported the anti-viral activity of OT-101, in an in vitro antiviral testing performed by an independent laboratory, OT-101 has an 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 7.6 µg/mL and is not toxic at the highest dose of 1000 µg/mL giving a safety index (SI) value of >130, which is considered highly active and on par or superior to Remdesivir- a Gilead’s drug. Unlike Remdesivir- OT-101 targets not only the virus replication but also the virus induced pneumonia and fibrosis.

A Phase 2 C001 Covid Study: “A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo Controlled, Multi-Center Study of OT-101 in Hospitalized COVID-19 Subjects” was completed for OT-101 in South America, that can expand into a Phase 3 trial if the data supports the safety of the drug. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OT-101 in adult patients hospitalized with positive COVID-19 and pneumonia. By suppressing TGF-β, OT-101 suppresses COVID-19 replication directly and has the potential to also suppressed viral induced pneumonia and fibrosis. In October 2021, Data lock and Study Data and Analysis Data Models (SDTMs & ADaMS Databases) were generated for the trial. The trial compares OT-101 in combination with Standard of Care (“SOC”) versus Placebo plus SOC (N= 32 pts at 2:1 randomization ratio). SOC includes dexamethasone, the only drug known to improve outcomes in severe cases of COVID-19. The top line data was:
 

1) | Safety endpoints met. OT-101 as a TGF-β inhibitor was safe to administer to COVID-19 patients including severe/critical COVID-19 patients. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Efficacy signals were obtained. End of treatment (Day 7) mortality for the entire study population was 4.5% OT-101 versus 20% for placebo. 
3) | Incidence of >96% viral load knockdown on End of Treatment (Day 7) was 89% for OT-101 versus 67% for placebo. 
4) | Overall survival improved 3X for critical COVID-19 pts (4 days for placebo versus 14 days for OT-101, p < 0.0166). 

 
Artemisinin for Treatment of COVID-19
 
Artemisinin derived from Chinese herb Artemisia annua L. (Sweet wormwood) has been used medicinally to treat fevers for centuries in China. Like other potential COVID-19 therapeutic agents such as Hydrochloroquine and Remesidivir, the efficacy of Artemisinin remains to be tested in well controlled and sufficiently powered clinical trials.
 
We discovered that Artemisinin was highly potent at inhibiting the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to multiply while also having an excellent safety index. The Company’s’ test results during an in vitro study at Utah State University showed Artemisinin having an EC50 of 0.45 ug/ml, and a Safety Index of 140. Artemisinin has the potential to target multiple viral threats, including COVID-19, by suppressing both viral replication and clinical symptoms that arise from viral infection. Viral replication cannot occur without TGF-β. Artemisinin also has been reported to have antiviral activities against hepatitis B and C viruses, human herpes viruses, HIV-1, influenza virus A, and bovine viral diarrhea virus in the low micromolar range. TGF-β surge and cytokine storm cannot occur without TGF-β. Clinical consequences related to the TGF-β surge, including ARDS and cytokine storm, are suppressed by targeting TGF-β with Artemisinin.
 
The availability of Artemisinin as a pre-existing dietary supplement may allow it to be deployed in many countries, including developing countries where the healthcare system can easily be overwhelmed. Its safety was clearly superior to chloroquine and remesidivir. The Company’s ARTI-19 trial in India was conducted by Windlas, the Company’s business partner in India, as part of the Company’s effort at deploying ArtiShieldTM across India, and a variation of that in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. No adverse events were reported that required discontinuation of treatment. When ARTIVeda™ / PulmoHeal™ was added to the SOC, more patients recovered faster than SOC alone.31 of 39 (79.5%) of patients taking became asymptomatic after 5-day of therapy. In comparison, only 12 of 21 control patients (57.1%) treated with SOC alone became asymptomatic on day 5. For the sicklier patients (WHO scale 4), the median time to becoming asymptomatic was only 5 days for the ARTIVeda™ / PulmoHeal™ + SOC group, as compared to 14 days for the SOC alone group. These data sets provided clinical support that targeting the TGF-β pathway with ARTIVeda™ / PulmoHeal™ may contribute to a faster recovery of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 patients. The Company has published the results of the trial in certain renowned publications. The Company is intending to continue developing Artemisinin as pharmaceutic for tropical viral diseases. Windlas had applied for regulatory approval for it’s Artemisinin based product, ArtiShieldTM, but has not been able to obtain regulatory approval for use of ArtiShieldTM as a COVID-19 therapy and as such, no significant revenues have been reported by Windlas nor have we accrued any royalties on Artemisinin due from Windlas.
 
CA4P as an Immuno-Oncology Agent
 
Radiation therapy, recognized for its potent cytotoxic effect on cancer cells by inducing direct DNA damage, can sometimes elicit a systemic antitumoral response. Irradiation releases a plethora of neoantigens and pro-inflammatory cytokines, acting like an in-situ vaccine, resulting in tumor regression within the primary site, but may also occasionally result in regression of distant secondary lesions. This regression of distant cancer metastases when the primary tumor is irradiated is defined as the abscopal effect. Yet, an abscopal effect with radiotherapy alone occurs infrequently, signifying that the antitumor immunity caused by radiation is not sufficient enough to abolish the tumor and its metastases nor able to prevent the metastatic process or the immunosuppressing effect the cancer exhibits on the host’s systemic macroenvironment. Recently, several studies have confirmed the synergistic antitumoral immunity caused by the combination of radiation with immunotherapy, which has demonstrated a durable abscopal effect in patients with advanced malignancies. Postow, et al, Golden, et al, Hinicker, et al and others have all described early findings of a reproducible abscopal effect when combining irradiation with Ipilimumab and/or Nivolumab.

Similarly, CA4P causes rapid and widespread tumor cell necrosis. A number of laboratories have shown that the type of tumor cell death induced by ischemic necrosis not only controls the presence or absence of specific tumor antigens, but also can result in immunological responses ranging from immunosuppression to anti-tumor immunity. The terms “immunogenicity of cell death” or “immunogenic cell death” (ICD) is often used by scientists to describe the ability of dead/dying cells (especially of tumor cells) to mount antigen-specific and particularly CD8 + T-cell-mediated adaptive immune responses and not simply lead to innate inflammation. CD8 + T-cells play significant role in tumor protection and development of this type of immunity. A modernized concept has emerged which defines immunogenic cell death in general because of mutual or consequent processes including endoplasmic reticulum stress release of “find-me” signals (e.g., ATP), exposure of “eat-me” signals (e.g., calreticulin, phosphatidylserine) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs [HMGB1, F-actin]). These molecular changes might occur in the cells undergoing necrotic death. These and other signals appear to be relevant to the potential for CA4P to increase immunogenicity following induction of ischemic necrosis.
 
Preclinical studies in which CA4P was combined with an anti-CTLA4 antibody using an EMT-6 mammary tumor model showed that 7 out of 8 mice receiving a combination of CA4P and an anti-CTLA4 antibody experienced complete remission of their tumors, compared to only 1 of 8 in the CA4P monotherapy arm and 2 of 8 in the anti-CTLA4 antibody monotherapy.
 
Three of four follow-up preclinical studies confirmed that CA4P combined with immuno-oncology agents could delay tumor growth. Follow-up studies were conducted in a CT26-32 colon cancer model, a larger tumor EMT-6 mammary cancer model, and a C3H mammary cancer model. Studies in a CT-26-32 colon cancer animal model using CA4P combined with anti-CTLA4 antibodies demonstrated a 77% reduction in tumor size compared to immuno-oncology agents alone, and an 89% reduction in tumor size compared to control. This large tumor model also showed a survival benefit for the animals receiving combination therapy, with all animals in the combination therapy group surviving to the end of the study, compared to no animals surviving on the control and only half of the animals surviving that received immuno-oncology agents alone.
 
Additional analyses of changes induced within tumors following combination therapy have shown that CA4P increases the immunogenic effect of checkpoint inhibitors when used alone as monotherapy. Tumor-fighting white blood cell counts, T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells compared to immuno-oncology agents alone. Tumor necrosis with the combination of CA4P and immuno-oncology agents is nearly double the necrosis with only immuno-oncology agents (63.9% compared to 32.8%, control = 25.8%).
 
The overall data from all these studies provides evidence that CA4P may enhance the activity of immuno-oncology agents for the treatment of cancer, including anti-CTLA4 antibodies. Furthermore, CA4P has clinical activity in melanoma in early clinical testing and repeated demonstration of CA4P mediated necrotic tumor cell death across 17 completed clinical trials and >500 patients. During various phase 1 studies, we found that CA4P treatment resulted significant disease control among patients with solid tumors who progressed on standard therapies. CA4P treatment resulted in 2 Stable Disease (SD) of 5 melanoma patients treated. The combination of CA4P with carboplatin and paclitaxel was well tolerated in the majority of patients with adequate premedication and had antitumor activity in patients who were heavily pretreated. Patients with advanced cancer refractory to standard therapy were treated with CA4P as a 10-min infusion, 20 h before carboplatin, paclitaxel, or paclitaxel, followed by carboplatin. Responses were seen in 10 of 46 (22%) patients with ovarian, esophageal, small-cell lung cancer, and melanoma. One Partial Response (PR) was observed of 6 melanoma patients treated follow progressing during first-line trial therapy with dacarbazine and sorafenib. In melanoma animal model- B16-F10 murine melanoma experimental tumors- seventy-four hours after drug administration, a decrease in the number of tumor blood vessels was apparent and necrotic areas within tumors were visible. Building on the single agent activity of CA4P, we are expecting that combination of CA4P with Ipilimumab or other immune-oncology drug would result in improved tumor control for these patients above the 2 PR out of 17 patients treated with Ipilimumab alone which supported the approval of Ipilimumab in pediatric melanoma.

CA4P: Pediatric Melanoma
 
Until the recent approval of ipilimumab as the first immunotherapy agent approved for children, metastatic or nonresectable pediatric melanoma did not have any FDA-approved therapies available. As for adult melanoma patients, the mainstay of care is surgical excision. Studies also show that children treated for melanoma should be closely monitored as they are at increased risk of recurrence later in life. However, there are only very limited data on the efficacy of systemic therapy in children and adolescents with advanced melanoma and new effective therapies are urgently needed. There are only very limited data on the efficacy of systemic therapy in children and adolescents with advanced melanoma. Several phase I/II trials have been designed to evaluate therapies for pediatric cancer patients that included subsets of patients with advanced melanoma.
 
Ipilimumab was evaluated in a phase I clinical study in children with unresectable stage IIIC or IV melanoma and in a pediatric phase II trial (NCT01696045) that included children aged 12 years or older with previously treated or untreated, unresectable stage III or IV malignant melanoma. Of the 17 melanoma patients older than 12 years treated with ipilimumab across both studies, two experienced objective responses. Immune-related adverse events included pancreatitis, pneumonitis, endocrinopathies, colitis, and transaminitis, with dose-limiting toxicities observed at 5 mg/kg. No grade 2 or higher immune-related toxicities were identified at doses of 3 mg/kg or less. Based upon the results of these studies and evidence from studies in adult patients, in July 2017, the FDA approved ipilimumab for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in children aged 12 years and older.
 
It is expected that combination of CA4P with Ipilimumab or other immune-oncology drugs would result in improved tumor control for these patients above the 2 PR out of 17 patients treated with ipilimumab.
 
The FDA has granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for CA4P/ Fosbretabulin tromethamine for the treatment of stage IIB–IV melanoma due to genetic mutations that disproportionately affect pediatric patients as a drug. Preclinical studies in which CA4P was combined with an anti-CTLA4 antibody using an EMT-6 mammary tumor model showed that 7 out of 8 mice receiving a combination of CA4P and an anti-CTLA4 antibody experienced complete remission of their tumors, compared to only 1 of 8 in the CA4P monotherapy arm and 2 of 8 in the anti-CTLA4 antibody monotherapy. This application is based on observed CA4P activity in melanoma in early clinical testing. During various phase 1 studies, we found that CA4P treatment resulted significant disease control among patients with solid tumors who progressed on standard therapies. CA4P treatment resulted in 2 Stable Disease (SD) of 5 melanoma patients treated. One Partial Response (PR) was observed of 6 melanoma patients treated follow progressing during first-line trial therapy with dacarbazine and sorafenib. Building on the single agent activity of CA4P, we are expecting that combination of CA4P with Ipilimumab or other immune-oncology drug would result in improved tumor control for the target pediatric population above the 2 PR out of 17 patients treated with Ipilimumab alone which supported the approval of Ipilimumab in pediatric melanoma.
 
OXi4503 for Acute Myeloid Leukemia
 
OXi4503 (combretastatin A1-diphsphate; CA1P) is a novel investigational VDA that has been shown to have a significant in vitro cytotoxic as well as chemo-sensitizing activity against human AML cells. OXi4503 also exhibited in vivo anti-leukemic activity in xenografted mice with human AML.
 
OXi4503 employs a new, broader strategy against AML than currently exists for standard chemotherapy, as it provides a dual mechanism of action involving both anti-vascular effects and direct cytotoxicity to AML cells. Vascular and/or Bone marrow endothelial cells (“ECs”) appear to provide a protective effect for AML cells, keeping them dormant within the bone marrow. VDAs may target these ECs and reverse their chemo protective effect, providing a novel approach to the treatment of AML which may otherwise be resistant to other chemotherapeutic therapies. Preclinical data indicate that OXi4503 alone and in combination with traditional AML treatments such as cytarabine may provide significant benefit in eliminating AML cells. Results from two completed Phase I clinical trials demonstrated the clinical impact potential of OXi4503 against relapsed AML when it is alone or in combination with the standard chemotherapy drug cytarabine (“ARA-C”) can induce complete remissions in relapsed AML patients. Notably, OXi4503 showed single agent activity in a clinical Phase I trial and resulted in complete remission of a relapsed AML patient. Sustained complete remissions were also achieved in relapsed AML patients who were treated with OXi4503 in combination with ARA-C.
 
OXi4503 has received orphan designation for AML in both the United States (Designation No. 12-3824) and the European Union (Designation No. EU/3/15/1587 - EMA/OD/144/15). In 2017, the FDA has granted fast-track designation to OXi4503 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AML. Oxi4503 met the qualifying criteria for the Fast Track designation since AML is a serious and life-threatening condition, and a large unmet medical need exists for additional treatment strategies for this disease.

The Investigator-Sponsored trial (IST) UF OXi4503 AML MDS Ph 1 (UF4503), “A Phase 1 Clinical Trial of OXi4503 for Relapsed and Refractory AML and Myelodysplastic Syndromes (“MDS”) was designed to evaluate the safety profile and the maximum tolerated dose (“I”) as well as a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of OXi4503 in patients with recurrent/refractory (R/R) AML and MDS (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01085656) (14, 50). The clinical single agent activity of OXi4503 was also assessed within the confines of a Phase 1 clinical trial setting. A total of 18 patients enrolled in the study from February 2011 to January 2016. The patients were predominantly male (78%) and the median age was 62.5 years. Of the 15 patients with AML, 4 (27%) had primary refractory AML, 2 (13%) were in first relapse, and 9 (60%) had refractory AML beyond CR1.
 
Eight patients (44%) completed at least one cycle of CA1P and were evaluable for efficacy assessments. Of the eight patients evaluable, one achieved morphologic remission with incomplete blood count recovery (“CRi”) after 1 cycle but came off study in cycle 2 due to fungal pneumonia. Three patients had stable disease after at least one cycle of CA1P. Three patients experienced progressive disease after 1 cycle of CA1P and were withdrawn from the study.
 
The Phase 1 dose-escalation combination of the Company sponsored study OX1222 (NCT02576301) was a Phase 1b dose escalation study of OXi4503 as a single agent and in combination with Cytarabine with subsequent combination Phase 2 cohorts for subjects with relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML and MDS. 29 subjects were treated with OXi4503 in combination with Cytarabine.
 
Of these 29 patients, one was evaluable for safety analysis, but no EFS/OS data or response data were available for activity evaluations. Of the 28 patients evaluable for EFS/OS outcome analyses, 26 had AML and 2 had MDS. For the 26 AML patients, there were 4 CRs. The CR responses were associated with prolonged overall survival substantially better the median OS time: One patient who became eligible for allogeneic PBSCT remains alive, free-of-leukemia at 720+ days. The overall survival times were 434 days, 521 days, 535 days and 720 days, respectively. The median OS time for the 4 patients who achieved a CR/CRi was 528 (95% CI: 434 - NA) days which was significantly better than the median OS time of 113 (95% CI: 77 - 172) days for the remaining 22 AML patients who did not achieve a CR (Log Rank = 11.8, P-value = 0.0006).
 
Three of the 4 CR/CRis were achieved in 1st relapse patients while one patient with CRi had failed 5 previous regimens, including 7:3, HiDAC, and PBSCT. Patients who achieved a CR/CRi went on to receive other treatments after receiving 4-6 cycles of OXi4503. The median OS for all 26 AML patients who received therapy was 119 (95% CI: 87 - 232) days. Patients who had rapidly progressive disease or developed toxicity could not get as many OXi4503 doses as patients who responded to their treatment favorably. The median OS time for 18 patients receiving 1-3 doses Of OXi4503 was 82 (95% CI: 66 - 135) days and these patients exhibited a worse survival outcome compared to 9 patients receiving 4-6 doses which was recorded at 434 (95% CI: 191 - NA) days (Log Rank = 12.3, P-value = 0.0004).
 
OXi4503: Pediatric AML
 
Pediatric AML is most common during the first 2 years of life and during the teenage years. In the United States, about 730 people under age 20 are diagnosed with AML each year. The number of deaths was 0.6 per 100,000 children per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2012-2016 cases.
 
Compared with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”), the outlook for pediatric AML patients is far worse. Even though pediatric AML cases are far fewer than pediatric ALL, the mortality rate is about the same, illustrating that AML is a devastating disease and the need for continuing research to identify effective treatments for these children. The prognosis for AML in children remains relatively poor, with a 5-year survival rate of 64% compared with 90% in ALL.
 
Patients with poor-risk cytogenetics include those that lack any favorable changes and harbor any of the following cytogenetic abnormalities: monosomy 7, monosomy 5, deletion of 5q, abnormalities of 3q, t(6;9)(p23;q34), and complex karyotype which is defined as three or more cytogenetic abnormalities. Children and adolescents harboring these unfavorable features have survival of less than 50 percent, and in many cases less than 20 percent.

The standard of care for management of pediatric AML involves predominantly induction therapy intended to put the patient into remission and consolidation chemotherapy designed to eradicate leukemia cells that may have escaped front line induction therapy. Whereas, >80% of pediatric AML patients will achieve remission, only about half will remain disease-free for an appreciable period of time. Approximately 30 percent of children with AML will experience relapse and only one third of them become long-term survivors after salvage therapy. Although cure rates for children and adolescents with AML have improved, outcomes for pediatric AML patients with adverse prognostic biologic features (e.g. high risk genetic mutations or chromosomal abnormalities) and refractory or relapsed disease who failed or did not respond to their initial standard induction chemotherapy remains poor and limited treatment options are available for these patients. Novel therapies for these high-risk patients are urgently needed. OXi4503 shows clinical potential and promise for this indication based on the proof-of-concept data obtained from nonclinical and clinical studies.
 
The FDA has granted a RPD for OXi4503 for the treatment of pediatric AML.
 
AI/Blockchain: PointR/EdgePoint
 
PointR, an acquisition made in November of 2019, develops, and deploys high performance cluster computers and artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies for inference processing of a camera-grid that are interconnected to create 360-degree vision-grid to track men and materials indoors. The scope has expanded to include the entire life cycle of a drug: discovery, clinical trials, and manufacturing. These grids provide real-time, localized decision-making harvesting complex data from structured and unstructured sources. Originally intended to be used exclusively for operator tracking in manufacturing, the AI is broadened to automate surveillance and inspections in processing lines. In addition, AI is being targeted to provide support for clinical trials and pre-clinical research.
 
The deployment of this supercomputing grid enables data capture and insight extraction in real time in blocks which are chained into blockchain ledger records serving as immutable transactions for stakeholders such as regulatory agencies, caretakers, insurers, payers, and manufacturers. The vision grid can integrate and fuse data from any type of sensors or collection devices. For example, the platform is a network of activity detection cameras and proximity beacons functionalized with AI algorithms to monitor, evaluate, and archive real time visual data as a series of metadata entries in a Blockchain ledger.

In the pharmaceutical industry PointR’s AI combined with Blockchain will be used in the entire life cycle of a drug: discovery, clinical trials and manufacturing. Leveraging its deep partnership with IBM, the PointR team will combine its own AI Vision technology with industry standard Blockchain to transform drug manufacturing and real-world evidence monitoring for clinical trials. The combined system has the potential to automatically record individual key steps in cGMP manufacturing operations including the flow of people, raw materials and operations in trusted perpetual blockchain ledgers that are indisputable. This has the potential to create much more efficient GMP manufacturing operations while simultaneously improving reliability and data security.
 
Data integrity is a large and unsolved problem within drug development and manufacturing. Data from 5 1/2 years of FDA inspection records, from 2014 to 2020, for four major markets: China, India, Europe, and the United States, revealed endemic data integrity issues including data manipulation. These stipulate that all manufacturing data must be preserved — unaltered — and made available to regulators. For example- out of more than 12,000 FDA inspections of drug plants in the United States, about 7% uncovered violations of the FDA’s data integrity rules including data manipulation. In India, about 24% of the plants inspected committed some sort of data violation, while in China, that figure is 31%. The consequences of data manipulation would be the invalidation of clinical data based on the adulterated drug product, safety concerns and liabilities to the patients, and FDA sanction and legal action.

The local real time AI processing of the data through grid computing allows for flexibility in data processing and AI training. Federated learning through grid supercomputing is inherently faster and more effective than mainframe supercomputing. In general, AI methods excel at automatically recognizing complex patterns in imaging data and providing quantitative assessments of the underlying characteristics. PointR AI deep learning algorithms have the capability of detecting meaningful relationships in image-recognition tasks in radiology and pathology. The coupling of image algorithm with Vision allows us to integrate imaging data frequently encountered during patient care into coherent metadata for blockchain ledgers. This can transform the design and implementation of clinical trials and accelerate outcomes. Combined with Blockchain the technologies will create trusted irrefutable ledgers which track real world monitoring and evidence gathering.
 
The Company’s non-controlling interest subsidiary, EdgePoint, is working to bring a solution that addresses both issues using proven technology. We intend to solve this problem with AI “machine vision” based on our proprietary technology, which is integrated with IBM and re-sold by IBM and its partners. We address the data integrity problem in a stepwise fashion. We start with streamlining the warehouse supply chain component. Later we add modules that spread across the plant in a comprehensive manner. We may spin-off Edgepoint as a separate publicly traded entity.
 
We expect our warehouse modules will streamline many labor issues in a manner very similar to Amazon-Go stores that run without cashiers. Monitored by a camera grid, shoppers simply enter, grab items and leave. A shopper can grab a sandwich and soda and leave within few minutes without checkout lines and delays. Amazon’s AI machine vision automation identifies the shoppers, the items they picked-up, consummates the transaction and sends receipt. Sounds like science fiction but there are 11 such stores nationwide and disrupting the retail industry.
 
Clinical AI Deployment: Oncotelic is anticipating a series of investigator led studies for its flagship product, OT-101. Investigator led studies are conducted by physicians in academic institutional settings. The university settings of clinical studies provide several benefits including their neutrality (appreciated by regulators), high quality (enhanced research corpus) and reduced expense (in-house resources). However, in data-collection, cleansing and analysis the investigator studies can be resource starved so resort to unconventional techniques such as spreadsheets on laptops which can affect the study. To offset the deficiency Oncotelic will deploy AI to streamline its clinical trials. By creating a data lake based on and in partnership with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) data will flow directly from patient’s hospital electronic medical records (EMR) into the clinical trial data-store called EDC. AI processes will extract relevant information from the records and populate the clinical database without any human intervention ensuring accuracy of the study-data transfer. Later the data can be analyzed by a number of machine learning tools that are attached to AWS frameworks for submission to regulators. The entire data workflow and storage will be under AWS regulation compliance practices satisfactory to any regulator.
 
Leveraging its partnerships with industry leaders, the AI team will combine its own AI technology with industry standard Blockchain to transform drug manufacturing. The combined system has the potential to automatically record individual key steps in cGMP manufacturing operations including the flow of people, raw materials, and operations in trusted perpetual blockchain ledgers that are indisputable. This has the potential to create much more efficient GMP manufacturing operations while simultaneously improving reliability and data security.
 
The company is designing a nanoparticle manufacturing plant to produce its own as well as 3rd party products. The plant will be paperless incorporating integrated computer automation with a real-time dashboard that includes AI for predictive maintenance and control of its fill-finish lines. Also, AI-based machine vision will inspect final vials for quality control before labeling, packing and distribution. The cost-benefit for AI is clear when it replaces labor-intensive and error-prone manual process of vial-inspections to detect inconsistencies for example accidental particulates in the mix, level-of the fill and damaged stoppers. The AI promises to replace labor-intensive and error-prone manual processes.
 
The deployment of this supercomputing grid enables data capture and insight extraction in real time in blocks which are chained into blockchain ledger records serving as immutable transactions for stakeholders such as regulatory agencies, caretakers, insurers, payers, and manufacturers.

Taking Retail AI to Drug Manufacturing
 
Using it’s Amazon-Go-like cashier-less AI proprietary technology, EdgePoint intends to address the human element in the drug manufacturing industry. Its TrustPoint product is designed to track men and materials with a camera grid and commit each transaction to a series of immutable blockchain records that are irrefutable permanent record of men and materials. The addition of blockchain technology, specifically our partner IBM’s version called Hyper-Ledger, enables manufacturers to conduct audits in a reliable and streamlined manner in a trustworthy system.
 
This automation of manual verification eliminates wasted and indeterministic human cycles. The product is a novel and potentially disruptive application of AI neural networks and blockchain to ensure compliance with drug sponsors and the FDA while ensuring a return on investment (“ROI”) for manufacturers by slashing labor costs.
 
The EdgePoint technology is already proven in the retail sector and generating revenues at a US east-coast, convenience store chain in partnership with IBM and its business partner Meridian IT. Meridian is a $0.5 billion systems conglomerate that ranked top-25 of managed services providers with 775 employees worldwide. The ceiling of the Amazon-Go retail store is a few hundred camera grid that track and shoppers with precision and monitor products they collect from shelves. When the shopper leaves the store, the AI automatically recognizes the shopper and items retrieved to issue a receipt. No human cashier is involved.
 
TrustPoint is a re-deployment of this type of tested technology for GMP drug manufacturing relieving human errors in supply chain and increasing compliance with warehouse operating procedures. For example, the warehouse module of TrustPoint will automatically create a shopping list from standard templates and alert supply chain personnel to collect and deliver a list of raw materials to manufacturing.

TrustPoint will track personnel authorized to collect materials of the shelves in compliance with picklist and generate alerts if the wrong materials are picked. It will commit the data to an immutable block chain ledger for later retrieval in case of compliance issues. Blockchain records are irrefutable and can be reproduced to trace with fidelity operating activities, e.g. authorized personnel, what they picked, who they delivered to with date and timestamps of each action.
 
In manufacturing plants, the implementation is even simpler Amazon-Go. The shoppers (supply chain personnel) are limited in number, not random and the raw materials are stable, and their shopping-list is automated by the machines that track the “shopping”. In this simplified version of Amazon-Go TrustPoint tracks supply chain personnel and monitors list of items collected from shelves. The automation is designed to reduce the overall human error element and increase compliance with standard operating procedures of the manufacturer, its customers and governmental oversight agencies.
 
Market
 
Human labor costs represent the most expensive element in drug manufacturing. In the $70.0 billion CDMO (contract development manufacturing operations) industry, personnel costs of $30 billion are ripe for computer automation. Until now, computer technologies like MRP and ERP created more problems than resolved. The labor problem is compounded by the cost of personnel onboarding and turnover. It takes 6-9 months to train a quality control employee only to lose them to a competitor.
 
The market is large. Approximately 10,000 drug manufacturing facilities worldwide are FDA and EMA (European FDA) registered, representing a significant addressable market for EdgePoint. Many such facilities run on paper-based, handwritten forms ripe for modernization by the TrustPoint product. The $70.0 billion CDMO industry is poised to grow to $123.0 billion by 2025 according to industry experts. EdgePoint has first mover advantage and expects to lead the industry’s transition. It expects to garner significant share of the labor automation market. Addressing the $30.0 billion labor market and more specifically the $12.0 billion supply-chain segment, EdgePoint expects to improve efficiencies and create additional value for shareholders. EdgePoint intends to address the $12.0 billion market with AI Vision, BlockChain and NLP.
 
Go-to-Market: IBM
 
The Company’s go-to-market plan is to execute a proof-of-concept project with a biologic substance manufacturer called iBIO Inc. based in Texas. The expected outcome is a re-sellable product for materials release deployed by iBIO with production level data to attract a rich pipeline of paying customers. The company has partnered with IBM in multiple areas including sales and distribution. The significant value to IBM in this partnership is the enrichment EdgePoint provides to the IBM product suites vertically targeting cGMP manufacturing. There are three areas of technology enrichment and technology collaboration.
 

1. | AI Vision: IBM has developed data center hardware and software for machine vision training. While EdgePoint complements IBM products with its in-plant, on-premises low profile cluster computers called BRICKs and cameras. The integration between EdgePoint and IBM machine vision products (IBM Power AI Vision software running on state-of-the-art IBM AC922 GPU cluster computer) and EdgePoint enables continuous updates to the AI models.

Our Strategy and Development Plan
 
We have been operating with significant capital constraints since the reverse merger between the Company and Oncotelic Inc, and for this time period we have been seeking to secure sufficient funding to continue our operations while we simultaneously seek to advance our all our investigational drugs for the treatment of cancer, coronaviruses, AI technology and more recently for PD, ED and FSD. Subject to our ability to secure additional capital, we would seek to further develop our product candidates. However, our inability to access capital historically has and may significantly impairs our ability to develop these compounds. If we are able to advance any or all of our drug candidates, we would seek to develop them till commercialization, however, there is no guarantee that we would be able to fully develop our products, obtain regulatory approvals and successfully commercialize them.
 
We continue to discuss collaboration opportunities with other biopharmaceutical companies, although to date have not secured any agreements with companies that are willing to purchase the products from us or license the development and commercialization rights. We intend to continue to seek a partner to acquire the marketing rights to our product candidates and to finance further clinical studies and will seek to complete a transaction if we are able to reach mutual agreement on terms. We were in discussions with GMP to further the development of OT-101, primarily for oncology indications and COVID-19, as well as CA4P and Oxi4503. The Company entered into a JV with Dragon Overseas Capital Limited (“Dragon Overseas”) and GMP Biotechnology Limited (“GMP Bio”), affiliates of GMP on March 31, 2022. GMP Bio and the Company will work together to further the development of OT-101, wherein the Company would provide the technology and technical expertise and GMP Bio would fund the development expenses.
 
In addition to entering into a transaction that would provide funding for the further development of our product candidates, other elements of our development strategy would currently include:
 

● | Initiating clinical trials of OT-101 in various cancers: We have yet to initiate any trials but we are evaluating conducting such trials in the US as well as other countries like China in conjunction with GMP Bio. We are looking to conduct such trials in combination with other drugs like checkpoint inhibitors. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Conducting follow up clinical trials of OT-101 for COVID-19: The Company planned and initiated a Phase 2 trial for OT-101 in Latin America and reported preliminary results in October 2021. Data lock and Study Data and Analysis Data Models were generated for the Phase 2 COVID-19 Study. The trial compared OT-101 plus SOC versus Placebo plus SOC in a total of 32 patients at a 2:1 randomization ratio. We are considering expanding the study into China and other countries. For China, we could conduct such trials in conjunction with our development partners GMP. 
● | We have completed a 120-patient trial for Artemisinin. We continue to further develop Artemisinin as pharmaceutic against respiratory viral infections. 
● | Initiating a clinical trial of CA4P in combination with an immuno-oncology agent: Based on preclinical data generated to date and support of two well-known immuno-oncology clinical investigators, we have developed a protocol for a clinical trial that would be the first human clinical trial combining CA4P and an approved immuno-oncology agent. This trial is designed to make initial determinations of whether the combination results in improved patient outcomes, including safety, overall survival, progression free survival, objective response rate, tumor size and other parameters. 
● | Continuing to evaluate OXi4503 in a clinical trial: We have completed six ascending dose cohorts of OXi4503 in combination with cytarabine in Study OX1222 in patients with relapsed/refractory AML and/or MDS. In the highest dose cohort, the sixth cohort of the study, we observed potential safety signals which triggered stopping rules for the study and resulted in a partial clinical hold from the FDA until we and the FDA assess additional safety data, particularly at the fifth dose cohort level. In the fifth dose cohort of OX1222, we have observed the best potential signs of efficacy to date in the trial and believe treatment of additional patients would provide additional evidence regarding the efficacy of OXi4503 in these indications 
● | Ramping up the apomorphine development program and initiating noninferiority trial comparing AL-101 against subcutaneous apomorphine for the treatment of PD. We are also considering to ramp up the apomorphine development programs for ED and FSD/HSDD.

REGULATORY MATTERS
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Government authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application (“NDA”), process before they may be legally marketed in the United States.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to review or approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusal of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) or other applicable regulations; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which must be first approved by the FDA before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
● | submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
● | satisfactory completion of FDA inspections of clinical sites and GLP toxicology studies; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

 
The testing and approval process require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Preclinical testing continues even after the IND is submitted. The IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.

All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
 
Each new clinical protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and efficacy in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2: Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminary efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
● | Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. 

 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. IND Safety Reports must be submitted to the FDA, IRBs and the investigators for (a) any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected; (b) any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple trials, or clinical trials (other than those already reported in (a)); (c) any findings from animal or in vitro testing, whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, such as reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure; and (d) any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, which may include orphan drug status and the first NDA application for a company.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA also may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA at its discretion or the FDA may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such additional data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or others may interpret the same data. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to obtain approval of the NDA. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will generally inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will also generally inspect selected clinical sites that participated in the clinical studies and may inspect the testing facilities that performed the GLP toxicology studies cited in the NDA.
 
NDAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the approval process.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases or patient subpopulations and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, approval by the FDA may include a requirement for phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness, and the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances.

In the European Union and Japan, orphan drug exclusivity regulations provide for 10 years of market exclusivity.
 
CA4P has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of anaplastic, medullary, Stage IV papillary and Stage IV follicular thyroid cancers, ovarian cancer, neuroendocrine tumors and glioma. OXi4503 has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia. CA4P has been awarded orphan drug status by the FDA for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and glioblastoma.
 
CA4P has also been awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer and neuroendocrine tumors. OXi4503 has been awarded orphan drug status by the European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia. OT-101 has been awarded orphan drug status by European Commission in the European Union for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and glioblastoma.
 
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation
 
The FDA grants rare pediatric disease designation for diseases with serious or life-threatening manifestations that primarily affect people aged from birth to 18 years, and that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Under the FDA’s Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, a sponsor who receives an approval of a new drug application or biologics license application for a product for the prevention or treatment of a rare pediatric disease may be eligible for a voucher, which can be redeemed to obtain priority review for any subsequent marketing application and may be sold or transferred. Such vouchers can be valued at several millions of dollars, sometimes in excess of $100 million.
 
The FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for OT-101/Trabedersen for the treatment of DIPG as a drug for a rare pediatric disease.
 
The FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for CA4P/ Fosbretabulin tromethamine for the treatment of stage IIB–IV melanoma due to genetic mutations that disproportionately affect pediatric patients as a drug.
 
The FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for Oxi4503 for the treatment of AML as a drug for a rare pediatric disease.
 
Expedited Review and Approval
 
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may subsequently decide the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the FDA may not shorten the review or approval time period. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast-Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Drugs that receive an accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials.
 
OXi4503 has been awarded Fast Track designation for the treatment of AML.

Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and if any of our product candidates are approved, we will be subject to additional regulations regarding commercial sales and distribution. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval to test a product candidate in the United States, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence testing any product candidate in those countries. Likewise, whether or not we obtain FDA approval to market a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence marketing of any product candidate in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and optional for those medicines which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 
As in the United States, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, may grant orphan drug status for specific indications if the request is made before an MAA is submitted. The EMA considers an orphan medicinal product to be one that affects less than five of every 10,000 people in the European Union. A company whose application for orphan drug designation in the European Union is approved is eligible to receive, among other benefits, regulatory assistance in preparing the marketing application, protocol assistance and reduced application fees. Orphan drugs in the European Union receive up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication.
 
Reimbursement
 
Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for health care products and services. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption or application of price controls and cost-containment measures could limit our revenue. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective, they may not pay for our products even if we receive approval, or their level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposes requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D (the Medicare prescription drug benefit), Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs not covered under Medicare Part B. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs. Each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. Federal regulations require Part D prescription drug formularies to include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, although not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class.
 
In general, government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA or other Medicare regulations may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act” or “ACA”) mandated prescription drug coverage as one of ten essential health benefits that most health plans must offer, requiring coverage of at least one drug in every category and class. The ACA increased in the number of individuals covered by insurance and as a result commercial insurers and government programs have increased their emphasis on cost controls to reduce overall spending. A number of federal government leaders have expressed their intentions to repeal and replace the ACA. If full or partial repeal is enacted, many if not all of the provisions of the ACA may no longer apply to prescription drugs. As a result, we expect that there will continue to be uncertainty regarding drug product pricing, reimbursement and other factors impacting the revenue we may receive if our product candidates are ultimately approved, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and tend to be significantly lower.
 
PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
 
We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including chemical species, compositions and forms, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, as well as modified forms of naturally-expressed receptors, in the United States and other jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets. We also rely upon trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information.
 
As of May 12, 2020, we were the exclusive licensee, sole assignee or co-assignee of fifteen granted U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, and granted patents and/or pending applications in several other major markets, including the European Union, Canada and Japan. Our policy is to file U.S. and foreign patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. There can be no assurance that any of these patent applications will result in the grant of a patent either in the United States or elsewhere, or that any patents granted will be valid and enforceable, or will provide a competitive advantage or will afford protection against competitors with similar technologies. We also intend to rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel drugs. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements.
 
We consider the following U.S. patents and applications owned by or exclusively licensed to us to be particularly important to the protection of our most advanced product candidates.
 

Product Candidate | Patent Scope | Patent Expiration 
----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------
CA4P | Use of VDAs to Enhance Immunomodulating Therapies Against Tumors | August 2036 
OXi4503 | Method for Treating Myeloid Neoplasm by Administering OXi4503 | November 2028 
OT-101 | Combination of A Chemotherapeutic Agent and An Inhibitor of the TGF-β System | July 2030 to 
 | Combination Therapy for Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer | February 2036 
 | Compositions and Methods for Treating Cancer | February 2036

In addition to these patents, for some of our product candidates, we have patents and/or applications that cover a particular form or composition, use for a particular indication, use as part of combination therapy or method of preparation or use, as well as other pending patent applications. These issued patents, including any patents that issue from pending applications, could provide additional or a longer period of protection. We also have patent applications pending that seek equivalent or substantially comparable protection for our product candidates in jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets.
 
The patent expiration dates referenced above do not reflect any potential patent term extension that we may receive under the federal Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act generally permits a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug application, or IND, and the submission date of a new drug application, or NDA, plus the time between the submission date and approval date of an NDA. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for patent term extension.
 
As previously noted, the FDA and European Union have granted CA4P and OXi4503 orphan drug status for certain indications. We are also pursuing, and may continue to in the future to pursue, orphan drug status for other product candidates and indications. Our ability to obtain and maintain the exclusivity for our products and product candidates by virtue of their orphan drug status is an important part of our intellectual property strategy. Also as previously noted, we emphasizing on Rare Pediatric Designation to leverage on the regulatory exclusivity and voucher program associated with these designations.
 
COMPETITION
 
The industry in which we are engaged is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include, among others, major pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, nearly all of which have financial, technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many of the small companies in our industry have also formed collaborative relationships with large, established companies to support research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and patenting new technologies in our line of business and any of these entities may commercialize products that may be competitive with ours.
 
We expect that, if any of our products gain regulatory approval for sale, they will compete primarily on the basis of product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, reliability, price and patent protection. Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop effective proprietary products and implement joint ventures or other alliances with large pharmaceutical companies in order to jointly market and manufacture our products.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
We had sixteen full-time employees as of December 31, 2021. We rely on external consultants or outsource nearly all our research, development, preclinical testing and clinical trial activity, although we maintain managerial and quality control over our clinical trials. We also rely on external consultants for various administrative tasks that are required for a public company. We expect to continue to rely on external service providers and to maintain a small number of executives and other employees. Our relations with our employees are good and we do not have any unions for the Company.

COSTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS
 
We have not incurred any costs associated with compliance with environmental regulations, nor do we anticipate any future costs associated with environmental compliance; however, no assurances can be given that we will not incur such costs in the future.
