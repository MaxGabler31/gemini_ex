Item 1 Business
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
In General 
 
Elray Resources, Inc. (“Elray” or “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada on December 13, 2006.
 
On February 23, 2011, Elray entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “Splitrock Agreement”) to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Splitrock Ventures (BVI) Limited (“Splitrock”), a British Virgin Islands company. Splitrock is in the online gaming business. On the closing date, pursuant to the terms of the Splitrock Agreement, Anthony Goodman, representing the shareholders of Splitrock, acquired shares of Elray’s common stock, which resulted in a change of control under which 70% of the shares of Elray were held by the previous shareholders of Splitrock. In accordance with the Splitrock Agreement, Barry J. Lucas resigned as Chairman and Director and Anthony Goodman was elected as a replacement; Neil Crang resigned as Director and Donald Radcliffe and Roy Sugarman were elected as replacements; and Michael J. Malbourne resigned as Secretary and David E Price, Esq. was appointed as a replacement.
 
On December 9, 2011, Elray entered into an Amended Purchase Agreement (“Amended Splitrock Agreement”) which amended certain elements of the Splitrock Agreement originally entered into by the parties on February 23, 2011. Whereas under the Splitrock Agreement, the Company was to acquire 100% of the shares of Splitrock, pursuant to the Amended Splitrock Agreement, the Company shall instead acquire only certain assets and liabilities of Splitrock. 
 
The existing officers and directors of Elray resigned and the directors nominated by Splitrock; Messrs. Radcliffe, Sugarman, and Goodman, were elected to the board of Elray. Mr. Goodman was appointed Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of Elray. On October 27, 2011, Donald Radcliffe resigned as director and Michael Silverman was appointed as his replacement.
 
As part of the Amended Splitrock Agreement, Elray acquired gaming intellectual property, gaming domains, trademarks and player databases (“Splitrock IP”). Elray’s strategy is to provide online gaming to players in markets where such activities are legal.

The Company has opened a virtual managed corporate office located in Las Vegas in order to meet potential requirements put forth by lawmakers in pending state and federal legislation. Under the proposed bills, Internet-enabled gaming operations must adhere to strict rules including locally-based operations and technology that allows for IP address restrictions and user age verification.
 
On April 10, 2013, the Company entered into a 12-month consultancy agreement with online casino operator, Universal Technology Investments Limited ("UTI"). The Company would assist in the marketing and support of UTI's online casino for a twelve-month term, with a provision to provide additional services as UTI expands their gaming portfolio. The consultancy service was not started until January 2014. This agreement not only brings operating revenue to the Company, but also solidifies the expertise in the online gaming market, and assists in positioning the Company with respect to being a premier turnkey service provider for both the online and mobile gaming sector. 
 
On July 14, 2013, the Company entered into a 12-month consultancy agreement with Virtual Technology Group, LLC ("VTG") to assist the Company in developing, marketing and supporting the technology of virtual online horse racing products and to provide the Company the exclusive use right to certain website domains. 
 
On January 23, 2014, the Company entered into a Know-How and Asset Purchase Agreement, with VTG and Gold Globe Investments Limited, a BVI company (“GGIL”). VTG and GGIL are engaged in the development of web technology and have jointly developed both an E-store and a virtual exchange platform that facilitate trading of virtual items and casino credits as well as bitcoins. The Company acquired these assets to assist the Company to continue to build and support its marketing and support business for online casinos and social games. 
 
On August 24, 2016, the Company entered into a Strategic Partnership Agreement with Articulate Pty Ltd (“Articulate”), a company controlled by Mr. Brian Goodman, the Company’s CEO. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company agreed to provide online intellectual property includes CRM systems, payment gateway system and back office marketing systems. Articulate agreed to provide online gaming support and marketing services to Elray. Both parties started to work together to provide service to commerce and gaming companies. The agreement was made effective on August 1, 2016.
 
About our Online Gaming Technology
 
Elray has developed and acquired unique valuable technology that provides state of the art turnkey, marketing tools and CRM systems for online gaming operators. 
 
Elray is an established technology company, which owns and licenses gaming intellectual property, gaming content, gaming domains and trademarks.
 
Elray is a United States (“U.S.”) company and has a global presence in London, South Africa and Sydney, homes of the largest gaming operators, which helps Elray actively manage and serve its clients. Elray’s sophisticated software automatically declines any gaming requests from within the United States, in strict compliance with current U.S. law.

Elray’s sophisticated software systems automatically decline and denies any gaming requests from within illegal gaming jurisdictions including but not limited to the United States, Hong Kong, Singapore, United Kingdom, France, Italy and Israel and prevents any access to the products that we support from any of these jurisdictions ensuring that residents of these countries cannot participate and are in strict compliance with the laws of these countries.
 
Intellectual Property and Patents
 
We own various domain names and customer databases intended for use in online gaming, including the Splitrock IP as defined previously. 
 
Compliance with Government Regulations
 
Our sophisticated software systems automatically declines and denies any gaming requests from within illegal gaming jurisdictions including but not limited to the United States, Hong Kong, Singapore, United Kingdom, France, Italy and Israel and prevents any access to the products that we support from any of these jurisdictions ensuring that residents of these countries cannot participate and are in strict compliance with the laws of these countries. Our Sydney office allows us to tap into skilled resources and some of the world's largest client base, for regular, personal interaction. 
 
We are required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to online gaming. Regulations relating to online gaming vary significantly in different jurisdictions. Various sophisticated methods are utilized prior to acceptance of deposits to ensure that funds are only accepted from gamers in jurisdictions in which we are legally entitled to provide services.
 
The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (“UIGEA”) became United States law in late 2006 and effectively curtailed legal participation by U.S. players in online gambling. The UIGEA prevented financial transactions related to online gaming in the U.S. Players in the U.S. are currently legally precluded from participating in online gambling. Elray’s online gaming products are not available to U.S. players and also not available to residents of Hong Kong. 
 
Our active operations that we support are in jurisdictions that are friendly to online gaming. Elray fully complies with the United States Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006.
 
Numerous efforts are underway to allow regulated online gaming in the U.S. and there is pressure to allow gaming to derive tax revenue and comply with various free trade agreements. A report by PricewaterhouseCoopers asserts, “We estimate the legislation (to legalize online U.S. gambling) could increase federal revenues by as much as $51.9 billion over the 2009 to 2018 period in the event that no sports leagues or states opted out of the regulatory regime.” The potential reopening of the United States for online gaming clearly presents a huge potential upside.” If this occurs, Elray will be well positioned to make its online gaming immediately available to U.S. online players.
 
Competition
 
Our primary competition is expected from overseas based online gaming technology companies. With few exceptions, significant listed gaming companies (many of which are listed on the London Stock Exchange) operate using their own software. As an independent online gaming technology provider, we believe that we retain the ability to utilize the most profitable platform available and are not restricted to a single platform. Additionally, by ensuring that we operate in compliance with U.S. laws, we believe that in the event of legalized gaming in the U.S., we would not be precluded from taking advantage of U.S.-based gaming.
