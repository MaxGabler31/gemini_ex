Corporate History and General Information
 
Veroni Brands Corp. (“Veroni” or the “Company”) was incorporated as “Echo Sound Acquisition Corporation” on December 7, 2016 under the laws of the State of Delaware. In September 2017, the Company implemented a change of control by issuing shares to new stockholders, redeeming shares of existing stockholders, electing a new officer and director and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors.
 
In connection with the change in control, the stockholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company’s name from Echo Sound Acquisition Corporation to European CPG Acquisition Corporation. In November 2017, the stockholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company’s name to Veroni Brands Corp.
 
The Company is located at 2275 Half Day Road, Suite 346, Bannockburn, Illinois 60015. The Company’s main phone number is 888-794-2999. The Company’s fiscal year end is December 31. Neither the Company nor its predecessors have filed for bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceedings nor are in the process of filing for bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceedings.
 
Relationship with Tiber Creek Corporation
 
Igor Gabal on behalf of GP Michigan, LLC, the Company’s sole officer and director, previously entered into an agreement with Tiber Creek, whereby Tiber Creek would provide assistance to GP Michigan, LLC in effecting transactions for Mr. Gabal and GP Michigan, LLC to acquire a public reporting company, including: transferring control of a public reporting company to Mr. Gabal and/or GP Michigan; causing the preparation and filing of forms, including a registration statement, with the Securities and Exchange Commission; assist in listing its securities on a trading exchange; and assist in establishing and maintaining relationships with market makers and broker-dealers. GP Michigan agreed to pay Tiber Creek $80,000 for those services, which was recorded as a capital contribution on behalf of the Company, and of which $48,000 was recorded to prepaid expenses and $32,000 to professional fees on behalf of the Company as of December 31, 2017.
 
Under the agreement, Tiber Creek has received to date $55,000 from Igor Gabal of the $80,000 fee. As of December 31, 2018, $25,000 is still owed to Tiber Creek. In addition, the Company’s then-current stockholders, James Cassidy and James McKillop, were permitted to retain an aggregate total of 250,000 shares of the original 20,000,000 shares owned prior to the change in control.
 
Background
 
The Company is currently a development-stage company, and it has a limited operating history and is expected to experience losses in the near term. The Company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Summary
 
The business of the Company in 2018 focused on the import, sales and distribution of premium beverage products, primarily produced in Europe. Within this strategy, Veroni secured a long-term exclusive import and distribution agreement with a major European supplier, FoodCare Sp. z o,o., a company organized under the laws of the Poland (“FoodCare”). Veroni is the sole and exclusive importer and distributor of Iron Energy in the U.S., an energy drink sponsored by celebrity boxer Mike Tyson, with access to numerous other beverage brands through this partnership. In summer 2018, the Company introduced the Iron Energy beverage to various retailers and distributors nationwide and since then has been working with many retailers and distributors to bring the product to market.

In January 2019, the Company expanded its product offerings and established a relationship with another manufacturer, ZWC Millano, to import chocolate products, as well as snacks, for distribution to major retailers throughout the United States. The Company recently became the vendor of record and successfully delivered these products to Family Dollar, Dollar General and will be delivering in summer 2019 to Costco and few other retailers.
 
In February 2019, the Company engaged Tyler Distribution and Continental Logistics, two operating companies of Port Jersey Logistics, to better serve its customers throughout the United States. Management believes that this partnership will give the Company a tremendous opportunity to support its growth, as it will be able to store and ship products and fulfill its purchase orders received from its customers.
 
Risks and Uncertainties Facing the Company
 
The Company has received limited revenues from a few customers to date; however, it is Veroni’s goal to begin increase sales of its licensed products by securing relationships with more distributors, food and beverage retailers and by expanding its portfolio of products through strategic partnerships with new suppliers.
 
As an early-stage company, the Company has a limited operating history and is expected to continuously experience losses in the near term. The Company needs to generate increased revenues and/or obtain additional financing in order to continue its business plans. As a company in the early part of its life, management of the Company must continue to build relationships with food and beverage retailers and effectively market its products in order to execute the business plan of the Company on a broad scale. Further, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to identify sufficient numbers of customers to generate enough revenues to continue operations or proceed with developing its business in accordance with its business plan.
 
One of the biggest challenges facing the Company will be in securing adequate capital to fund its projects, including securing adequate capital to pay for the products from the manufacturers. Secondarily, following the procurement of product from the manufacturers, a major challenge will be implementing effective sales, marketing and distribution strategies to reach the intended end customers. The Company has considered and devised its initial sales, marketing and advertising strategy; however, the Company will need to skillfully implement this strategy in order to achieve success in its business.
 
Due to these and other factors, the Company’s need for additional capital, the Company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
The Business: Food and Beverage Distribution
 
Veroni is an importer, seller and distributor of premium food and beverage products, primarily from Europe. Within this strategy, Veroni has secured a long-term exclusive import and distribution agreement with a major European supplier, FoodCare Sp. z o,o., a company organized under the laws of the Poland (“FoodCare”). Veroni is the sole and exclusive importer and distributor to the United States market of Iron Energy, an energy drink sponsored by celebrity boxer Mike Tyson, with access to numerous other beverage brands through this long-term partnership. In addition, the Company has established a relationship with another manufacturer, ZWC Millano, to import snacks and chocolate products for distribution to major retailers throughout the United States.
 
We believe that Veroni’s business will have the following strategic advantages:
 

● | U.S.-Based Distribution for European Products: Through the development of relationships with European suppliers, we believe that our business will enable foreign suppliers to penetrate the U.S. market through immediate access to Veroni’s future network of sales, broker, distributors and retailers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | International Beverage Portfolio – Veroni’s product offerings will consist of an established European quality beverage portfolio of energy drinks, water, juices and Ice tea. 
● | Diverse Products - Veroni’s product offerings will be available in a variety of flavors, sizes and price points.

The Company’s goal is to become a one-stop shop to the food and beverage distributors. Veroni will endeavor to have its distributors achieve and maintain Veroni’s Retail Vision: (1) Off-premise guidelines will include distribution, display and space management, holding power, brand positioning, price signage, retail merchandising and quality assurance; and (2) On-premise guidelines will include distribution, feature support and retail merchandising and promotional/sampling events.
 
We have confidence in our strategy to utilize the food and beverage distributors nationwide and route to the retail market and consumers.

Iron Energy Drink Product sponsored by Mike Tyson

Iron Energy’s target consumers are college students, young transitional adults coming out of college, independent singles in their 20’s and 30’s, athletes and the “party-goers” population.
 
The Company’s Iron Energy drink product line is available in three flavors, in 8.4oz and 11.2oz quantities:

Iron Energy Branded Products
 

The Company’s sales imperatives are to grow Iron Energy’s profitable volume, increase Iron Energy brand distribution, and create Iron Energy network excitement and enthusiasm for the Iron Energy portfolio. The Company will align Iron Energy Frontline and Promoted Price to Consumer (PTC) at the premium level; similar to Red Bull. The Company’s price promotional schedule strategy will be designed to promote during key high-volume periods, and create excitement, trial and increased sales.

Other Products
 
In addition to the Iron Energy drink, the Company is the exclusive U.S. importer and distributor for the following products:
 

● | N-Gine, an energy drink; 
--+-------------------------------------------
● | Fitella’s line of whole grain cereals; 
● | Frugo fruit drinks; and 
● | 4Move isotonic and vitamin drinks. 

The Market
 
Since the Red Bull brand arrived in the U.S. in 1997, management believes that the energy drink category has been characterized by fast growth and high margins. As the segment centered on a handful of major brands, most of them moving to retail through captive distribution systems, for a while there was a large flow of new entrants, some of them very well financed, but that has slowed as the difficulty of making much headway has become clear. Thus, many smaller brands either seek to carve out an identity as healthier than mainstream brands, with their artificial ingredients and curious and misunderstood fortifiers like taurine, or have sought to occupy carefully targeted marketing niches.
 
According to Packaged Facts report, Energy & Sports Drinks: U.S. Market Trends & Opportunities, sales of energy and sports drinks grew to $25 billion in sales in 2016 after rising at an annual rate of 7% over the preceding half decade. Packaged Facts forecasts that energy and sports drinks will remain among the fastest growing sectors of the beverage market.1
 
Research by the United Kingdom-based firm IndexBox indicates that the U.S. chocolate market is expected to exceed $20 billion by 2025. An article published in March 2018 states that: “Chocolate and confectionery consumption in the United States is expected to continue its upward trend, supported by population growth and rising purchasing power, along with increasing demand for premium chocolate and confectionery items.”2 The article stated that “IndexBox also noted approximately 15 percent of chocolate and confectionery items consumed in 2016 were imports, up 8 percent from 2008.” Accordingly, management believes that the Company may be well-positioned by distributing premium chocolate products imported from Poland.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
Through its agreement with Food Care, which has engaged celebrity and former boxer Mike Tyson to act as “brand ambassador” for the Iron Energy drink, the Company may in the future use Mike Tyson at:

● | Special events appearances 
--+-------------------------------------------------
● | Trade shows participation 
● | Distributors and retailers “meet and greets” 
● | Veroni Brands Sponsorship events 
● | Social media 

 
Further, the Company plans to market the Company’s products via the following retail merchandising and promotional programs:
 

● | Ad features and promotional activities 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Shelf placement and adjacencies 
● | Feature and multiple display programming 
● | Loyalty card 
● | In-store sampling and promotions 
● | Merchandising via shelf strips, counter cards, paper and permanent P.O.S. such as mirrors and signs 
● | College rep program at major East Coast and Southern California universities

Strategic Partners, Retailers and Suppliers

The Company proposes to partner with Crossmark® to market and promote Iron Energy and hopes to work with several strategic partners in important areas of its business and operations to grow its distribution. Currently, the Company has an exclusive distribution agreement, covering the United States market, with a European food and beverage supplier, FoodCare Sp. z o,o., a company organized under the laws of the Poland (“FoodCare”), through which it has the exclusive right to distribute the Iron Energy drink, as well as an assortment of other products. It also has an arrangement with ZWC Millano to import various snacks and chocolate products.
