 ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
 Overview
 We operate in one reportable segment engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGL resources. Our assets are characterized by concentrated acreage positions in Southeast Texas with multiple producing stratigraphic horizons, or stacked pay zones, and attractive single-well rates of return. We primarily operate in Burleson, Lee and Washington Counties where we primarily target the Eagle Ford Shale and the Austin Chalk Trend. Recent Developments

Merger with Chesapeake Energy Corporation
 In February 2019, we were acquired by Chesapeake for approximately 717.3 million shares of Chesapeake common stock and $381.1 million in cash. Immediately following the completion of the acquisition, WildHorse Development merged with and into Brazos Valley Longhorn, L.L.C., a newly formed Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Chesapeake. Following the completion of the Merger on February 1, 2019, Brazos Valley Longhorn, L.L.C., as successor to WildHorse Development, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Chesapeake. Amendments to Credit Agreement
 On February 1, 2019, the Company, each of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries (each as a guarantor), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), and the lenders party thereto entered into a Sixth Amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement dated as of December 19, 2016, among the Company, the Administrative Agent and the other agents and lenders party thereto (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). Among other things, the Sixth Amendment (i) amended the merger covenant and the definition of change of control to permit the Merger and (ii) permits borrowings under the Credit Agreement to be used to redeem or repurchase the $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2025 issued by WildHorse (the “2025 Senior Notes”) so long as certain conditions are met.
 On October 15, 2018, the Company, each of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries (each as a guarantor), the Administrative Agent, and the lenders party thereto entered into a Fifth Amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The Fifth Amendment, among other things, modified the Credit Agreement to increase the borrowing base from $1.05 billion to $1.30 billion.
 On March 23, 2018, the Company, each of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries (each as a guarantor), the Administrative Agent, and the lenders party thereto entered into a Fourth Amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement.  The Fourth Amendment, among other things, modified the Credit Agreement to increase the borrowing base from $875.0 million to $1.05 billion.
 WildHorse Senior Notes
 As a result of the completion of the Merger, Brazos Valley Longhorn, L.L.C. assumed the obligations under the 2025 Senior Notes and Brazos Valley Longhorn Finance Corp. (“BVL Finance Corp.”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Brazos Valley Longhorn, L.L.C. became a co-issuer of the 2025 Senior Notes.
 The 2025 Senior Notes are the senior unsecured obligations of Brazos Valley Longhorn, L.L.C., BVL Finance Corp. and the other BVL Guarantors. The 2025 Senior Notes will not be obligations of Chesapeake or any of its subsidiaries other than Brazos Valley Longhorn, L.L.C., BVL Finance Corp. and the other BVL Guarantors. The 2025 Senior Notes will rank equally in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of Brazos Valley Longhorn, L.L.C., BVL Finance Corp. and the other BVL Guarantors, and will be effectively subordinated to Brazos Valley Longhorn L.L.C.’s, BVL Finance Corp.’s and the other BVL Guarantors’ senior secured indebtedness, including their obligations

under WildHorse Development’s revolving credit facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness.
 April 2018 Issuance of Additional 2025 Senior Notes
 On April 20, 2018, we completed a private placement of an additional $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Senior Notes (the “April Notes”).  The April Notes are treated as a single class of debt securities with the other outstanding 2025 Senior Notes.  The April Notes were issued at a price of 102% of par. This issuance resulted in net proceeds of approximately $201.0 million, after deducting the initial purchaser’s discount and commissions and estimated offering expenses and excluding accrued interest.  We used the net proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. On September 24, 2018, all of the then-outstanding 2025 Senior Notes, including the April Notes, were exchanged for an equal principal amount of registered 6.875% senior notes due 2025 pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-4. North Louisiana Divestiture
 On February 12, 2018, WHR II entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Tanos for the sale of all of our producing and non-producing oil and natural gas properties, including Oakfield, primarily located in Webster, Claiborne, Lincoln, Jackson and Ouachita Parishes, Louisiana (“NLA Assets”).  On March 29, 2018, we completed the sale of the NLA Assets for a preliminary sales price of approximately $206.4 million.   Including final purchase price adjustments of $4.8 million, the final sales price of $211.2 million has been fully collected at December 31, 2018.   The Company has paid $3.8 million in expenses related to the divestiture and has received $0.4 million in contingent payments from Tanos.
 In addition, we may receive contingent payments of up to $35.0 million based on the number of wells spud on such properties over the next three years.  We have made an accounting policy election to record the contingent consideration when it is deemed to be realizable.  In October 2018, we received contingent payments of $0.4 million from Tanos.
 Our NLA Assets were deemed to meet held-for-sale accounting criteria as of February 12, 2018, at which point we ceased recording depletion and depreciation. Based on the Company’s sale proceeds after preliminary customary purchase price adjustments, we recorded an impairment charge of $214.3 million during the first quarter of 2018 to adjust the carrying amount of the disposal group to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. See “Note 3—Acquisitions and Divestitures” of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report for additional information.
 Development of In-field Sand Mine
 On February 12, 2018, we announced that Burleson Sand LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, had previously acquired surface and sand rights on approximately 727 acres in Burleson County, Texas to construct and operate an in-field sand mine. Total capital expenditure for 2018 for the development of the sand mine was approximately $66.1 million. The sand mine commenced operations in February 2019. Our Properties
 Eagle Ford Acreage
 We currently target a portion of the Eagle Ford Shale at depths between 6,000 feet and 13,000 feet primarily in Burleson, Lee, Brazos and Washington Counties, Texas. 
 We have completed multiple bolt-on acquisitions and in-fill leases to build our current position in the Eagle Ford Shale and have identified a substantial inventory of drilling locations across Burleson, Brazos, Lee, Robertson and Washington Counties.
 As of December 31, 2018, our Eagle Ford Acreage included approximately 419,293 net acres.

 Reserve Data
 Preparation of Reserve Estimates
 Our reserve estimates as of December 31, 2018 included in this Annual Report are based on evaluations prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“CG&A”), a third-party engineering firm in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC.
 Proved reserves are reserves which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. If deterministic methods are used, the term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, there should at least be a 90% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. The technical and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, well-test data, production data (including flow rates), well data (including lateral lengths), historical price and cost information, and property ownership interests. Reserve engineers use this technical data, together with standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a combination of methods, including performance analysis, volumetric analysis, and analogy. The proved developed reserves and EURs per well are estimated using performance analysis and volumetric analysis. The estimates of the proved developed reserves and EURs for each developed well are used to estimate the proved undeveloped reserves for each proved undeveloped location (utilizing type curves, statistical analysis, and analogy).
 Internal Controls
 We maintain adequate and effective internal controls over the reserve estimation process as well as the underlying data upon which reserve estimates are based. Our internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals work closely with CG&A reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to CG&A. Periodically, our technical team meets with CG&A reserve engineers to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used to prepare reserve estimates.
 Reserve engineering is and must be recognized as a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. As a result, the estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of economically recoverable oil, natural gas and NGLs and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions, all of which may vary from actual results, including geologic interpretation, prices and future production rates and costs. Please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors” appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, our reserve estimates and related reports were prepared by CG&A and reviewed by our Corporate Reserves Department and approved by our Director – Corporate Reserves who is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves work conducted by third-party engineering firms. Her qualifications include the following:

· | Over 15 years of practical experience in the oil and gas industry, with 12 years in reservoir engineering;

--+---------------------------------------------------------------

  CG&A was founded in 1961 and performs petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-693. Within CG&A, the technical person primarily responsible for preparing the estimates shown herein, was Todd Brooker. Mr. Brooker has been an employee of CG&A since 1992. His responsibilities include reserve and economic evaluations, fair market valuations, field studies, pipeline resource studies and acquisition/divestiture analysis. His reserve reports are routinely used for public company SEC disclosures. His experience includes significant projects in both conventional and unconventional resources in North America and worldwide, including oil and gas shale plays. Mr. Brooker graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Texas at Austin in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering, and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. He is also a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers.
 Estimated Proved Reserves
 The following table presents the estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2018, based on our audited reserve report.

 | Oil | Natural Gas | NGLs | Total 
 | (MBbls) | (MMcf) | (MBbls) | (MBoe) 
Estimated Proved Reserves | | | | 
Total Proved Developed | 66,398 | 88,936 | 14,135 | 95,356 
Total Proved Undeveloped | 218,868 | 289,237 | 43,620 | 310,694
Total Proved Reserves | 285,266 | 378,173 | 57,755 | 406,050

      Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 310.7 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves consisting of 218.9 MMBbls of oil, 289.2 Bcf of natural gas and 43.6 MMBbls of NGLs, compared to 339.8 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2017, consisting of 217.8 MMbbls of oil, 462.3 Bcf of natural gas and 45.0 MMBbls of NGLs. None of our PUDs as of December 31, 2018 are scheduled to be developed on a date more than five years from the date the reserves were initially booked to PUDs. PUDs will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production.
 Our PUDs changed during 2018 as a result of:

· | downward performance and price revisions of 69.1 MMBoe;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | acquisitions of 0.5 MMBoe;
--+---------------------------


· | divestures of 40.0 MMBoe;
--+--------------------------


· | reserve additions of 86.8 MMBoe; and
--+-------------------------------------


· | transfers to proved developed producing of 7.3 MMBoe
--+-----------------------------------------------------

  We estimate that we incurred $80.9 million to convert proved undeveloped reserves from 13 locations into proved developed reserves in 2018.

      Reconciliation of PV‑10 to Standardized Measure
 PV‑10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and differs from the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. PV‑10 is a computation of the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows on a pre-tax basis. PV‑10 is equal to the Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10 percent. We believe that the presentation of PV‑10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties. PV‑10, however, is not a substitute for the Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. Our PV‑10 measure and the Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves.

 The following table provides a reconciliation of PV‑10 of our proved reserves to the Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:

 | At December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016

      Productive Wells
 Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities. Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we own an interest, and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells. The following table sets forth information relating to the productive wells in which we owned a working interest as of December 31, 2018.
 | Oil | Natural Gas
 | | | Average | | | Average 
 | Gross | Net | Working | Gross | Net | Working 
 | Wells | Wells | Interest | Wells | Wells | Interest
Eagle Ford Acreage | | | | | | 
Operated | 942.0 | 901.7 | 95.7% | 53.0 | 48.0 | 90.6% 
Non-operated | 212.0 | 30.9 | 14.6% | 30.0 | 6.3 | 21.0% 
Total | 1,154.0 | 932.6 | 80.8% | 83.0 | 54.3 | 65.4% 

      Acreage
 The following table sets forth certain information regarding the total developed and undeveloped acreage in which we owned an interest as of December 31, 2018.

 | Developed Acres | Undeveloped Acres | Total Acres
Region | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net 
Eagle Ford Acreage | 33,106 | 28,066 | 438,141 | 297,605 | 471,247 | 325,671

      Approximately 74% of our net Eagle Ford Acreage was held by production at December 31, 2018. 
 Undeveloped Acreage Expirations
 The following table sets forth the number of total net undeveloped acres as of December 31, 2018 across our Eagle Ford Acreage that will expire in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage prior to the expiration dates or unless such leasehold rights are extended or renewed.
Region | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023
Eagle Ford Acreage | 31,031 | 27,616 | 12,434 | 552 | 20 

      We intend to extend substantially all of the net acreage associated with our drilling locations through a combination of development drilling and leasehold extension and renewal payments. 
 Drilling Activities
 The following table summarizes our approximate gross and net interest in wells completed during the periods indicated (including both operated and non-operated wells), regardless of when drilling was initiated. The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation 

 
  15

 
among the number of productive wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value. A dry well is a well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion. A productive well is a well that is not a dry well. Completion refers to installation of permanent equipment for production of oil or gas, or, in the case of a dry well, to reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned.

      At December 31, 2018, 27.0 gross (25.9 net) wells (including wells temporarily suspended) were in the process of being drilled. We are currently running a four-rig program in our Eagle Ford Acreage, which we are utilizing on a well-to-well basis. We are not currently a party to any long-term drilling rig contracts. We plan to operate an average of four drilling rigs in the Eagle Ford Shale and Austin Chalk Trend in 2019.
 Major Customers
 The following table sets forth the percentage of our revenues attributed to our customers who have accounted for 10% or more of our revenues during 2018, 2017 and 2016.

 | For the Year Ended December 31, | 
Major Customers | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. and subsidiaries | 49 | % | 56 | % | 63 | %
Koch Industries, Inc. | 19 | % | 4 | % | n/a | 
Royal Dutch Shell plc and subsidiaries | 18 | % | 21 | % | 12 | %
Cima Energy LTD | n/a | | n/a | | 15 | %

      Based on the current demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs and the availability of other purchasers, we believe that the loss of any such purchaser would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 Competition
 We compete with both major integrated and other independent oil and natural gas companies in all aspects of our business to explore, develop and operate our properties and market our production. Some of our competitors may have larger financial and other resources than us. Competitive conditions may be affected by future legislation and regulations as the United States develops new energy and climate-related policies. In addition, some of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices, domestic and foreign political conditions, weather conditions, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and overall economic conditions. We also face indirect competition from alternative energy sources, including wind and solar power. We believe that our 

 
  16

 
technological expertise, combined with our exploration, land, drilling and production capabilities and the experience of our management team, enables us to compete effectively.
 Seasonality of Business
 Weather conditions can affect the demand for, and prices of, oil, natural gas and NGLs. Demand for natural gas is typically higher in the fourth and first quarters resulting in higher prices while the demand for oil is typically higher during the second and third quarters. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on an annual basis. Title to Properties
 We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material assets. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties or materially interfere with our use of these properties in the operation of our business. In addition, we believe that we have obtained sufficient rights-of-way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for us to operate our business in all material respects as described in this Annual Report. Public Policy and Government Regulation
 All of our operations are conducted onshore in the United States. Our industry is subject to a wide range of regulations, laws, rules, taxes, fees and other policy implementation actions that have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or expansion. Numerous government agencies have issued extensive regulations which are binding on our industry, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability. Additionally, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered.  We actively monitor regulatory developments applicable to our industry in order to anticipate, design and implement required compliance activities and systems.  The following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations. Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters

  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of remedial liabilities, fines, or criminal penalties or to injunctions limiting our operations in affected areas. Moreover, multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits which allow environmental organizations to act in the place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law. We consider the costs of environmental protection and of safety and health compliance to be necessary, manageable parts of our business. We have been able to plan for and comply with environmental, safety and health initiatives without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures. However, based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws, our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to compliance with the protection of the environment, safety and health have increased over the years and may continue to increase. We cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters.
 Our operations are also subject to conservation regulations, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit, the rate of production allowable from oil and gas wells, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In the United States., some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration.  Other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, federal and state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and state conservation laws impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. These regulations limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.
 Regulatory proposals in some states and local communities have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations.  Federal and state agencies have continued to assess the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, which could spur further action toward federal, state and/or local

legislation and regulation.  Further restrictions of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities from our properties.
 Certain of our U.S. natural gas and oil leases are granted or approved by the federal government and administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) of the Department of the Interior. Such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate, among other matters, drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government. The federal government has been particularly active in recent years in evaluating and, in some cases, promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding, venting and flaring, oil and gas measurement and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands. In addition, permitting activities on federal lands are subject to frequent delays.
 Delays in obtaining permits or an inability to obtain new permits or permit renewals could inhibit our ability to execute our drilling and production plans. Failure to comply with applicable regulations or permit requirements could result in revocation of our permits, inability to obtain new permits and the imposition of fines and penalties.
 Related Permits and Authorizations
 Many environmental laws require us to obtain permits or other authorizations from state and/or federal agencies before initiating certain drilling, construction, production, operation or other oil and natural gas activities, and to maintain these permits and compliance with their requirements for on-going operations. These permits are generally subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can in certain cases delay or halt projects and cease production or operation of wells, pipelines and other operations. Related Insurance
 We maintain insurance against some risks associated with above or underground contamination that may occur as a result of our development activities. However, this insurance is limited to activities at the well site and there can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or that this insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. Further, we have no coverage for gradual, long-term pollution events. Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 197 full-time employees. We hire independent contractors on an as needed basis. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees. We believe that our employee relationships are satisfactory. Legal Proceedings
 We are party to lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict the outcome of any such lawsuits with certainty, but management believes it is remote that pending or threatened legal matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.
 In January 2019, putative class action lawsuits in U.S. District Courts for the District of Delaware and Southern District of New York were filed against us and other defendants. The lawsuits generally allege various violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with the disclosure contained in the joint proxy statement/prospectus filed in connection with the Merger. The lawsuits seek rescission of the Merger or rescissory damages and, in each case, attorney's fees, costs and interest. We intend to vigorously defend these claims.
 Due to the nature of our business, we are, from time to time, involved in other routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities, including workers' compensation claims and employment related disputes. In the opinion of our management, none of these other pending litigation, disputes or claims against us, if decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.
