ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Overview and Corporate History
 
We are a therapeutic technology company focused on addressing unmet needs in global health and biodefense. In the field of infectious disease therapeutics, a majority of viruses that transmit human infections are not addressed with approved antiviral therapies. To address this significant unmet need, the Aethlon Hemopurifier® is an affinity hemofiltration device developed for the single-use elimination of life-threatening viruses from the human circulatory system. In the United States, we are advancing the Hemopurifier under a “Breakthrough Device” designation from The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 
Under the “Breakthrough Device” program, the FDA has permitted the proposed “Indication for Use” for our device to include: “The Hemopurifier is a single-use device indicated for the treatment of life-threatening glycosylated viruses that are not addressed with an approved therapy.” We are currently in discussions with FDA to determine the pathway to clinically advance this “Indication for Use” under the “Breakthrough Device” program.
 
The “Indication for Use” under the “Breakthrough Device” program also aligns with our goal to fulfill the broad-spectrum countermeasure objective set forth by the U.S. Government to protect citizens from life-threatening bioterror and pandemic threat viruses that are not addressed with approved therapies. Based on previous human treatment outcomes, we believe our Hemopurifier may also augment the benefit of approved antiviral drug agents.
 
In human studies, the Hemopurifier has been administered to individuals infected with the following glycosylated viruses: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis-C Virus (HCV) and Ebola Virus (EBV). Additionally, the Hemopurifier has been validated in vitro to capture a broad-spectrum of glycosylated viral threats including; Marburg virus, Zika virus, Lassa virus, MERS-CoV, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Herpes Simplex virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus, Smallpox related viruses, H1N1 Swine Flu virus, H5N1 Bird Flu virus, and the reconstructed Spanish flu virus of 1918. In many cases, these validations were conducted in collaboration with leading government or non-government research institutes.
 
In collaboration with the FDA, we are focused on the clinical advancement of our Hemopurifier in the U.S. In March of 2017, we concluded an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) feasibility study that was previously approved by FDA. The feasibility study demonstrated safety of our device in health-compromised dialysis patients infected with HCV. The protocol of the IDE study was originally recommended by FDA as a surrogate model to advance the Hemopurifier as a broad-spectrum candidate to treat virulent viruses that are often classified as bioterror or pandemic threats. Prior to FDA approval of our IDE feasibility study, we conducted several clinical studies in virally infected individuals outside of the U.S.
 
In September of 2017, our Hemopurifier received an Expedited Access Pathway (EAP) program designation from FDA to support an accelerated clinical advancement of our device. Subsequent to the EAP designation, the Hemopurifier was transitioned to the “Breakthrough Device” program that was established under the 21st Century Cures Act, which was signed into law in December of 2016.
 
We are also investigating the ability of the Hemopurifier to capture glycosylated bacterial toxins and tumor-derived exosomes that promote cancer progression and treatment resistance. Additionally, we are the majority owner of Exosome Sciences, Inc. (ESI), a Company that is focused on the discovery of exosomal biomarkers to diagnose and monitor life-threatening disease conditions that may be current or future therapeutic targets for Aethlon Medical.
 
We (Aethlon Medical, Inc.) were formed on March 10, 1999. Our executive offices are located at 9635 Granite Ridge Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92123. Our telephone number is (858) 459-7800. All references to “us” or “we” are references to Aethlon Medical, Inc., combined with its majority-owned subsidiary, Exosome Sciences, Inc.

The Mechanism of the Hemopurifier
 
The Aethlon Hemopurifier is an affinity hemofiltration device designed for the single-use removal of life-threatening viruses from the human circulatory system. In the United States, the Hemopurifier is classified as a combination product whose regulatory jurisdiction is The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the branch of FDA responsible for the premarket approval of all medical devices.
 
In application, our Hemopurifier is deployed for use on the established infrastructure of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and dialysis instruments located in hospitals and clinics worldwide. Incorporated within the Hemopurifier is an active affinity lectin that binds to a glycosylated structure with which infectious viruses cloak themselves to evade the surveillance of the immune system as a means to promote replication of progeny viruses. In mechanism, the Hemopurifier eliminates circulatory viruses prior to cell infection as a means to interrupt the replication of progeny viruses.
 
We have demonstrated that the Hemopurifier affinity mechanism provides for the capture of a broad-spectrum of strains, species and families of viral pathogens. We are also investigating the utility of our Hemopurifier to capture glycosylated bacterial toxins as well as circulating tumor-derived exosomes that promote cancer progression and treatment resistance.
 
The Hemopurifier - U.S. Clinical Trials
    On March 13, 2017, we concluded an FDA-approved Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) feasibility study of Hemopurifier therapy. In the study, safety of the Hemopurifier was demonstrated in health-compromised individuals infected with a viral pathogen. Based on guidance from FDA, the study served as a surrogate model to advance our device as a broad-spectrum treatment countermeasure against highly virulent viruses that are often considered bioterror or pandemic threats. The feasibility study was conducted on Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected dialysis patients at DaVita MedCenter Dialysis in Houston, Texas. The principal investigator of the study was Dr. Ronald Ralph. We reported that there were no device-related adverse events in enrolled subjects who met the study inclusion-exclusion criteria. We also reported that an average capture of 154 million copies of HCV (in International Units, I.U.) within the Hemopurifier® during 4-hour treatments. The FDA approved the IDE feasibility study protocol in June of 2013. Prior to this approval, we collected supporting Hemopurifier data through investigational human studies conducted overseas.
The Hemopurifier – Clinical Trials Conducted Overseas
 
EBOLA Virus
 
In December of 2014, Time Magazine named the Hemopurifier® a “Top 25 Invention” as the result of treating an ebola-infected physician at Frankfurt University Hospital in Germany. The physician was comatose with multiple organ failure at the time of treatment with the Hemopurifier®. At the American Society of Nephrology Annual Meeting, Dr. Helmut Geiger, Chief of Nephrology at Frankfurt University Hospital reported that the patient received a single 6.5 hour Hemopurifier® treatment. Prior to treatment, viral load was measured at 400,000 c/ml. Post-treatment viral load at reported to be 1,000 c/ml. Dr. Geiger also reported that 242 million copies of Ebola virus were measured to be captured within the Hemopurifier® during treatment. The patient made a full recovery.
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
 
Prior to FDA approval of the IDE feasibility study, we conducted investigational HCV treatment studies at the Apollo Hospital, Fortis Hospital and the Medanta Medicity Institute in India. The treatment protocol of the studies conducted at the Apollo and Fortis Hospital was similar to what had been proposed in our IDE feasibility study submission to FDA. Whereas the Medanta Medicity study was conducted to demonstrate the ability of the Hemopurifier to be combined with an established HCV drug regimen.

In the Medanta Medicity Institute study, twelve HCV-infected individuals were enrolled to receive three six-hour Hemopurifier treatments during the first three days of a 48-week peginterferon+ribavirin treatment regimen. The study was conducted under the leadership of Dr. Vijay Kher at the Medanta Medicity Institute. Dr. Kher’s staff reported that Hemopurifier therapy was well tolerated and without device-related adverse events in the twelve treated patients.
 
Of these twelve patients, ten completed the Hemopurifier-peginterferon+ribavirin treatment protocol, including eight genotype-1 patients and two genotype-3 patients. Eight of the ten patients achieved a sustained virologic response, which is the clinical definition of treatment cure and is defined as undetectable HCV in the blood 24 weeks after the completion of the 48-week peginterferon+ribavirin drug regimen. Both genotype-3 patients achieved a sustained virologic response, while six of the eight genotype-1 patients achieved a sustained virologic response.
 
Of the ten patients who completed the full treatment protocol, five also achieved a rapid virologic response, defined as undetectable HCV in the blood at day 30 of therapy. Rapid virologic response represents the clinical endpoint that best predicts sustained virologic response cure rates resulting from peginterferon+ribavirin therapy. As a point of reference, the landmark Individualized Dosing Efficacy vs Flat Dosing to Assess Optimal Pegylated Interferon Therapy study of 3,070 HCV genotype-1 patients documented that 10.35% (n=318/3070) of peginterferon+ribavirin-treated patients achieved a rapid virologic response. Patients who achieved a rapid virologic response had sustained virologic response rates of 86.2% (n=274/318) versus sustained virologic response rates of 32.5% (n=897/2752) in non-rapid virologic response patients.  Two of the genotype-1 patients who achieved a rapid virologic response also achieved an immediate virologic response, defined as undetectable HCV in the blood seven days after initiation of Hemopurifier-peginterferon+ribavirin treatment protocol. The earliest measured report of undetectable HCV in blood in the Individualized Dosing Efficacy vs Flat Dosing to Assess Optimal Pegylated Interferon Therapy study was on day 14 of the study.
 
Data from two patients was not included in the reported Hemopurifier-peginterferon+ribavirin dataset. One of these patients was a genotype-5 patient who discontinued peginterferon+ribavirin therapy at day 180, yet still achieved a sustained virologic response. The second patient was a genotype-3 patient who also achieved a sustained virologic response, yet was unable to tolerate peginterferon+ribavirin therapy and discontinued therapy at day 90. Overall, ten of the twelve patients who enrolled in the study achieved a sustained virologic response and seven of the twelve patients achieved a rapid virologic response.
 
Hemopurifier - Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
 
In addition to treating Ebola and HCV-infected individuals, we also conducted a single proof-of-principle treatment study at the Sigma New Life Hospital related to the treatment of HIV-infected AIDS patient who was not be administered HIV antiviral drug agents. In the study, Hemopurifier therapy reduced viral load by 93% as the result of 12 Hemopurifier treatments (each four hours in duration) that were administered over the course of one month.
Exosome Sciences, Inc. – Majority Owned Biomarker Discovery Company
 
We are the majority owner of Exosome Sciences, Inc. (ESI), a Company focused on the discovery of exosomal biomarkers to diagnose and monitor life-threatening disease conditions that may be current or future therapeutic targets for Aethlon Medical. At present, the priority of ESI is directed toward exosomal biomarkers to diagnose and monitor cancer and neurological disorders.
 
Since it began operations in 2013, ESI researchers disclosed the discovery of an exosomal biomarker that may be associated with neurological tauopathies, which involve the abnormal accumulation of tau protein in the brain. Tauopathies are a family of 21 different neurological disorders that include Alzheimer's disease and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE).  Related to CTE, the ESI team was invited to participate in an NIH-funded research study with The Boston University CTE Center. In the study, ESI researchers investigated an exosomal tau biomarker (TauSome) as a candidate to diagnose and monitor CTE in living individuals. At present, CTE can only be diagnosed through post-mortem brain autopsy.

The results of the study indicated that TauSome levels (in blood) of former professional American football players (high CTE risk group) were significantly higher as compared to same-age group control subjects who did not participate in activities that involved repetitive head trauma. Additionally, high TauSome levels also correlated with poor performance in cognitive decline testing. These results were published in an article entitled “Preliminary Study of Plasma Exosomal Tau as a Potential Biomarker for Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy” in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease on April 12, 2016.
 
To further validate these observations, ESI has initiated a follow-on study to evaluate TauSome levels in up to 200 former professional football players and control subjects. If fully enrolled, the study would be the largest study to date related to the advancement of a candidate biomarker to diagnose and monitor CTE in the living. Enrollment of study participants began in March 2018 at the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGEN) in Phoenix, AZ. Kendall Van Keuren-Jensen, Ph.D., Co-Director of TGEN’s Center for Noninvasive Diagnostics is the principal investigator at this site location. Dr. Van Keuren-Jensen is neurodegenerative disease thought leader whose research includes discovery and detection of biomarkers for central nervous system disorders. Additional site locations are anticipated.
 
U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
 
We are a proven performer under U.S. Government Contracts. We recently completed two Department of Defense (DOD) contracts with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) related to the treatment of sepsis and other disease conditions. In these programs, we completed 29 out of 29 milestone opportunities, which generated approximately $6 million of revenue for our Company.
 
National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) 
 
At present, we are operating under a National Institutes of Health (NIH) contract with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) related to the study of our Hemopurifier to capture tumor-derived exosomes. We entered into this contract on September 15, 2017. This contract award is under the NIH’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program and is entitled: SBIR Topic 359 Phase 1 Device Strategy for Selective Isolation of Oncosomes and Non-Malignant Exosomes. The contract award is a firm, fixed-price contract with potential total payments of $299,250 over the course of nine months.
 
Fixed price contracts require the achievement of multiple, incremental milestones to receive the full award during each period of the contract. The NIH also has the unilateral right to require us to perform additional work under an option period for an additional fixed amount of $49,800. Under the terms of the contract, we must perform certain incremental work towards the achievement of specific milestones against which we will invoice the government for fixed payment amounts.
 
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, we performed work under the contract completing the majority of the first two technical objectives of the contract (Aim 1: To validate the Hemopurifier as a device for capture and recovery of melanoma exosomes from plasma and Aim 2: To validate a method of melanoma exosome isolation consisting of the Hemopurifier followed by mab-based immunocapture to select out the tumor-derived exosomes from non-malignant exosomes). As a result we invoiced NIH for $149,625.
 
Upon completion of this contract award, we plan to submit a Phase 2 contract proposal under the program. If awarded, the Phase 2 SBIR would pay $1.5 million over two years.
 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”) 
 
We entered into a contract with DARPA on September 30, 2011. Under the DARPA award, we have been engaged to develop a therapeutic device to reduce the incidence of sepsis, a fatal bloodstream infection that often results in the death of combat-injured soldiers. The award from DARPA was a fixed-price contract with potential total payments to us of $6,794,389 over the course of five years. Fixed price contracts require the achievement of multiple, incremental milestones to receive the full award during each year of the contract. Under the terms of the contract, we performed certain incremental work towards the achievement of specific milestones against which we invoiced the government for fixed payment amounts.

Originally, only the base year (year one of the contract) was effective for the parties; however, DARPA subsequently exercised its option on the remaining years of the contract. The milestones were comprised of planning, engineering and clinical targets, the achievement of which in some cases required the participation and contribution of third-party participants under the contract. We commenced work under the contract in October 2011 and completed the contract in September 2016.
 
In February 2014, DARPA reduced the scope of our contract in years three through five of the contract. The reduction in scope focused our research on exosomes, viruses and blood processing instrumentation. This scope reduction reduced the possible payments under the contract by $858,469 over years three through five.
 
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we invoiced the U.S. Government for the final two milestones under our DARPA contract in the aggregate amount of $387,438. As the DARPA contract was completed on September 30, 2016, we do not expect to record any future revenue related to that contract.
 
Subcontract with Battelle Memorial Institute
 
We entered into a subcontract agreement with Battelle in March 2013. Battelle was chosen by DARPA to be the prime contractor on the systems integration portion of the original DARPA contract, and we were one of several subcontractors on that systems integration project. The Battelle subcontract was under a time and materials basis, and we began generating revenues under the subcontract in the three months ended September 30, 2013. That contract has now concluded. The Battelle subcontract was our first cost-reimbursable contract.
 
Our revenue under this contract was a function of cost reimbursement plus an overhead mark-up for hours devoted to the project by specific employees (with specific hourly rates for those employees), for travel expenses related to the project, for any equipment purchased for the project and for the cost of any consultants hired by us to perform work on the project. Each payment required approval by the program manager at Battelle.
 
Research and Development Costs
 
A substantial portion of our operating budget is used for research and development activities. The cost of research and development, all of which has been charged to operations, amounted to approximately $586,000 and $673,000 in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Intellectual Property
 
We currently own or have license rights to a number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications and endeavor to continually improve our intellectual property position. We consider the protection of our technology, whether owned or licensed, to the exclusion of use by others, to be vital to our business. While we intend to focus primarily on patented or patentable technology, we may also rely on trade secrets, unpatented property, know-how, regulatory exclusivity, patent extensions and continuing technological innovation to develop our competitive position. We also own certain trademarks.

Under certain circumstances, ownership of the patents may revert to the London Health Science Center Research, Inc. if there is an uncured substantial breach of the assignment agreement.
 
Industry & Competition
 
The industry for treating infectious disease and cancer is extremely competitive, and companies developing new treatment procedures face significant capital and regulatory challenges. As our Hemopurifier is a clinical-stage device, we have the additional challenge of establishing medical industry support, which will be driven by treatment data resulting from human clinical studies. Should our device become market cleared by FDA or the regulatory body of another country, we may face significant competition from well-funded pharmaceutical organizations. Additionally, we would likely need to establish large-scale production of our device in order to be competitive. We believe that our Hemopurifier is a first-in-class therapeutic candidate and we are not aware of any affinity hemofiltration device being market cleared in any country for the single-use removal of circulating viruses or tumor-derived exosomes.
Government Regulation of Medical Devices
 
The Hemopurifier is subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies, primarily the FDA, and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, storage, distribution, advertising and promotion, and post-marketing surveillance reporting of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation program be conducted before a device receives approval for commercial distribution. Failure to obtain approval or clearance to market our product and products under development and to meet the ongoing requirements of these regulatory authorities could prevent us from commercializing the Hemopurifier and future products in the U.S. and elsewhere.
Hemopurifier Investigational Device Exemption and Supplement
 
In 2013, the FDA approved our investigational device exemption to initiate human clinical studies in the U.S. as a feasibility study entitled “A Clinical Safety Study of the Aethlon Hemopurifier® in Chronic ESRD Patients With HCV Infection.” We were required to reach agreement with the internal review board of DaVita MedCenter Dialysis prior to beginning our U.S. clinical trial. We are also required to obtain patients' informed consent that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy regulations. We, the FDA or the internal review board at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of the product. The investigational device exemption is part of the FDA’s clearance process. This process is discussed in detail in the “Pre-Marketing Regulations in the U.S.” section below.
 
In December 2014, the FDA approved our request for a supplement to our investigational device exemption to establish a protocol to clinically investigate the use of the Hemopurifier for the treatment of Ebola-infected patients in the U.S. Under the supplement, we may treat up to 20 Ebola-infected persons, at no more than 10 institutions in the U.S., using the supplement protocol; however, this is not a clinical trial. We must clearly distinguish data collected in the supplement protocol from data collected in our IDE feasibility study (discussed above). Prior to treating Ebola-infected patients, we must comply with specified patient protection procedures established by the applicable institution including its institutional review board. Also, we must report any unanticipated device-related adverse events resulting from the supplement protocol to the FDA within 10 working days. Even if the protocol is established, and patients are treated, the results of such treatments may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device.
 
DaVita MedCenter Dialysis treated a total of eight patients per the IDE feasibility study protocol and then notified us that it was unlikely that they would be able to locate additional subjects who would meet the study inclusion criteria. Therefore on April 11, 2017, we notified the FDA that we were concluding the trial with the eight patients treated. The FDA accepted that decision to terminate the trial with eight patients completed. We subsequently submitted preliminary and final clinical study reports, which were accepted by FDA.

Pre-Marketing Regulations in the U.S.
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device distributed commercially in the U.S. requires either prior 510(k) clearance or premarket approval, or PMA, from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Class I devices are subject to only general controls, such as establishment registration and device listing, labeling, medical device reporting, and prohibitions against adulteration and misbranding. Class II medical devices generally require prior 510(k) clearance before they may be commercially marketed in the U.S. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, are placed in Class III, generally requiring submission of a PMA supported by clinical trial data.
 
In the United States, our Hemopurifier is classified as a combination product whose regulatory jurisdiction is The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the branch of FDA responsible for the premarket approval of all medical devices. It is anticipated that the Hemopurifier will generally require the submission of a PMA supported by clinical trial data. In the future, we may develop new therapeutic candidates that are considered 510(k), Class II or Class III products.
 
510(k) Clearance Pathway
 
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a premarket notification must be submitted to FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications. FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months, but it can take significantly longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, require premarket approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k), or a premarket approval, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. If the FDA requires a 510(k) holder to seek 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for any modifications to a previously cleared product, the 510(k) holder also may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until this clearance or approval is obtained.
 
Premarket Approval Pathway
 
A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to data obtained from technical, preclinical and clinical studies and relating to manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device.
 
After a PMA submission is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application and begin an in-depth review, which generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA will typically request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with Quality System Regulation, or QSR. New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.

Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA. To perform a clinical trial in the U.S. for a significant risk device, FDA requires the device sponsor to file an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trial. An IDE amendment or supplement must also be submitted before initiating a significant change to the clinical protocol or device under an existing IDE. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, and any available data on human clinical experience, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound.
 
The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients. Clinical trials conducted in the U.S. for significant risk devices may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, overseeing the welfare of the research subjects and responsible for that particular clinical trial. Under its regulations, the FDA responds to an IDE or an IDE amendment within 30 days. The FDA may approve the IDE or amendment, grant an approval with certain conditions, or identify deficiencies and request additional information. It is common for the FDA to require additional information before approving an IDE or amendment for a new trial, and thus final FDA approval on a submission may require more than the initial 30 days. The FDA may also require that a small-scale feasibility study be conducted before a pivotal trial may commence. In a feasibility trial, the FDA limits the number of patients, sites and investigators that may participate. Feasibility trials are typically structured to obtain information on safety and to help determine how large a pivotal trial should be to obtain statistically significant results.
 
Clinical trials are subject to extensive recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Our clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. We are also required to obtain the patients’ informed consent in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. We, the FDA or the IRB may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval to market the product in the U.S.
 
Post-Marketing Regulations in the U.S.
 
Should our Hemopurifier device be cleared for market use in the U.S. by the FDA, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

· | the FDA's Quality System Regulation which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or off-label uses; 
· | clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use; 
· | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
· | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action; and 
· | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.

The regulations also require that we report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury.
 
We will also be required to register with FDA as a medical device manufacturer within 30 days of commercial distribution of our products and must obtain all necessary state permits or licenses to operate our business. As a manufacturer, we are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by FDA to determine our compliance with quality system regulation and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:
 

· | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; 
· | customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds; 
· | recall, detention or seizure of our products; 
· | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
· | refusing or delaying our requests for premarket approval of new products or modified products;
· | operating restrictions; 
· | withdrawing PMA approvals that have already been granted; 
· | refusal to grant export approval for our products; or 
· | criminal prosecution. 

Compliance with U.S. Health Care Laws
 
Should our Hemopurifier device be cleared for market use in the U.S. by the FDA, we must comply with various U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback regulations, as well as other healthcare laws in connection with the commercialization of our products. Fraud and abuse laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services and various state agencies.
 
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, as amended, prohibits persons, including a medical device manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly or willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for a service or product or the purchasing, ordering, arranging for, or recommending the ordering of, any service or product for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federal healthcare program. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between medical device manufacturers on one hand and healthcare providers on the other. The term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, such as cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, waiver of payments, credit arrangements, ownership interests, the furnishing of services, supplies or equipment, and the provision of anything at less than its fair market value. Courts have broadly interpreted the scope of the law, holding that it may be violated if merely one purpose of an arrangement is to induce referrals, irrespective of the existence of other legitimate purposes. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act or ACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. In addition to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, many states have their own anti-kickback laws. Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they do not always have the same scope, exceptions, safe harbors or sanctions. In some states, these anti-kickback laws apply not only to payments made by government healthcare programs but also to payments made by other third-party payors, including commercial insurance companies.

We may also be subject to various federal and state marketing laws, such as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which generally require certain types of expenditures in the U.S. and the particular states to be tracked and reported. The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, maintenance of a payments database, and public reporting of the payment data. Device manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to track and report such payments. Moreover, several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and medical device companies to establish marketing compliance programs or even prohibit providing meals to prescribers or other marketing related activities. Compliance with such requirements may require investment in infrastructure to ensure that tracking and reporting is performed properly. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated.
 
International Regulation
 
International development and sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may be significantly different. At present, we are not seeking market clearance of our device in any region beyond the United States.
Manufacturing
 
Manufacturing of our Hemopurifier occurs in collaboration with a contract manufacturer based in San Diego, California that is compliant with the Good Manufacturing Practice regulations promulgated by the FDA. Our contract manufacturer is registered with the FDA. Previously, we did receive an export license from FDA that allows for the export of our Hemopurifier to support clinical studies in India. To date, our manufacture of the Hemopurifier has been limited to quantities necessary to support our clinical studies.
Sources and Suppliers
 
We are not dependent on any specific vendors for the materials used in our Hemopurifier. The key raw materials in the Hemopurifier include the affinity lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, pharmaceutical grade diatomaceous earth, plasmapheresis cartridges and certain chemical binding agents. The affinity lectin is available from several life science supply companies in the U.S. Diatomaceous earth is available from several life science supply companies in the U.S. To date, we have purchased plasmapheresis cartridges from one vendor in Europe however similar cartridges are commercially available from vendors on a worldwide basis should that European vendor cease to be available for any reason, including prohibitive pricing. The chemical binding agents are available from several life science supply companies on a worldwide basis. We typically purchase our raw materials on purchase order basis. Therefore, we remain subject to risks of supply shortages and price increases that potentially could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results if and when we begin large-scale manufacture of the Hemopurifier.
 
The key raw materials used by Exosome Sciences, Inc. in its research are blood samples supplied by research partners and a number of chemical and lab products commercially available from vendors on a worldwide basis. Exosome Sciences, Inc. is not dependent on any specific vendors for the materials used in its research activities.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We do not currently have any sales and marketing capability. With respect to commercialization efforts in the future, we intend to build or contract for distribution, sales and marketing capabilities for any product candidate that is approved. From time to time, we have had and are having strategic discussions with potential collaboration partners for our product candidates, although no assurance can be given that we will be able to enter into one or more collaboration agreements for our product candidates on acceptable terms, if at all.

Product Liability
 
The risk of product liability claims, product recalls and associated adverse publicity is inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of medical products. We have limited clinical trial liability insurance coverage. We cannot assure you that future insurance coverage will be adequate or available. We may not be able to secure product liability insurance coverage on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed. Any liability for mandatory damages could exceed the amount of our coverage. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product recall could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future product candidates.
Employees
 
We have six full-time employees consisting of our Chief Executive Officer, our President, our Chief Financial Officer, two research scientists and an executive assistant. We utilize, whenever appropriate, consultants in order to conserve cash and resources.
 
We believe our employee relations are good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective-bargaining agreements.
