Our Strategy
 Our strategy is built upon our vision of enabling smarter care at virtually every point of the healthcare continuum. Given the breadth of our portfolio and global client base, we are well positioned to connect providers to patients and payers across all healthcare settings. Smarter care is a strategic imperative for healthcare organizations globally and requires a balance between managing cost while maintaining the highest quality of care. Our solutions are positioned to facilitate the transformation in healthcare delivery by connecting communities, driving interoperability, providing data analytics, delivering consumer engagement features and assisting clients manage the evolution toward value-based care. These key strategic areas all help healthcare providers better manage populations of patients, especially those with costly chronic conditions, such as diabetes, asthma and heart disease, to help bring down the cost of care and improve patient outcomes.
 •Connecting communities – Our care coordination solutions improve safety and quality as a patient transitions from one care setting to another. To do so, care coordination solutions help build assessments, monitor results, track outcomes and make modifications in a patient’s care plan. Healthcare is a group effort and having full visibility into a patient’s care plan is critical. Access to comprehensive patient information is key, and our community solutions help create an organized, longitudinal patient record spanning all points of care.
 

•Interoperability – We provide clients a wide array of interoperability tools to support their need and desire to connect to numerous stakeholders in the industry, including other healthcare providers, labs, imaging facilities, public health entities and patients, as well as other third-party technology providers. Allscripts open platform is proven, scalable and user-friendly, and connects both clinical and financial data across every setting. We also offer Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”) based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. With this platform, clients can connect to any certified application or device, which saves time and money and gives clients full access to a variety of innovative solutions.
 •Data analytics – Allscripts understands that healthcare organizations need to analyze dependencies, trends and patterns so that they can develop business and clinical intelligence. Our analytics offerings help organizations better manage their patient populations by using clean data for better decisions at the point of care. Insights and analytics serve as the foundation for informed analysis and effective planning.
 •Consumer engagement – Our patient engagement software helps healthcare organizations achieve better outcomes, reduce emergency room visits and decrease hospitalizations. Our solutions also integrate with health IT offerings across an organization, regardless of a provider’s chosen vendor. With a patient engagement platform, individuals and their families have the opportunity to become active members of their care team, which improves results.
 •Payer and life sciences – Through Veradigm, we are positioned to help clients manage the evolution toward value-based care, facilitate patient medication access and affordability and provide new, efficient operating models for generating the real-world evidence necessary to accelerate the development of new therapies and to enhance the value of existing ones.
 Material Government Regulations
 Our business operations are worldwide and are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, and our products and services are governed by a number of rules and regulations. Although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws, rules and other regulations applicable to our operations, products or services will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate materially increased expenditures in response to government regulations or future material impacts to our results or competitiveness. Nonetheless, as discussed below, healthcare laws and global trade regulations have materially impacted and could continue to materially impact our business and operations. For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations that may materially impact us, please see the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.
Healthcare IT Industry
 The healthcare IT industry in which we operate is highly regulated, and the services we provide are subject to a complex set of healthcare laws and regulations, including, among others, the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (“MACRA”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), regulations issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”), a number of fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended, the “PPACA”), as discussed below. In addition, the healthcare IT industry is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other industry standards, which create both significant opportunities as well as certain challenges. These include:
 • Provider Reimbursement: In recent years, there have been significant changes to provider payment models by the United States federal government, moving toward a value-based care model similar to those being adopted by commercial payers and state governments. This leads to increasing pressure on healthcare organizations to reduce costs and increase the ability to demonstrate a high quality of care, replacing fee-for-service models in part by expanding advanced payment models. Such changes to provider payment models could further encourage the adoption of healthcare IT as a means of achieving those goals through increased efficiency, enhanced workflows, easier care coordination, and improved access to complete medical information.
 

oThe passage of MACRA in 2015 codified the creation of new payment models, such as ACOs and the Quality Payment Program (“QPP”), that have significantly expanded and will continue to significantly expand the number of ambulatory healthcare professionals delivering care under payment programs that are driven by quality measurement. In 2016, CMS issued preliminary regulations for the QPP, and many of our clients are also involved with the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus program, which is working toward similar goals by emphasizing the role of the primary care provider. Another driver of healthcare IT adoption in the primary care space is the Patient Centered Medical Home program, a voluntary program in which many of our clients participate that has a strong emphasis on quality measurement and patient engagement. Even where some of these programs will likely be adjusted in part by CMS and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation under the Biden Administration, significant levels of reimbursements will still require providers to capture, communicate, measure and share outcomes through technology solutions such as ours, given that those requirements are bound in federal statute.
 •PPACA: PPACA, which was signed into law in 2010, has impacted us and our clients. While at this time repeal of the law is unlikely, particularly under the Biden Administration, legal challenges continue to be raised within the justice system. Many components of the law, including those which have had a positive effect on our business by requiring the expanded use of health IT products, are expected to remain in effect regardless of legal challenges, as they are not subject to repeal or modification under any currently pending legislation. Certain provisions of PPACA, such as those mandating reductions in reimbursement for certain types of providers or decreasing the number of covered lives in the United States or the depth of insurance coverage available to patients, may have a negative effect on our sales by reducing the resources available to our current and prospective clients to purchase our products. 
 •Cures Act: In late 2016, Congress passed the Cures Act, a sweeping piece of legislation attempting to modernize many areas of the healthcare industry. Sections of the law addressing interoperability also codified the concept of information blocking, requiring a new regulatory structure to respond to concerns that actors in the healthcare industry intentionally block the exchange of information between various stakeholders. The Cures Act authorized penalties for any such action for health IT developers and health information exchange entities, as well as virtually every type of provider organization that Allscripts serves. We are responding to the requirements of the final associated regulation on Interoperability, Information Exchange and Certification released by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology ("ONC") in March 2020 as thoroughly as possible. The ONC regulation, which involves complex and specific requirements, requires that we evaluate changes to business processes related to requests for the access, exchange or use of Electronic Health Information, as well as development to meet new certification requirements. Our Company has been and remains committed to open and efficient information exchange and we will continue to support clients in their efforts to exchange health data and meet all new associated certification requirements.
 •HITECH: In 2009, the United States federal government enacted HITECH, which authorized the ONC to establish the functionality that EHR products must meet in order for our technologies to be considered certified. The incentive program available to healthcare providers who implemented EHRs and demonstrated meaningful use has since expired, but requirements associated with certification and privacy remain in effect. 
 •Privacy and Health Data: Allscripts is subject to numerous privacy and security laws and regulations, including HIPAA and the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”). 
 

oHIPAA: HIPAA and its implementing regulations contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individuals’ protected health information (“PHI”). As part of the operation of our business, Allscripts and our subcontractors may have access to, or our clients may provide to us, individually identifiable health information related to the treatment, payment and operations of providers’ practices. In the United States, government and industry legislation and rulemaking, especially HIPAA, HITECH and standards and requirements published by industry groups such as the Joint Commission, require the use of standard transactions, standard identifiers, security and other standards and requirements for the transmission of certain Electronic Health Information. HIPAA applies to “Covered Entities,” such as certain healthcare providers, health plans, and “healthcare clearinghouses,” as well as business associates that performed functions on behalf of or provided services to Covered Entities. We consider ourselves a Covered Entity due to our acting as a healthcare clearinghouse through our provision of Allscripts Payerpath due to its filing of electronic healthcare claims on behalf of healthcare providers that are subject to HIPAA and HITECH. In addition, as a result of our dealings with certain clients and others in the healthcare industry that may be considered Covered Entities under or otherwise subject to the requirements of HIPAA, we are, in some circumstances, considered a business associate under HIPAA. As a business associate, we are subject to the HIPAA requirements relating to the privacy and security of PHI. Among other things, HIPAA requires business associates to (i) maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards to prevent PHI from misuse, (ii) report security incidents and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information, including to individuals and governmental authorities, and (iii) assist Covered Entities from which we obtain health information with certain of their duties under HIPAA. We have policies and procedures that we believe comply with federal and state confidentiality requirements for the handling of PHI that we receive and with our obligations under Business Associate Agreements.
 The principal effects of HIPAA are, first, to require that our systems be capable of being operated by us and our clients in a manner that is compliant with the Transaction, Security and Privacy Standards mandated by HIPAA, and second, to comply with HIPAA when it directly applies to us. We have policies and safeguards in place intended to protect health information as required by HIPAA and have processes in place to assist us in complying with applicable laws and regulations regarding the protection of this data and responding to any security incidents. The Office of Civil Rights ("OCR") has proposed updates and changes to HIPAA-related regulations and is expected to take further action to do so in the coming year. Additionally, we anticipate that proposed federal legislation requiring specific notification of cyber incidents may also pass in 2022. Allscripts plans to adjust our processes and procedures as necessary, as new rules are finalized.
 oFTC Act: Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. The FTC Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, may be applicable to health information that is held in a capacity that does not implicate HIPAA. Therefore, for certain activities and applications, we employ processes designed to comply with the FTC Act. 
 o42 CFR Part 2: The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is expected to finalize a regulation changing requirements and restrictions specific to the storage and exchange of behavioral health- and substance use disorder-related patient data, and they have indicated they will be working with OCR to harmonize regulations governing requirements specific to different types of patient data. Allscripts is part of industry efforts working to ease integration between such sensitive health data and the patient’s larger health record. Similarly, we will adjust policies and procedures as required by any final regulation as released.
 •Fraud and Abuse Laws: The healthcare industry is subject to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse that, among other things, prohibit the direct or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for patient referrals, or for the purchase or order, or arranging for or recommending referrals or purchases, of any item or service paid for in whole or in part by these federal or state healthcare programs. Federal enforcement personnel have substantial funding, powers and remedies to pursue suspected or perceived fraud and abuse. Moreover, both federal and state laws forbid bribery and similar behavior.
 

oFederal Anti-Kickback Statute: The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase or order of any item, good, facility or services covered by these programs. Courts have interpreted the law to provide that a financial arrangement may violate this law if any one of the purposes of an arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. There are several limited exclusions known as safe harbors that may protect some arrangements from enforcement penalties. Penalties for federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations can be severe, and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil money penalties with triple damages (when the False Claims Act is implicated) and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. DHHS finalized changes to the latest regulations stemming from the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Stark Law in late 2020, continuing to make further allowances for exclusions associated with the purchase of health information technology.
 oFalse Claims Act: The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we do not submit claims directly to payors, Allscripts could be held liable under the False Claims Act if we are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers through our revenue cycle/claims management services, or if our EHR products are found to have caused providers to have inaccurately attested to incentive or reimbursement program criteria.
 We believe that these and other changes in laws and regulations, along with increasing pressure from private payers to move providers to quality-based payment programs and market opportunities to maximize the data that is increasingly being created and captured through the care process, will continue to drive adoption of healthcare IT products and services such as ours. We anticipate continued pressure through a variety of administrative and regulatory levers to increase interoperability in the industry across a variety of stakeholders, including implementing regulations that require robust, sophisticated health technology. For example, although many large physician groups have already purchased EHR technology, we expect those groups may choose to replace their older EHR technology to comply with ongoing QPP and ACO requirements and to add new features and functionality. Further, opportunities for healthcare provider organizations to expand their care coordination efforts in order to successfully comply with new payment programs, as outlined in the Cures Act, could lead to additional demand for our solutions.
 Global Trade
 As a global company, the import and export of our products and services are subject to laws and regulations including international treaties, U.S. export controls and sanctions laws, customs regulations, and local trade rules around the world. Such laws, rules and regulations may delay the introduction of some of our products or impact our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and individuals, or requiring compliance with disparate local laws concerning transfer and disclosure of health data and laws concerning controlled technology or source code. The consequences of any failure to comply with domestic and foreign trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business globally.
Business Organization
 We derive our revenues primarily from sales of our proprietary software (either as a direct license sale or under a subscription delivery model), which also serves as the basis for our recurring service contracts for software support and maintenance and certain transaction-related services. In addition, we provide various other client services, including installation, and managed services such as outsourcing, private cloud hosting and revenue cycle management.
 During 2021, we realigned our reporting structure as a result of certain organizational changes. Refer to Note 19, “Business Segments,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for detailed discussion about these changes. Our two reportable segments are as follows:
 •The Hospitals and Large Physician Practices reportable segment derives its revenue from the sale of integrated clinical and financial management solutions, which primarily include EHR-related software, related installation, support and maintenance, outsourcing and private cloud hosting. 
 •The Veradigm reportable segment derives its revenue from payer and life sciences solutions, which are mainly targeted at payers, life sciences companies and other key healthcare stakeholders. Additionally, revenue is derived from software applications for patient engagement and the sale of EHR software to single-specialty and small and mid-sized physician practices, including related clinical, financial, administrative and operational solutions. These solutions enable clients to transition, analyze and coordinate care and improve the quality, efficiency and value of healthcare delivery across the entire care community.
 

The results of operations related to the CarePort Health business (“CarePort”), which was sold on December 31, 2020, is presented throughout our financial statements as discontinued operations. Prior to the sale, CarePort was previously reported within the former Data, Analytics and Care Coordination reportable segment. Refer to Note 18, “Discontinued Operations” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.
 Clients
Our clients in the Hospitals and Large Physician Practices segment include some of the most prestigious medical groups and hospitals in the United States and internationally and often serve as reference sources for prospective clients interested in purchasing our solutions. Our clients in the Veradigm segment include coordinated community care organizations, health plans and payors, life sciences companies and small to mid-size physician practices. For each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had one client that accounted for 12% of our revenue. No other single client accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Research and Development
 Rapid innovation characterizes the healthcare IT industry. We believe our ability to compete successfully depends heavily on our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the markets in which we operate.
Because of this, we continue to invest into our research and development efforts with a focus on growth opportunities. These efforts include developing new solutions as well as new features and enhancements to our existing solutions, which we believe will ensure that our solutions comply with continually evolving regulatory requirements and create additional opportunities to connect our systems to the healthcare community.
Competition
 The markets for our solutions and services are highly competitive and are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and solution standards and user needs, as well as frequent introduction of new solutions and services. Some of our competitors may be more established, benefit from greater name recognition and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources.
 We compete with numerous types of organizations, including developers of revenue cycle and practice management software and services, large system integrators, IT service providers, ambulatory and acute care EHR solutions, population health management and value-based care technologies, analytics systems, care management solutions and post-acute solutions. We generally compete on the basis of several factors, including breadth and depth of services (including our open architecture and the level of solution integration across care settings), integrated platform, regulatory compliance, reputation, reliability, accuracy, security, client service, total cost of ownership, innovation and industry acceptance, expertise and experience. We believe we compete favorably on these metrics and are one of the leading companies offering a suite of healthcare IT solutions.
 Moreover, we expect competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the IT and healthcare industries. If one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.
 Our principal existing competitors in these markets include, but are not limited to (in alphabetical order) AdvancedMD, Advantmed, LLC, Aetion, Inc., Apixio, athenahealth, Inc., Availity, LLC, Cerner Corporation, Change Healthcare, Cotiviti, Inc., CPSI (Computer Programs and Systems Inc.), Datavant, DoseSpot, DrChrono, Inc., DrFirst, DRG Claims Management, LLC, eClinicalWorks, LLC, Enli Health Intelligence, Epic Systems Corporation, Episource, LLC, Evercommerce, Inc., Evolent Health, Inc., Greenway Health, LLC, Harris Healthcare, Healthagen, Health Catalyst, Inovalon, IQVIA, Kareo, Inc., MDToolbox, MEDHOST, Inc., Meditech (Medical Information Technology, Inc.), Medsphere Systems Corporation, Modernizing Medicine, Inc., NextGen Healthcare, Inc., nThrive Revenue Systems, LLC, OM1, Inc., Optum, Inc., Panalgo, LLC, Phreesia, Premier Inc., R1 RCM, Inc., RXNT, Symphony Health, The T System, Inc., TriNetX, LLC, TriZetto Provider Solutions, Truven Health Analytics, Verana Health and Waystar.
 Backlog
 We had a contract backlog of $3.8 billion and $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, a decrease of 7%. Contract backlog represents the value of bookings and support and maintenance contracts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Bookings reflect the value of executed contracts for software, hardware, other client services, private-cloud hosting, outsourcing and subscription-based services. Total contract backlog can fluctuate between periods based on the level of revenue and bookings as well as the timing and mix of renewal activity and periodic revalidations. We estimate that approximately 34% of our aggregate contract backlog as of December 31, 2021 will be recognized as revenue during 2022.
Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information.
Many of our products include intellectual property obtained from third parties. For example:
•Many of our products are built on technology provided by Microsoft Corporation, such as the Microsoft SQL Server information platform, the Microsoft .NET Framework and the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. 
 •We license content from companies such as OptumInsight, 3M Health Information Systems, Wolters Kluwer Health, Elsevier, IMO and Clinical Architecture, which we incorporate or use in certain solutions. 
 It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services. While we have generally been able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that we can obtain such licenses in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Because of continuous healthcare IT innovation, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of our solutions may unknowingly infringe upon an existing patent or other intellectual property rights of others. Occasionally, we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties. While the outcome of any litigation or dispute is uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution any of these infringement notices will have a material adverse impact on our business.
 Geographic Information
 Historically, the majority of our clients and revenue have been associated with North America, where we have clients in the United States and Canada. While we remain focused on the North American market, which we expect will continue to drive our revenue in the future, we believe that there are opportunities for us globally as other countries face similar challenges of controlling healthcare costs while improving the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. As a result, we have increased our efforts to selectively expand the sales of many of our solutions outside of North America, primarily in the United Kingdom, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.
Human Capital
 We track and report internally on key talent metrics, including workforce demographics, talent pipeline, diversity data and engagement of our employees. As of December 31, 2021, we had nearly 8,000 employees, including approximately 60% in the United States, 35% in India, 1.5% in Canada, 1% in Israel, and 2.5% in other international countries. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union.
Our employees are a significant asset and we recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining talent at all levels is vital to our continued success. We aim to create an inclusive, respectful and open work environment and culture comprised of talented employees of diverse backgrounds. Our employees can grow and advance their careers, with the overall goal of developing, expanding and retaining our workforce to support our business. We strive to sustain a work environment where each employee’s perspective, background, skills and abilities are valued for supporting our mission to create solutions that enable smarter care for healthier patients, populations and communities. We invest in our employees through high-quality benefits and various health and wellness initiatives and offer competitive compensation packages.
The health and safety of our employees are critical to our success. For Allscripts, many of our employees are client-facing and participate in the day-to-day operations of hospitals and medical centers. While continuing to follow our stringent protocols put in place at the beginning of the pandemic, in early August, we announced our mandatory vaccination policy for employees in the U.S. As other governments implement vaccine mandates, we add those countries to our policy. To date, approximately 75% of our global workforce has been fully vaccinated.
Fostering inclusivity and equity in our workforce is also vital to our success. Allscripts’ Executive and Operations Cabinets, comprised of our Chief Executive Officer’s direct staff, include seven men and four women. Globally, our population of employees at the level of Director and above is 66% male and 34% female. In addition to previously established enrichment groups such as Allscripts Women Engagement and GenNext, we have welcomed four more groups in 2021 — Allscripts Pride Alliance, Allscripts Black Alliance, Hispanic Outreach for Latinos at Allscripts and Military, Veterans and Allies.
 We have a nine-block leadership development process that helps us identify our high potential talent each year. This gives us a view of succession planning for promotions in the organization. Our strategy incorporates thoughtful review around ensuring we have a diversity lens in identifying high potential talent in the organization. With a focus on development, we filled 51% of our management openings internally in 2021.
 

We regularly solicit feedback through surveys and other mechanisms to gain insights into workplace engagement, what motivates employees to do their best work and overall employee satisfaction. Employees are provided opportunities to raise suggestions and collaborate with leadership to implement ongoing improvements. We use the results of the surveys to influence our people strategy and policies.
In 2021, our employee experience framework utilized several listening opportunities to hear and learn from employees. The three primary tools used are an annual company-wide Engagement survey, Lifecycle surveys (new hire and exit surveys) and Learning and Development surveys. Our Engagement survey emphasizes measuring confidence in leadership, perceived care for employees, consistency in how policies are applied, and effectiveness of communication efforts. Our Chief Executive Officer reviews overall Company results with employees and leaders at all levels and engages in actions to remove barriers to engagement. We conducted our last Engagement survey in April 2021 and have taken steps based on the results. Actions taken include the rollout of our All In To Win bonus, which provides every employee the opportunity to earn a bonus, Coffee Talks with our CEO, and a decision to conduct the Engagement survey annually.
