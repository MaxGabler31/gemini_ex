Overview of Our Company

Cross Country Healthcare, Inc. (NASDAQ: CCRN) is a national leader in providing healthcare staffing, recruiting and value-added workforce solutions. Through a full suite of innovative workforce solutions and a national presence including 76 office locations throughout the United States (U.S.), we are able to meet the unique and dynamic needs of our clients. By utilizing our various solutions, clients are able to better plan their personnel needs, outsource recruitment processes, strategically flex their workforce, streamline their purchasing needs, access specialties not available in their local area, access quality healthcare personnel and provide continuity of care for improved patient outcomes. 
Our solutions are geared towards assisting our clients in solving their labor issues while maintaining high quality outcomes. We are increasingly being called upon to provide more creative and strategic talent sourcing strategies, particularly to find efficiencies to support cost containment programs and to access hard to find specialties in the current tight labor market. Over the past several years, our Managed Service Programs (MSPs) have shifted to more of a total talent management relationship as our clients continue to focus on improving labor management to address complex financial, compliance, and other challenges in the healthcare industry. In the past 24 months, we have won 23 additional MSP contracts, and for the full year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 30% of our revenue was generated through MSP contracts. During 2017, we had more than 29,000 healthcare professionals on assignment at 6,975 facilities, and our MSPs served approximately 500 facilities. 
Our workforce solutions include:
l    Managed Service Programs (MSPs);
l    Optimal Workforce Solutions (OWS);
l    Education Healthcare Services; 
l    Electronic Medical Record Transition Staffing (EMR);
l    Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO); and
l    Internal Resource Pool Consulting & Development (IRP).

We are able to provide our services on a national level or through any one of our 69 local branches throughout the United States or through a combination of both. We service a variety of clients, including public and private acute care hospitals, public and charter schools, outpatient clinics, ambulatory care facilities, single and multi-specialty physician practices, rehabilitation facilities, urgent care centers, correctional facilities, government facilities, retailers, and many other healthcare providers. Our business consists of three business segments: (i) Nurse and Allied Staffing, (ii) Physician Staffing, and (iii) Other Human Capital Management Services. Fees for our services are paid directly by our clients and in certain instances by vendor managers, and as a result, we have no direct exposure to Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements.

Our consolidated 2017 revenue was $865.0 million, reflecting a diversified revenue mix across healthcare customers. Nurse and Allied Staffing was 88% of revenue, comprised of travel nurse, travel allied, and branch-based local nurse and allied staffing (including staffing of public and charter schools). Physician Staffing was 10% of our revenue and consists primarily of physician staffing services with placements across multiple specialties. Other Human Capital Management Services was 2% of our revenue, which consists of our retained and contingent search services primarily for physicians and healthcare executives. On a company-wide basis, we have approximately 6,600 active contracts with healthcare clients, and we provide our staffing services and workforce solutions in all 50 states. In 2017, 2016, and 2015 no client accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. For additional financial information concerning our business segments, see Note 17 - Segment Data to the consolidated financial statements.
Acquisitions
We follow a structured disciplined approach with clearly identified objectives to make strategic acquisitions. Historically, we have acquired companies to improve our position in the four sectors of healthcare where we participate. Accordingly, we acquired traditional healthcare staffing companies such as travel nurse, travel allied, and per diem staffing. The strategic rationale for making acquisitions in Nurse and Allied Staffing has been to: (i) expand our workforce solutions offerings to deepen our relationships with current customers and to attract new customers; (ii) expand our local branch network to grow our local market presence and our MSP business; (iii) further diversify our customer base into the public and charter school market; (iii) diversify our customer base into the local ambulatory care and retail market, which provides more balance between our large volume-based customers and our small local customers; (iv) better position ourselves to take additional market share in our MSP business; (v) access more candidates and candidates in different specialties; and (vi) add new skill sets to our traditional staffing offerings. 
In 2015 we expanded our acquisition strategy and acquired Mediscan, an education healthcare staffing company. Staffing of speech language pathologists, physical therapists, and other healthcare workers in schools (public and private) is: (i) mandated by the government; and (ii) not as sensitive to changes in the economy. We believe the higher margin education healthcare staffing market complements our current business and provides an opportunity to add new service lines and further diversify our customer base, as the Mediscan business is divided between acute/ambulatory care and public and charter schools.
In July 2017, we were presented with an opportunity to acquire a quality nurse staffing company, Advantage RN, LLC (Advantage). We acquired the Advantage business to supplement the number of nurses we place at our MSP clients, increase our capture rate, and reduce the number of positions outsourced to subcontractors. In addition, this acquisition provides a vehicle for us to cross-sell our MSP solutions to Advantage's clients, and increase our footprint in the Midwest where Advantage is located. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Advantage had an average of 750 nurses on assignment throughout the United States. 
In December 2016, we acquired an RPO business, US Resources Healthcare. The rationale for this acquisition was to increase our workforce solutions capabilities to deliver financial and operating efficiencies to our customers through labor optimization services while enhancing the quality of care. By partnering with our customers to design and execute a tailored solution to meet their talent and business goals, we are able to find the talent our customers need. For additional financial information concerning our acquisitions, see Note 3 - Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements.
Competition 

The principal competitive factors in attracting, retaining, and expanding business with healthcare clients nationally include: (i) understanding the client’s work environment; (ii) offering a comprehensive suite of services to assist the client in assessing its personnel needs and partnering with clients to design various customizable alternative solutions; (iii) the timely filling of clients' needs; (iv) price; (v) customer service; (vi) quality assurance and screening capabilities; (vii) risk management policies; (viii) insurance coverage; and (ix) general industry reputation. The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified healthcare professionals for temporary employment include: (i) a large national pool of desirable assignments; (ii) pay and benefits; (iii) speed of placements; (iv) customer service; (v) quality of accommodations; and (vi) overall industry reputation. We focus on retaining healthcare professionals by providing high-quality customer service, long-term benefits (to employees), and medical malpractice insurance.
We believe we are one of only two large full-service healthcare staffing providers with a national footprint; one of the top five providers of physician staffing services in the United States; and one of the top providers of retained and contingent physician and healthcare executive search services in the healthcare marketplace. Some of our competitors in the healthcare staffing, workforce solutions, and search businesses include: AMN Healthcare Services, Inc., CHG Healthcare Services, Maxim Healthcare, Jackson Healthcare, Team Health, HealthTrust Workforce Solutions, MedAssets, and Witt Kiefer.
We believe we benefit competitively from the following:

Breadth and Expertise of Value-Added Workforce Solutions Offered. As a long-time leader of MSP solutions, our additional services include: OWS, Education Healthcare Staffing Services, EMR staffing, RPO, and IRP. Our holistic approach is to deploy cost effective labor optimization strategies uniquely designed for each customer, all while ensuring quality of care for patients.

- | MSP Capabilities. Rather than an acute care facility’s talent management team working with multiple staffing agencies, our MSP model offers a consultative approach to address total talent management, a single point of contact, access to a nationwide network of subcontractors, uniform rates and terms, and accountability for the quality of healthcare professionals to our clients through the aggregation and standardization of total contract labor spend. This MSP model has become a desired practice of healthcare systems seeking to drive financial and operating efficiencies, while ensuring quality of care.


- | OWS. These services allow our clients to outsource certain non-core department staff that may be particularly challenging to recruit and retain. By outsourcing these departments to our OWS team, our clients can better control their operating costs, gain access to our talent management expertise, free their internal resources for other purposes, streamline or increase efficiency for certain functions, and improve their overall focus.


- | Education Healthcare Staffing Services. By providing consultative and staffing services to traditional public and charter school clients, we help them achieve performance and cost savings goals while experiencing greater flexibility in their operations.


- | EMR. Based on the government mandate for hospitals to convert to Electronic Medical Records to ensure payment for services, we developed a sound transition and implementation process to help our clients backfill staffing needs while they adopt a new or upgraded EMR platform. Staffing plans are created in collaboration with our clients so they have adequate, planned, quality staffing to cover these peak vacancies.


- | RPO. We offer business process outsourcing where a client transfers all or part of its talent management recruitment processes to us and we can assume the design and management of the recruitment process and the responsibility for the results. The structure of this solution differs greatly from client to client as there is a continuum of scope of the services that may be provided (e.g. end to end services or hybrid solutions).


- | IRP. We consult with our clients to structure groups of their staff professionals that can be called upon when shortages exist or are expected. These professionals agree to fill positions when necessary and are available when called upon. They have experience with the facilities where they will work, so they are immediately up to speed with how things are done and what is expected from them the moment they arrive. This type of pool promotes quality of care and is cost-efficient for our clients. 

Ability to Meet a National Shift Towards a More Integrated Delivery of Healthcare. With our national resources, as well as local resources at our 69 local branches, we are uniquely positioned to assist hospitals and health systems which continue to turn to lower-cost, more accessible alternatives, such as outpatient or ambulatory care centers as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 and other market dynamics. By offering travel, per diem, and permanent placement of a variety of healthcare professionals, we are also able to offer many different types of personnel to hospitals and health systems at their main campuses, as well as their ambulatory and outpatient care centers, in order to meet their workforce needs.
Brand Recognition. We go to market with a variety of brands, which are well-recognized among leading hospitals and healthcare facilities and many healthcare professionals. These businesses have been operating for more than twenty years.
Strong and Diverse Client Relationships. We provide healthcare staffing and workforce solutions to a diverse client base throughout the United States with approximately 6,600 active contracts with hospitals and healthcare facilities, and other healthcare providers. As a result, we have a diverse choice of assignments for our healthcare professionals to choose from. In addition, our joint venture with a large health system's staffing subsidiary provides us with a unique insight into the challenges facing many of our hospital clients generally and this provides us with the opportunity to better serve all of our clients by designing and implementing workforce solutions to meet their needs. Our relationship with the largest member- owned healthcare services company in the United States should also serve to expand our relationships in the healthcare community.
Recruiting and Placement of Healthcare Professionals. Healthcare professionals apply with us through our differentiated nursing, locum tenens, and allied healthcare recruitment brands. Our local branch network provides us access to local healthcare professionals who are uniquely qualified to provide care in ambulatory and outpatient settings. We believe our access to such a large and diverse group of healthcare professionals makes us more attractive to healthcare institutions and facilities seeking healthcare staffing and workforce solutions in the current dynamic marketplace.
Certifications. The staffing businesses of our Cross Country Staffing, Medical Staffing Network (MSN), and Mediscan brands are certified by The Joint Commission under its Health Care Staffing Services Certification Program. In addition, 
3

Credent Verification and Licensing Services, a subsidiary of Medical Doctor Associates (MDA), is certified by the National Committee of Quality Assurance (NCQA) -- one of only a handful of companies to achieve such certification.
Experienced Management Team. On average, our executive management team has more than 20 years of staffing experience. Led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, a 30-year staffing industry veteran who joined the Company in April 2013, the Company has strengthened its leadership team by bringing in experienced executives.
Demand and Supply Drivers
Demand Drivers
Effect of ACA on Healthcare Utilization. The ACA has increased the number of insured patients over the past few years, especially in states that have expanded Medicaid. It has been reported that the effect of the ACA on healthcare utilization has been that 20 million people have gained health insurance coverage, whether through the federal marketplace, Medicaid expansion, or individuals staying on their parents' health insurance plans (Obamacarefacts.com, January 2018). Despite the shortened enrollment period for 2018, an estimated 8,800,000 individuals have reportedly signed up for 2018 coverage via the federal health insurance exchange and 2017 enrollees were auto renewed in December 2017 for 2018 (Centers for Medicaid & Medicaid Services, Weekly Enrollment Snapshot, December, 2017). In addition, while the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 Public Law No. 115-97 (2017 Tax Act) did away with the individual mandate, the elimination of that penalty does not go into effect until the beginning of 2019 and we expect many individuals to maintain insurance under their parents’ policies or otherwise. We believe the demand for healthcare professionals will continue as the number of insured has increased in the past few years under the ACA and with more persons employed who have healthcare insurance.
Creation of Healthcare Jobs Outpacing Other Industries and Occupations. Healthcare represented 15% of all jobs created in 2017 (HealthleadersMedia.com, January 5, 2018). The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently released its latest 10-year projections of employment growth (from 2016 to 2026), with forecasts by various industries and occupations. Overall, employment is expected to grow 7.4%, far outpaced by employment in the healthcare industry (18%) and among healthcare occupations (18%) (Staffing Industry Analysts, December 14, 2017). This projected 18% growth varies, however, among three categories that make up the healthcare industry: (i) ambulatory healthcare services; (ii) nursing and residential care; and (iii) hospitals. Employment for ambulatory healthcare services is projected to grow 31%; nursing and residential care is projected to grow 13%, and hospital employment is projected to grow 6.8%. The creation of additional jobs in the healthcare market should increase demand for our services as our temporary staff are typically hired to replace healthcare workers taking vacation and leaves of absence.
Use of Temporary Workforce. The December 2017 penetration rate of temporary workers was 2.1% (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2017 Labor Force Statistics Database). We believe contingent labor will continue to be used strategically, as an increase in the use of temporary workers typically allows for cost-effective, time-sensitive solutions to specific business needs and allows organizations to leverage the skills of temporary workers while maintaining a lean staff of traditional permanent employees. Within the healthcare sector, we believe the current dynamic nature of the healthcare industry, among other things, has exacerbated hospitals’ needs for more flexibility to match revenue and payroll. 
Hospitals Seeking Efficiencies to Reduce Costs. Hospitals continue to face pressure to keep costs down to protect their margins from continued Medicare rate reductions and fluctuations in demand for hospital care. This will be further exacerbated if Congress targets entitlement programs to reduce spending on both federal healthcare and anti-poverty programs to reduce the U.S. deficit. In addition, the national shift away from volume-based pricing to value-based pricing continues. The visibility of Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey scores, a national, standardized, publicly reported survey of patients' perspectives of hospital care, has also put pressure on hospitals to maintain a certain level of quality of care so hospitals do not incur financial penalties or risk decreased patient volume due to low scores. We believe these dynamics continue to put pressure on hospitals to find innovative solutions in order to better manage their workforce, which accounts for a large portion of their expenses. Working with an MSP allows healthcare facilities to easily flex their workforce numbers up and down and to streamline their talent acquisition process by having one point-of-contact (Modern Healthcare, March 16, 2017). As a result, we believe hospitals are more willing to engage healthcare staffing companies, such as ours, that provide both staffing and workforce solutions that can help them solve problems, such as assessing their workforce needs or reducing readmission rates without negatively impacting the quality of care. Many hospitals are also making vertical acquisitions by investing in outpatient facilities, ambulatory care centers, and stand-alone emergency departments in order to capture outpatient revenue, which will further drive demand for healthcare personnel.

Outpatient/Ambulatory Settings Services Outpace Inpatient Services. Job growth in ambulatory services such as physician's offices and dental clinics continues to outpace that of the hospital sector as the demand for outpatient services grows (HealthleadersMedia.com, May 8, 2017). The ambulatory sector added 14,800 jobs in December 2017, while hospitals added 12,400 jobs in the same period (Modern Healthcare, January 2018). We believe certain initiatives previously taken under the ACA - such as Medicare reimbursement incentives for reduced readmissions, have had a direct correlation to the shift from inpatient services to outpatient/ambulatory settings. We believe we are poised to take advantage of this trend given our 69 local branches that deliver services in local settings. 
Growing and Aging U.S. Population. Two long-term macro drivers of our business are demographic in nature -- a growing and aging U.S. population. The U.S. Census Bureau projects the U.S. population will increase approximately 31% (from 319 million in 2014 to 417 million in 2060) - crossing the 400 million mark in 2051. In addition, by 2030 one in five Americans is also projected to be 65 years old or more. The number of persons aged 65 and over is expected to increase to 98 million in 2060 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015). Currently, there are 75 million baby boomers (Modern Healthcare, Nursing Shortage in Perspective, January 1, 2018), which is important because the utilization of healthcare services is generally higher among older people. The American Hospital Association (AHA) has also projected the share of hospital admissions for the over-65 age group to rise from 38% in 2004 to 56% in 2030. Currently, 80% of the baby boomer population has at least one chronic condition (Modern Healthcare, Nursing Shortage in Perspective, January 1, 2018). With the increase in the proportion of the population in older age groups reaching prime retirement age, healthcare occupations and industries are expected to have the fastest employment growth and to add the most jobs, increasing their employment share by four million people to 13.8% in 2026 (Healthcare Financial Management Association, October 30, 2017). Employment in the healthcare and social assistance sector is projected to add nearly 4 million jobs by 2026, about one-third of all new jobs (Modern Healthcare, Nursing Shortage in Perspective, January 1, 2018). 
Nursing Shortage. The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce (CEW) predicts a shortage of 192,620 nurses in 2020, which differs from the surplus of nurses predicted for 2025 by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) National Center for Health Workforce Analysis (Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce (CEW), Forecasts of Nursing Demand 2015). With healthcare now representing almost 20% of the U.S. economy, the aging of the U.S. population, and the expansion of healthcare coverage under the ACA, both the CEW and HRSA agree that demand for healthcare services and healthcare workers will continue to grow. The CEW’s analysis of the nursing shortage differs from that of the HRSA in that the CEW has made assumptions on the “active supply” of nurses - noting there is a stark difference between the number of nursing professionals who are licensed and the number of nursing professionals in the workforce. In 2013, there were 5.2 million licensed nursing professionals, but only 3.6 million were employed in the nursing workforce - so one-third of licensed nurses do not work in nursing (Georgetown University CEW, Forecasts of Nursing Demand 2015). As further noted by CEW, “as the economy improves, many more nurses will have the option to leave the nursing workforce for other types of jobs or to retire.” By 2030, almost a million nurses will retire and leave the workforce taking with them the years of knowledge and experience they have accumulated (Modern Healthcare, Nursing Shortage In Perspective, January 1, 2018). In addition, even HRSA’s analysis notes that its national projection does not take into account an imbalance of RNs at the state level where many states are projected to experience a smaller growth in RN supply relative to their state-specific demand, resulting in a geographical shortage of RNs by 2025. If current trends hold, seven states will have a nursing shortage in 2030: Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Texas (Modern Healthcare, Nursing Shortage In Perspective, January 1, 2018). Four of those states will have shortages of 10,000 or more nurses: California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Texas (Modern Healthcare, Nursing Shortage In Perspective, January 1, 2018). HRSA’s national projection also does not take into account a projected shortfall of registered nurses in particular specialties over the next ten years (Georgetown University CEW, Forecasts of Nursing Demand 2015). We believe the following factors will continue to contribute to new growth in demand for nurses: the continued aging of the baby boomers, the changing landscape of the healthcare industry with emerging care delivery models focused on quality of care, managing health status and preventing acute health issues (e.g., nurses taking on new and/or expanded roles in preventive care and care coordination), an uncertain level of newly insured individuals in the healthcare market, the number of nurses approaching retirement, and the number of registered nurses that re-entered the workforce during the economic downturn that are now likely to leave their jobs during a better economy.
More People Working Who Are Now Insured. The U.S. economy had a strong year in 2017, and the job market showed continued signs of growth with unemployment at 4.1% through December 2017 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2017 Labor Force Statistics Database). Individuals with employer-sponsored health insurance are more likely to seek medical care than the uninsured, which raises demand for healthcare services and healthcare staff (U.S. Healthcare Staffing Growth Assessment, Staffing Industry Analysts, December 2016). We believe the broader trends that created these labor market changes in 2017 will continue through 2018. Changes to tax rates should also boost the economy making jobs more attractive, thus continuing the consistent low unemployment trends from 2017. Temporary 
5

staffing added jobs every month during 2017 and the December 2017 temporary penetration rate for the U.S. continued at a record high 2.10 percent (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2017 Labor Force Statistics Database). The acceleration of the U.S. economy in 2017 has led to solid job growth, which we expect will result in more individuals receiving healthcare from their employers - thus supporting the demand for healthcare services.
Increased Need for Healthcare and Special Education Services in Schools. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), enacted in 1975, mandates that children and youth ages 3-21 with disabilities be provided a free and appropriate public school education. According to the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistic Report titled “The Condition of Education" (May 2017), the number of children and youth ages 3-21 receiving special education services was 6.7 million, or about 14% of traditional public and charter school enrollment. Of those students in school year 2014-15, 20% had a speech or language impairment, 13% had other health impairments, 9% had autism, 5% had emotional disturbances, 2% had multiple disabilities, and 1% had orthopedic impairments. The IDEA requires that these children and young adults receive care from speech language pathologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurses and other healthcare professionals while at school. Based on the foregoing, we believe the demand for consulting and healthcare staffing services for public schools and charter schools will continue to be strong for agencies that can provide consulting services, healthcare personnel, technical assistance on policies, implementation, and training related to children and youth with special needs in school settings.
Physician Shortage. The United States is expected to face a shortage of physicians over the next decade, according to a physician workforce report released by the Association of American Medical Colleges on April 5, 2016. The projections show a shortage ranging between 61,700 and 94,700 in 2025 as demand for physicians continues to outpace supply, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, with a significant shortage showing among many surgical specialties. This demand is largely due to the projected aging of the population and the ACA. Nationally, almost one-third of active physicians are age 60 or older (2017 State Physician Workforce Data Report, Association of American Medical Colleges). In addition, approximately 25% of active physicians in the United States are international medical graduates (2017 State Physician Workforce Data Report, Association of American Medical Colleges). The U.S. is expected to face a shortage of up to 20,500 primary care physicians by 2020 -- a number that is expected to grow to up to 31,100 by 2025, according to analysis by the AAMC (March 2015). The projected shortfall of non-primary care physicians is expected to be up to 63,700 by 2025. The AAMC also expects nearly one-third of all physicians will retire in the next decade. And, while the number of applicants to U.S. medical schools is increasing, it is not expected to keep pace with expected future demand.
Supply Drivers
Networking. We rely heavily on word-of-mouth referrals for our healthcare professionals. Historically, more than half of our field employees have been referred to us by other healthcare professionals. Our most effective “sales force” is our network of healthcare professionals who have taken temporary or permanent assignments with us or who are currently working for us. We continue to make investments in our online social and professional networks that have also made it easier for us to connect with healthcare professionals and stay connected with them, thus enhancing our recruitment efforts.
Traditional Reasons. Nurses, allied professionals, and locum tenens physicians work on temporary assignments to experience different geographic regions of the United States without moving permanently, work flexible schedules, gain professional development by working at prestigious healthcare facilities, earn top money and bonuses, travel with friends and family while enjoying quality accommodations, experience various clinical settings, look for a permanent position, and avoid workplace politics often associated with permanent staff positions.
Nurse Retirements. 70,000 nurses are retiring annually and, by 2030, almost a million nurses will retire and leave the workforce taking with them the years of knowledge and experience they have accumulated (Modern Healthcare, Nursing Shortage In Perspective, January 1, 2018). The 2017 Survey of Registered Nurses, Viewpoints on Leadership, Nursing Shortages, and their Profession conducted by AMN Healthcare found that 36% of nurses surveyed said they are planning to retire in one year or less, and 46% of nurses in 2017 who are planning to retire said they will do it in four years or more. 73% of baby boomer nurses who are planning to retire say they will do so in three years or less (2017 Survey of Registered Nurses, AMN Healthcare). These findings support the proposition that significant nurse retirements are already underway (2017 Survey of Registered Nurses, AMN Healthcare).
Higher Quit Rates with an Improved Economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses the quit rate as a measure of workers’ willingness or ability to leave jobs. According to the February 6, 2018 Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey Database, quits rose from 1.3% in December 2009 to 2.2% in December 2015 and was 2.2% through December 2017 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, Job Openings and Labor Turnover - December 2017). This increased quit 
6

rate from reflected increased confidence among the workforce. The number of job openings reported at the end of December 2017 also remained steady at 5,800,000 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, December 2017). With an improved economy and the low national unemployment rate, nurses do not appear as hesitant to quit or voluntarily leave their jobs. We believe with the increased volume of orders for temporary healthcare workers and as wages increase, staff nurses are more confident to change jobs and/or enter the temporary workforce. This is further supported by the 2017 Survey of Registered Nurses conducted by AMN Healthcare that found fewer nurses are planning to remain in their current positions, and some nurses currently working at the bedside plan to work outside of a direct patient care role or will work per diem for more flexibility and/or fewer hours (2017 Survey of Registered Nurses, AMN Healthcare).
National Licensure Compact Promoting Mobility for RNs. The Enhanced Nurse Licensure Compact (eNLC), overseen by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, was implemented on January 19, 2018. Under the eNLC, registered nurses and licensed practical/vocational nurses in member states can provide care to patients in other states without having to obtain additional licenses. It takes advantage of new technology and national databases to ensure that compact-licensed nurses meet consistent standards and background check benchmarks. The compact creates an expedited licensing process that gives nurses these privileges as long as they meet eleven uniform licensing as long as they meet eleven uniform licensing requirements. The eNLC will: (i) allow nurses to quickly cross state borders to provide vital services in the event of a disaster; (ii) make practicing across state borders more affordable and convenient by reducing the need for nurses and/or agencies who employ them to obtain additional nursing licenses; and (iii) allow licensed nurses in 25 states to use telehealth to treat patients in other states (National Council of State Boards of Nursing, Fact Sheet).
Temporary Physician Assignments. Locum tenens assignments offer physicians the ability to focus on practicing medicine while avoiding the stress of running their own practices; the ability to avoid paying the high costs of malpractice insurance; the opportunity to pick up extra shifts and weekends and work during the vacation time of full-time staff jobs in order to earn extra money and repay student loans; to lead a more flexible lifestyle; and to maintain their autonomy while practicing medicine. The supply of physicians available for our Physician Staffing services is variable and is influenced by several factors: the desire of physicians to work temporary assignments, the desire of physicians close to retirement to work fewer hours, work-life balance for all physicians, and the trend toward more female physicians in the workforce who traditionally work fewer hours than their male counterparts. 
Physicians Seeking Stability as Full-Time Staff. Over the past several years, physicians have increasingly become employees of hospitals or health systems due to business pressures and costs of operating private practices. Physician practices faced a combination of factors that include: stagnant or declining reimbursement rates, increased regulatory burden (including the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015), rising costs, greater risk associated with operating a private practice, and an increased desire for a better work-life balance. We believe physicians have sought employment with hospitals at higher rates over the past few years due to: traversing the maze of insurance company requirements, financial strains on private practices from repeated threatened pay cuts based on Medicare’s sustainable growth rate formulas, and the uncertain future of healthcare associated with the ACA. Joining a hospital's staff provides financial certainty and the ability to focus more on practicing medicine. We believe the increase in physicians employed by healthcare facilities will continue to increase supply for our physician and executive search business as physicians look for permanent employment with hospitals or health systems.
Our Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to increase our workforce solutions business and our capture rate at those accounts, grow our supply of healthcare professionals, improve our operating leverage through growth and cost containment, and make strategic disciplined acquisitions to strengthen and broaden our market presence:
Increasing our workforce solutions business by delivering value-added solutions and strengthening and expanding current client relationships and developing new relationships with hospitals and healthcare facilities. While the shift to value-based payments could slow or reverse, we believe that some iteration of the value-based payment models will remain in effect continuing to put financial pressure on our clients. To assist clients in meeting their financial and healthcare quality goals in a more complex environment, we design and execute workforce solutions customized to meet their unique needs. Our full suite of service offerings includes: MSP, OWS, IRP, Educational Healthcare Services, and RPO. Each of our businesses enjoy strong customer relationships that may serve as a platform to sell new MSP services or expand our workforce solutions at current clients. As a result, we continue to invest in sales and marketing to increase market share through cross-collaboration of our businesses.

Improving our capture rate at current MSP accounts and expanding our national and local market presence to support the shift to outpatient and ambulatory care centers. We believe our large national footprint will allow us to: (i) increase our market share at our current MSPs by improving our capture rate of per diem, local and allied healthcare staffing professionals; (ii) sell our MSP services to clients of our local branch-based network; (iii) support our current hospital and health system clients who are shifting care from inpatient to outpatient where possible and responding to market changes by making vertical acquisitions to control quality across the care continuum; (iv) support smaller, local customers; (v) support retail or commercial providers, such as national drugstore chains; (vi) broaden our customer base; and (vii) gain access to additional healthcare professionals who are uniquely qualified to provide care in outpatient and ambulatory care centers.
Growing our supply of healthcare professionals. We are investing in technology initiatives to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our interactions with our healthcare professionals. We also continue to invest in mobile and online technologies to increase our ability to attract and retain healthcare professionals. We believe providing communication options to our healthcare professionals will strengthen our relationships with them to improve supply and further enhance our delivery of high quality care for patients.
Expanding our gross profit margin and delivering a higher Adjusted EBITDA margin. We believe this can be accomplished by: (i) continuing to obtain pricing increases from our customers; (ii) managing our mix of business with hospitals and local/retail customers; (iii) expanding our workforce solutions business; and (iv) making further investments in our higher margin businesses: retained, contingent and permanent search, local allied, Healthcare Education Consulting, and RPO businesses.
Making strategic and disciplined acquisitions to strengthen and broaden our market presence. We believe the best acquisitions follow a structured and disciplined approach with clear strategic objectives, detailed implementation plans, and a focus on creating and capturing value for our shareholders. Our management team has broad and varied experience in multiple types of transactions.

Marketing and Recruiting Healthcare Professionals
We operate differentiated brands to recruit nurses and allied professionals. We believe our multi-brand recruiting model helps us reach a larger volume and a more diverse group of candidates to fill open positions at our clients throughout the United States in various clinical and non-clinical settings and in many different geographic areas. We believe nurses and allied professionals are attracted to us because we offer a wide range of diverse assignments in attractive locations, competitive compensation and benefit packages, scheduling options, as well as a high level of service to them. In addition, we believe nurses and allied professionals are confident we will have new assignments for them as they complete their current assignment. Our benefits generally include professional liability insurance, a 401(k) plan, health insurance, reimbursed travel, per diem allowances, and housing. Each of our nurse and allied healthcare professionals is employed by us is typically paid hourly wages and any other benefits they are entitled to receive during the assignment period.
Recruiters are an essential element of our Nurse and Allied Staffing business, and are responsible for establishing and maintaining key relationships with candidates for the duration of their assignments with us. Recruiters match the supply of qualified candidates in our databases with the demand for open orders posted by our clients. While we rely on word-of-mouth for referrals, we also market our brands on the Internet, including extensive utilization of social media, which has become an increasingly important component of our recruitment efforts. We maintain a number of websites to allow potential applicants to obtain information about our brands and assignment opportunities, as well as to apply online.
MDA recruits and contracts with physicians and advanced practice professionals to provide medical services for MDA’s healthcare customers. Each physician or advanced practice professional is an independent contractor and enters into an agreement with MDA to provide medical services at a particular healthcare facility or physician practice group based on terms and conditions specified by that customer. Physicians and advanced practice professionals are engaged to provide medical services for a healthcare customer ranging from a few days up to a year. We believe physicians are attracted to us because we offer a wide variety of assignments, competitive fees, medical malpractice insurance, and a high level of service to them. MDA relies on word-of-mouth referrals, but also markets it brands on the Internet and through extensive social media campaigns.

Cejka markets its retained and contingent search services to healthcare clients primarily through industry professional organizations, direct marketing, Cejka’s website, and word-of-mouth.
Credentialing and Quality Management
We screen all of our candidates prior to placement through our credentialing departments. While screening requirements are typically negotiated with our clients, each of our businesses has adopted its own minimum standard screening requirements. We continue to monitor our nursing and allied professional employees after placement in an effort to ensure quality performance, to determine eligibility for future placements, and to manage our malpractice risk profile. Our credentialing processes are designed to ensure that our professionals have the requisite skill set required by our customers, as well as the aptitude to meet the day-to-day requirements and challenges they would typically encounter on assignments where they are placed. The credentialing of our nurse and allied healthcare professionals is designed to align with the guidelines of The Joint Commission, a national accrediting body, to ensure quality care. Our Cross Country University division, accredited by the American Nurse Credentialing Center, provides training, assessment, and professional development to further ensure the quality of the personnel we place on assignment. Our physician credentialing entity, Credent, is also certified by the NCQA. We ask each of our healthcare clients to evaluate our healthcare employees who work at their facility at the end of each assignment in order to continually assess client satisfaction, and so that we may assist our employees with further educational development, if and where necessary.
Payment for Services
We negotiate payment for services with our clients based on market conditions and needs. We generally bill our nurse and allied employees at an hourly rate and assume all employer costs, including payroll, withholding taxes, benefits, professional liability insurance, and other requirements, as well as any travel and housing arrangements, where applicable. Our shared service center processes hours worked by field employees in the time and attendance systems, which in turn generate the billable transactions to our clients.
Hours worked by independent contractor physicians are reported to our MDA office. We bill our clients for hours worked by independent contractor physicians and for our recruitment fee. We negotiate payment for services with our clients based on market conditions and needs, and the amount we earn is not fixed. We keep a recruitment fee and pass on an agreed amount to the independent contractor physician on behalf of our clients.
For our physician and executive search business, Cejka typically bills its clients a candidate acquisition fee and is reimbursed for certain marketing expenses. 
Operations
Our Nurse and Allied and Physician Staffing businesses are operated through a relatively centralized business model servicing all assignment needs of our healthcare professional employees, physicians, and client healthcare facilities through operation centers located in Boca Raton, Florida; Newtown Square, Pennsylvania; West Chester, Ohio; Woodland Hills, California; and Berkeley Lake, Georgia. In addition to the key sales and recruitment activities, certain of these centers also perform support activities such as coordinating housing, payroll processing, benefits administration, billing and collections, travel reimbursement processing, customer service, and risk management. On December 31, 2017, we had 76 office locations.
Cejka Search primarily operates its business from its headquarters located in Creve Coeur, Missouri. This business operates relatively independently, other than certain ancillary services that are provided from our Boca Raton, Florida headquarters, such as payroll, legal, and information systems support.
Information Systems
Various information systems are utilized to run our customer relationship management, recruitment, and placement functions based on the different brands that we operate. Some of these sophisticated applications are proprietary and are hosted in Tier 1 
10

hosting facilities while other systems are Software as a Service (SaaS) based and hosted by our vendor partners. All of these systems were built/bought to handle considerable growth of all of our businesses. With capability to provide support to all of our facility clients, field employees, and independent contractors, our systems maintain detailed information about our client skill sets and status which assist us in enabling fulfillment and assignment renewal. Our databases are also an extensive pool of existing and potential customers and all related recruitment and sales activity. We constantly evaluate our systems, and the legacy systems for MDA and Cejka Search were recently replaced by an industry leading SaaS product.
Our financial and human resource systems are managed on leading enterprise resource planning software suites that manage certain aspects of accounts payable, accounts receivable, general ledger, billing, and human capital management. These systems have the ability to scale to accommodate revenue growth and/or employee growth. All of our systems are managed by our onshore and offshore Information Technology team.
Risk Management, Insurance, and Benefits
We have developed a risk management program that requires prompt notification of incidents by clients, clinicians, and independent contractors, educational training to our employees, loss analysis, and prompt reporting procedures to reduce our risk exposure. Each of our temporary employees receives instructions regarding the timely reporting of claims and this information is also available on our website. While we cannot predict the future, we continuously review facts and incidents associated with professional liability and workers’ compensation claims in order to identify trends and reduce our risk of loss in the future where possible. In addition, upon notification of an incident that may result in liability to us, we promptly gather all available documentation and review the actions of our employee and independent contractor to determine if he or she should remain on an assignment and whether he or she is eligible for another assignment with us. We consider assessments provided by our clients and we work with clinicians and experts from our insurance carriers to determine employment eligibility and potential exposure. Prior to approving an employee or independent contractor for an assignment, we review records from applicable state professional associations, the national practitioners’ database, and other such databases available to us.
We provide workers’ compensation insurance coverage, professional liability coverage, and healthcare benefits for our eligible temporary professionals. We record our estimate of the ultimate cost of, and reserves for, workers' compensation and professional liability benefits based on actuarial models prepared or reviewed by an independent actuary using our loss history as well as industry statistics. In determining our reserves, we include reserves for estimated claims incurred but not reported. We also estimate on a quarterly basis the healthcare claims that have occurred but have not been reported based on our historical claim submission patterns. The ultimate cost of workers’ compensation, professional liability, and health insurance claims will depend on actual amounts incurred to settle those claims and may differ from the amounts reserved for such claims.
The Company maintains a number of insurance policies including general liability, workers’ compensation, fidelity, fiduciary, directors and officers, cyber, property, and professional liability policies. These policies provide coverage subject to their terms, conditions, limits of liability, and deductibles, for certain liabilities that may arise from our operations. There can be no assurance that any of the above policies will be adequate for our needs, or that we will maintain all such policies in the future.
Regulations
We provide services directly to our clients on a contract basis and receive payment directly from them. However, many of our clients are reimbursed under the federal Medicare program and state Medicaid programs for the services they provide. In recent years, federal and state governments have made significant changes in these programs that have reduced reimbursement rates. In addition, insurance companies and managed care organizations seek to control costs by requiring healthcare providers, such as hospitals, to discount their services in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plans. While not affecting us directly, future federal and state legislation or evolving commercial reimbursement trends may further reduce or change conditions for our clients’ reimbursement. Such limitations on reimbursement could reduce our clients’ cash flows, hampering the pricing we can charge clients and their ability to pay us. We continuously monitor changes in regulations and legislation for potential impacts on our business.
Our business is subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Complex federal and state laws and regulations govern, among other things, the licensure of professionals, the payment of our employees (e.g., wage and hour laws, employment taxes and income tax withholdings, etc.), and the operations of our business generally. We conduct business primarily in the U.S. and are subject to federal and state laws and regulations applicable to our business, which may be amended from time to time. Future federal and state legislation or interpretations thereof may require us to change our business practices. Compliance with all of these applicable rules and regulations require a significant amount of resources. We endeavor to be in compliance with all such rules and regulations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,800 corporate employees. During 2017, we employed an average of 7,397 full-time equivalent field employees in Nurse and Allied Staffing which does not include our Physician Staffing independent 
11

contractors, all of whom are not employees. Throughout 2017 we were not subject to any collective bargaining agreements. However, in October 2015, the employees we have outsourced to a customer in New York under our OWS model, mainly paraprofessionals, voted to be represented by Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union. We began negotiating with Local 1199 for an initial collective bargaining agreement in 2016 to cover the terms and conditions of employment for these employees (approximately 450 employees) and expect those negotiations to result in an agreement in 2018. We consider our relationship with employees to be good.
