Sales and Distribution Channels
We sell our robotic floor care products through distributor and retail sales channels, as well as the online store on our website and through our Home App. We plan to integrate the Aeris air purifier products into our channels as applicable while continuing to support existing business-to-business sales to schools, medical and dental offices and other commercial enterprises. For the fiscal years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, sales to non-U.S. customers accounted for 51.8%, 47.9%, and 50.3% of total revenue, respectively. For the fiscal years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, we generated 21.8%, 22.7% and 21.3% of total revenue, respectively, from one of our retailers. 
In the United States, Canada, Japan and across much of Europe, we sell our consumer products primarily through a network of retailers. To support these retailers, we maintain in-house sales, marketing and product management teams. Certain smaller retail operations in these regions are supported by distributors to whom we sell our products directly. Throughout the rest of the world, our products are sold primarily through a network of in-country distributors who resell to retail stores in their respective countries. These distributors are supported by our international sales and product marketing team.
Our retail and distributor networks are our primary distribution channels for our products. Complementing our retail and distributor networks is a growing direct-to-consumer sales channel. For the fiscal years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, direct sales to consumers accounted for 12.0%, 10.5% and 5.8% of total revenue, respectively. We ended 2021 with approximately 14 million connected customers who have opted in to our digital communications, an increase of 44% over the end of 2020.
Customer Service and Support
We also provide ongoing customer service and support, which is critical to the “Keep” element of our strategy. Consumer customer service representatives, the majority of whom are employees of outsourced service organizations or our distribution partners, are extensively trained on the technical intricacies of our consumer products. With Wi-Fi connectivity implemented across the vast majority of our floor cleaning robots, we can provide customer support directly via the iRobot HOME App, and our customer service representatives can access robot performance information remotely to identify relevant issues and behaviors to more efficiently and effectively troubleshoot and address customer questions and concerns. In addition, this connectivity enables us to provide direct marketing material, and deliver new features and enhanced functionality to robots in the field. Customer care is also an important differentiator in our robots-as-a-service offering. We believe that working closely with members of our subscription services will help elevate the utility of our floor care robots, increase overall customer satisfaction and maximize ongoing member retention. 
Marketing and Brand
We market our consumer robots to end-user customers through our extensive network of retail partners with the support of our sales and marketing teams as well as in collaborations with in-country distributors. In addition, we sell directly to consumers through our e-commerce channels around the world and continually improve the buying experience on our website and Home App. For consumers seeking information about our products, the iRobot website showcases our brand, allows consumers to learn more about our products, including the latest product innovations, and enables direct-to-consumer sales. The website also plays an important after-sales role for owners seeking spare parts and accessories, as well as for trouble-shooting possible issues and contacting customer support.
Our marketing strategy is to drive consumer awareness of and interest in iRobot's product portfolio and convert this interest into sales via our retail and direct-to-consumer channels. Our sales and marketing expenses represented 18.5%, 18.6% and 19.1% of our total revenue in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in national advertising across a range of media, direct marketing and public relations to drive consumer demand and further build brand awareness. 
Marketing highlights in 2021 included continued progress to upgrade our marketing technology infrastructure and enhance the e-commerce functionality on iRobot.com and our HOME App. We also supported the launches of the iRobot Genius Home Intelligence platform, the j7 Series Roomba in the United States and Europe, and the iRobot H1 handheld vacuum as well as efforts to begin scaling our subscription services in the U.S. and Japan. Additionally, we invested to further elevate the iRobot brand and align it with our “So You Can Human” marketing campaign. Related to these specific initiatives, we have continued to fund critical marketing, advertising and public relations efforts to build demand generation in ways that amplify the iRobot and applicable product brands, generate consumer interest in our products and perpetuate customer word-of-mouth, to encourage repeat purchases by existing customers and inspire new customers to buy our products. During 2022, key marketing initiatives include moving into production with our marketing technology systems and tools in key regions around the globe, rebranding and marketing the Aeris air purification products and continuing our efforts to elevate the iRobot brand globally to support continued demand for our offerings. 
Manufacturing
Our core competencies are the design, development and marketing of robots. Our manufacturing strategy is to outsource non-core competencies, such as the production of our robots, to third-party entities skilled in manufacturing. By relying on the outsourced manufacture of our robots, we can focus our engineering expertise on the design of robots and associated technologies.
Manufacturing a new product requires a close relationship between our product designers, our operations teams and the contract manufacturer, as well as a range of component and raw materials suppliers as appropriate. Using multiple engineering techniques, our products are introduced to the selected production facility at an early-development stage and the feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before tooling is finalized and mass production begins. As a result, we believe that we can significantly reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries, with improved quality and yields. Once a new product has been introduced, we focus on executing a multi-year plan to improve its profitability through a combination of higher production volume and cost-optimization initiatives. 
Under our agreements with our contract manufacturers, the manufacturers supply us with specified quantities of products that align with demand forecasts that we establish based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions. We believe that we have taken steps to diversify our manufacturing so that overall volumes are relatively well balanced across our multiple contract manufacturers and a substantial majority of volume is dual sourced. We expect our production processes will give us the capacity to produce up to 37,000 robots a day in 2022, helping us to meet demand for peak seasons and provide us with additional greater geographical diversity and flexibility to respond to ever-changing market conditions.
We outsource the manufacturing of our consumer products to multiple contract manufacturers with plants in Southern China and Malaysia. During 2021, we continued to scale production in Malaysia by qualifying additional contract manufacturers. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected and delayed our effort to fully diversify our supply chain into Malaysia during fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, we plan to continue to scale and expand production in Malaysia with the goal of having the majority of our U.S. volume produced in Malaysia so that we can substantially reduce our exposure to current U.S. tariffs in 2023, and mitigate the geopolitical risks associated with concentrating production solely in China. We also continue to explore potential expansion of our manufacturing footprint into regions that will help us lower overall supply chain costs. 
During 2021, we encountered many supply chain challenges driven primarily by the COVID-19 pandemic consistent with its effect across many industries, including limited availability and rising costs for semiconductor components, higher raw materials costs and increased oceanic and air transportation expenses. We anticipate that higher supply chain costs, particularly those involving oceanic transportation, will continue to impact our business during 2022 and that our access to semiconductor componentry will remain limited through at least the first half of 2022. In addition, port congestion and warehouse labor shortages have caused and are expected to continue causing shipping delays and longer-than-expected shipping times. We are implementing a range of initiatives aimed at improving our supply chain continuity and resiliency, increasing our operational efficiency and effectiveness to help us capitalize on our most promising growth prospects, and enhancing product flexibility, quality and time-to-market. 
Research and Development
Our research and development team develops new software and hardware products, as well as improves and enhances our existing software to address customer demands and emerging trends. We believe that our future success depends upon our ability to continue to develop new products and product accessories, and enhance and develop new applications for our existing products. For the years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, our research and development expenses were $161.3 million, $156.7 million and $141.6 million, or 10.3%, 11.0% and 11.7% of revenue, respectively. We intend to continue our investment in research and development to respond to and anticipate customer needs, and to enable us to introduce new products that will continue to address our existing and adjacent market sectors.
Our research and development is conducted by teams dedicated to particular projects, which are primarily located at our headquarters in Bedford, Massachusetts and our office in Pasadena, California.
Competition
The market for robots, including floor cleaning robots, is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to changing technologies, shifting customer needs and expectations, with an increasing number of competitor companies and products. As the performance, functionality and features of our floor cleaning robots have advanced, we believe that consumers are increasingly willing to consider our products as replacements for their traditional vacuum cleaners and wet floor cleaning products. A number of established companies have developed robots that compete directly with our product offerings, and many of our competitors have significantly more financial and other resources than we possess. Our robot cleaning competitors include consumer electronics and consumer appliance companies such as Samsung, LG, Panasonic, Xiaomi, Cecotec, Hitachi, Electrolux, Midea and Shark, traditional floor cleaning brands with robotic offerings such as Dyson, Bissell and Hoover, and firms primarily focused on robotic cleaning such as Ecovacs, Roborock, Neato and iLife. In addition, several competitors market floor cleaning robots that consolidate both vacuuming and mopping in a single product. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market for robots include product features, performance for the intended mission, total cost of system operation and overall perceived value, including maintenance and support, ease of use, integration with existing equipment, quality, reliability, brand and reputation.
The market for air purifiers is also highly competitive with an increasing number of competitors and products along with the potential for emerging technologies to disrupt the marketplace. A number of companies offer air purifiers that compete directly with ours, and many of these competitors possess greater financial strength and better access to other resources than we do. Our air purifier competitors include consumer and industrial appliance and electronics companies such as Honeywell, Dyson, Holmes and Levoit, as well as specialized home health companies that focus extensively on air purification with premium products such as Blue Air, Molekule, Alen Air, Austin Air and IQAir. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market for air purifiers include the ability to improve air quality by removing a wide range of pollutants, measure 
air quality and other features that provide greater insight into and control over the product’s performance, total cost and overall perceived value, including maintenance and support, ease of use, integration with other connected devices in the home, product quality, reliability, brand and reputation. 
Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of product development, customer support, and ability to leverage our Genius platform across our products. We remain committed to funding the enhancement of our products and the development of new products, as well as investing in the various sales, marketing and support activities we believe are necessary to stimulate customer demand and maintain and improve customer satisfaction. 
Intellectual Property
We believe that our continued success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, the technical competence and ability of our employees to continue to innovate. The ownership of intellectual property rights is an important factor in our business. This includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the United States and a number of foreign countries. We currently hold a significant number of patents and have filed numerous additional patent applications. As of January 1, 2022, we held 567 U.S. patents, more than 1,000 foreign patents, additional design registrations, and have more than 450 patent applications pending worldwide. While our U.S. patents began to expire in 2021, no single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting our products. We will continue to file and prosecute patent (or design registration, as applicable) applications when and where appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. We also encourage our employees to continue to invent and develop new technologies so as to maintain our competitiveness in the marketplace. It is possible that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part. It is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents for our pending patent applications or other inventions we seek to protect. In that regard, we sometimes permit certain intellectual property to lapse or go abandoned under appropriate circumstances. It is also possible that we may not develop proprietary products or technologies in the future that are patentable, or that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will harm or altogether preclude our ability to do business.
Our registered U.S. trademarks include iRobot and its stylized logo, Roomba, Clean Base, NorthStar, Create, Clean Map, iAdapt, Home Base, Looj, Braava, Braava jet, AeroForce, AllergenLock, Better Together, PerfectEdge, Corners. Edges. And the Details in Between., Imprint, Mirra, Root, Terra, vSLAM and Virtual Wall. Our marks iRobot, Roomba, Braava, Braava jet, Better Together, Root, Clean Base, Clean Map, Imprint, PerfectEdge, Terra, Virtual Wall, and certain other trademarks, have also been registered in selected foreign countries.
Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate, and our competitors may independently develop technology that is similar to ours. Legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Some of our competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and low-cost structures while infringing on our intellectual property. 
On October 15, 2019, we initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in federal district court in Massachusetts against SharkNinja Operating LLC and its related entities ("SharkNinja") for infringement of five patents for technology related to robotic vacuum cleaners. In addition, we sought a preliminary injunction against SharkNinja for infringement of three U.S. patents. SharkNinja has in parallel sought declarations of non-infringement of thirteen U.S. patents owned by iRobot. On November 26, 2019, the federal district court in Massachusetts denied iRobot's motion for a preliminary injunction, and the case is currently stayed pending the outcome of one or more appeals from decisions of the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board. On January 28, 2021, we initiated litigation against SharkNinja at the U.S. International Trade Commission ("ITC") as well as in federal district court in Massachusetts based on claims of patent infringement of five additional U.S. patents related to robotic vacuum cleaners. The trial began in January 2022.
There is no guarantee that we will prevail on other patent infringement claims against third parties. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected products less valuable, if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace. In addition, if any of our products or the technology underlying our products is covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, we could be subject to various legal actions. We cannot assure you that our products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future. We have received in the past communications from third parties relating to technologies used in our various robot products that have alleged infringement of patents or violation of other intellectual property rights. Some of these allegations have resulted in actions filed against iRobot in foreign jurisdictions. In response to these communications, we have contacted these third parties to convey our good faith belief that we do not infringe the patents in question or otherwise violate those parties' rights. Where an action has been filed, we will defend iRobot against the allegations. We cannot assure you that we will not receive further correspondence from these parties, not be subject to additional allegations of infringement from others, and cannot assure you that iRobot will prevail in any ongoing or 
subsequently filed actions. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. Moreover, any settlement of or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the technology that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. Any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we attempt to design around the technology at issue or to find another provider of suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering applicable software or product solutions, our continued supply of software or product solutions could be disrupted or our introduction of new or enhanced software or products could be significantly delayed.
Seasonality
Historically, we have experienced higher revenue in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year due in large part to seasonal holiday demand. For the years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, our second-half consumer product revenue represented 57.3%, 67.0% and 59.0% of our annual consumer product revenue, respectively. We have also experienced higher selling and marketing expenses in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year due to increased marketing campaigns to support seasonal holiday demand. In fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, our selling and marketing expense in the second half of the year represented 56.0%, 67.7% and 58.9% of our selling and marketing expense for full fiscal year, respectively. We expect that the majority of our revenue and selling and marketing expenses will continue to be generated in the second half of any given fiscal year unless or until we successfully introduce new products that have potential to generate stronger sales during the first half of the year.
Regulations
Our business requires compliance with a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection, and data security. In particular, we are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other user data, including the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and California Consumer Privacy Act. In addition, the global nature of our business operations also creates various domestic and foreign regulatory challenges and subjects us to laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions. Our products may be subject to U.S. export controls, including the United States Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls and trade policies and tariffs established by the governments of the United States, China and other jurisdictions where we do business.
The laws in each of these areas - in particular those related to data privacy - are continually changing and evolving in unpredictable ways. New laws and regulations in any of these areas, as well as compliance with these laws (and their derivatives) may have an adverse effect on our business. If we fail to comply with these laws, we may be subject to significant liabilities and other penalties.
We are also subject to international and U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, regulate energy efficiency and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. We believe that our policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and associated financial liability. To date, environmental control regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on our overall operations.
Human Capital
As of January 1, 2022, we had 1,372 full-time employees. Approximately 30% of our employees are based outside of the United States. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. In certain foreign subsidiaries, labor unions or workers’ councils represent some of our employees. To date, we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
Culture and Work Environment 
Over the past three decades, iRobot has created and amplified a unique culture built on fostering invention, discovery and technological exploration in the pursuit of practical and value-add robot products for the next-generation home. iRobot is committed to attracting and retaining the best and brightest talent, leveraging new perspectives, ideas, skills, languages and cultural backgrounds and providing the resources for individuals to reach their full potential. We’ve assembled a global team of talented, motivated and unique individuals by providing our people with opportunities to make a tangible impact in helping our company thrive while also advancing their careers. In addition, iRobot’s culture is further shaped by an ongoing commitment to the future of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ("STEM") education. This effort spans our educational robots, a range of complementary educational resources and our STEM outreach program, which is focused on engaging and inspiring 
students of all ages to learn more about robotics. We communicate regularly with our employees around the world and hold periodic virtual town hall meetings and in-person forums when appropriate to help keep employees informed. 
Underpinning our culture is an ongoing commitment to ensuring that our employees, customers and suppliers are treated with dignity and respect. We strive to maintain a workplace that is free from violence, harassment, intimidation and other unsafe or disruptive conditions. Our policy is to provide a safe and healthy workplace and comply with applicable safety and health laws and regulations, as well as internal requirements. Additionally, the safety and health of our employees is of paramount importance to us, particularly as we continue to navigate the direct and indirect challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the many actions taken to support our employees during the pandemic and protect their health and well-being, we have continued to adjust our global travel policies, maintain flexible work from home policies, and implement a wide range of sanitization and cleaning protocols to keep our offices safer. We have also offered special sick leave for employees who have, or whose family have, possible COVID-19 symptoms. During 2022, we plan to require vaccination for those employees with roles that can only be performed in our U.S. offices or for those employees, interns, contractors, partners, service providers, suppliers, and visitors who wish to conduct business in our U.S. offices. In addition, our employees proactively donated time, resources and technology to support healthcare workers on the front lines. We have also supported several COVID-19 relief initiatives, such as donating thousands of masks from our manufacturing facilities to healthcare workers, participating in a project to repurpose Roomba filters for use in personal protective equipment, and releasing numerous free online and offline learning materials for both teachers and students.
Compensation, Rewards and Benefits
In addition to competitive base salaries, we provide incentive-based compensation programs to reward performance relative to key metrics. We also provide compensation in the form of restricted stock unit grants as well as a competitive time-off policy. We offer comprehensive benefit options, including retirement savings plans, medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, life and disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, and an employee stock purchase plan, among others. 
We are committed to the continued development of our people. We offer opportunities for personal and technical development with programs such as our leadership training, management training, mentoring program and educational assistance. We continue to evolve our approach to attracting and retaining our talent – from having a well-defined process for hiring to continuing to enhance our compensation and benefits packages.
Diversity and Inclusion
iRobot is an inclusive organization, seeking out the best and brightest minds to help us meet the global requirements of our business. We are excited to welcome new perspectives, ideas, skills, languages and cultural backgrounds to our global iRobot family.
The iRobot community is built upon the diverse perspectives, beliefs and backgrounds of incredibly talented people from around the world who have all had a hand in shaping who we are as an organization. Strengthening diversity within our global workforce enables iRobot to bring our collective ideas together to invent a future that seamlessly fits the unique, personal and diverse needs of our global consumer base. We have and will continue to take action and hold ourselves accountable to continue to foster equality and diversity on a global scale. Each day we learn from each other, grow and evolve, seeking out new opportunities to strengthen our support for all employees and the communities in which we work. We have taken a number of actions and implemented a range of initiatives to establish an ongoing dialogue with our employees about diversity in the workplace and to help advance inclusivity in our offices.
