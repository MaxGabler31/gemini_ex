Item 1. | BUSINESS
---------+---------

General 
 Hub Group, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on March 8, 1995. We are a world class provider of multimodal logistics solutions. We offer comprehensive intermodal, truck brokerage, dedicated and logistics services. Since our founding in 1971, we have grown to become one of the largest intermodal and truck brokerage providers in the United States. Through our network, we have the ability to arrange for the movement of freight in and out of every major city in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We utilize an asset-light strategy in order to minimize our investment in equipment and facilities and reduce our capital requirements. We arrange freight movement for our customers through transportation carriers and equipment providers. 
 Hub Group Trucking, Inc. (“HGT”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Hub Group, Inc., acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Estenson Logistics, LLC (“Estenson”) on July 1, 2017 (the “Estenson Acquisition”).  Estenson is now our wholly owned subsidiary, operating under the name Hub Group Dedicated (“HGD”).  As a result of the Estenson Acquisition, HGT acquired substantially all of the assets of Estenson, which include tractors and trailers, as well as assumed certain liabilities, including equipment debt.  HGT and HGD are included in the Hub segment.
 Mode Transportation, LLC (“Mode LLC”) is our wholly-owned subsidiary acquired in 2011, and operates independently. Mode LLC has approximately 173 agents, consisting of 99 IBOs, who sell services and operate the business throughout North America and 74 sales only agents. Mode also has a temperature protected services division operated out of our Oak Brook, IL headquarters and corporate offices in Memphis, TN and Dallas, TX. 
 Mode LLC diversifies Hub Group’s customer base with more small and medium sized customers, as Hub has traditionally focused, to a significant degree, on larger national accounts.  Mode IBOs and sales agents are often able to devote more attention to smaller and medium sized shippers and develop long-term relationships with them. 
 We report two distinct business segments. The first segment is “Mode,” which includes the Mode LLC business only. Mode LLC markets and operates its freight transportation services primarily through its network of IBOs who enter into contracts with Mode LLC. The second segment is “Hub,” which is all business other than Mode. Hub operates through a network of operating centers throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. Hub services a large and diversified customer base in a broad range of industries, including consumer products, retail and durable goods.  Hub includes our dedicated service offering and both segments offer intermodal, truck brokerage and logistics services. “Hub Group” includes both segments. 
 Services Provided
Our transportation services for both the Hub and the Mode segments can be broadly placed into the following categories: 
 Intermodal. As an intermodal provider, we arrange for the movement of our customers’ freight in containers and trailers, typically over long distances of 750 miles or more. We contract with railroads to provide transportation for the long-haul portion of the shipment and with local trucking companies, known as “drayage companies,” for pickup and delivery. As part of our intermodal services, we negotiate rail and drayage rates, electronically track shipments in transit, consolidate billing and handle claims for freight loss or damage on behalf of our customers. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we owned a total of approximately 32,000 53-foot private containers and we had exclusive access to approximately 2,500 rail-owned containers for our dedicated use on the Union Pacific (“UP”) and the Norfolk Southern (“NS”) rails. We use our network to access containers and trailers owned by leasing companies, railroads and steamship lines. We are able to track trailers and containers entering a service area and reuse that equipment to fulfill the customers’ outbound shipping requirements. This effectively allows us to “capture” containers and trailers that we do not own or have exclusive access to and keep them within our network. 
 During 2017, HGT accounted for approximately 54% of Hub’s drayage needs by assisting us in providing reliable, cost effective intermodal services to our customers. As of December 31, 2017 HGT had terminals in Atlanta, Birmingham, Charlotte, Chattanooga, Chicago, Dallas, Harrisburg, Huntsville, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Kalamazoo, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Memphis, Nashville, Newark, Philadelphia, Portland (OR), Salt Lake City, Seattle, St. Louis, Stockton and Wilmington (IL) metro areas. As of December 31, 2017, HGT leased or owned approximately 900 tractors and 300 trailers, employed approximately 1,000 drivers and contracted with approximately 1,500 owner-operators. 
 2

Dedicated: Our dedicated service line, HGD, contracts with customers looking to outsource a portion of their transportation needs. We offer a dedicated fleet of equipment and drivers to each customer, as well as the management and infrastructure to operate according to the customer’s high service expectations. Our dedicated service line currently operates a fleet of approximately 1,100 tractors and 4,700 trailers at 125 locations throughout the United States.  As of December 31, 2017, HGD employed 1,294 drivers.
 Truck Brokerage (Highway Services). We are one of the largest truck brokers in the United States, providing customers with a highway service option for their transportation needs. We match the customers’ needs with carriers’ capacity to provide the most effective service and price combination. We have contracts with a substantial base of carriers allowing us to meet the varied needs of our customers. As part of the truck brokerage services, we negotiate rates, track shipments in transit and handle claims for freight loss and damage on behalf of our customers. 
 Logistics and Other Services. Hub’s logistics business operates under the name of Unyson Logistics. Unyson Logistics is comprised of a network of logistics professionals dedicated to developing, implementing and operating customized logistics solutions for customers. Unyson Logistics offers a wide range of transportation management services and technology solutions including shipment optimization, load consolidation, mode selection, carrier management, load planning and execution and web-based shipment visibility. Unyson Logistics operates throughout North America, providing services through its main operating location in St. Louis with additional support locations in the Boston, Chicago, Cleveland and Minneapolis metro areas. In addition, certain Mode LLC agents also provide logistics services. Our multi-modal transportation capabilities for both the Hub and Mode segments include small parcel, heavyweight, expedited, less-than-truckload, truckload, intermodal, railcar and international shipping. 
 Hub and Mode LLC Networks
 Hub’s entire network is interactively connected through Hub’s proprietary Network Management System and Mode LLC’s network is connected through its third party transportation management system. This enables us to arrange for the movement of freight into and out of every major city in the United States, Canada and Mexico. 
 In a typical intermodal transaction, the customer contacts one of Hub’s intermodal operating centers or a Mode LLC IBO to place an order. The operating center/IBO determines the price, obtains the necessary intermodal equipment, arranges for the equipment to be delivered to the customer by a drayage company and, after the freight is loaded, arranges for the transportation of the container or trailer to the rail ramp. Relevant information is entered into our system by the assigned operating center/IBO. Our predictive track and trace technology then monitors the shipment to ensure that it arrives as scheduled and alerts the customer service personnel if there are service delays. The operating center/IBO then arranges for and confirms delivery by a drayage company at the destination. After unloading, the empty equipment is made available for reloading by the operating center/IBO for the delivery market. 
 We provide truck brokerage services to our customers in a similar manner. In a typical truck brokerage transaction, the customer contacts one of Hub’s highway operating centers or a Mode LLC IBO to obtain a price quote for a particular freight movement. The customer then provides appropriate shipping information to the operating center/IBO. The operating center/IBO makes the delivery appointment and arranges with the appropriate carrier to pick up the freight. Once it receives confirmation that the freight has been picked up, the operating center/IBO monitors the movement of the freight until it reaches its destination and the delivery has been confirmed. If the carrier notifies us that after delivering the load it will need additional freight, we may notify other operating centers/IBOs. Although under no obligation to do so, those operating centers/IBOs may then attempt to secure additional freight for the carrier. 
 Marketing and Customers 
 As one of the world’s leading transportation management companies, Hub Group is committed to providing multi-modal solutions throughout North America, including intermodal, dedicated, truck brokerage and logistics services.  We have transformed our organization from a traditional IMC into a multi-modal solutions provider. This change has revolutionized our offerings and the way we service our customers.  We look at our customers’ entire network to provide innovative multi-modal solutions to drive savings, improve service and offer full visibility.
After 47 years in business, we continue to live by the simple mantra that "good" is not good enough. To ensure we grow and improve, we focus intently on our customers, listening to their needs, developing comprehensive transportation solutions and delivering superior service. We invest in our people, equipment and technology to maintain our competitive edge in order to be the best transportation provider for our customers.
 We face a continued need to help our customers meet consumer demands of having products and services through all buying channels. We have been delivering to an already leaner supply chain, with our customers reporting an increase in speed and improved visibility. Our satellite tracking units help to ensure our customers have the capacity they need.  Our state-of-the-art technology helps to maintain our high levels of service while providing 24/7 visibility into any shipment; and our people have the skills, training and information to quickly respond to our customers' changing supply chain network. Supporting every customer is a dedicated team of

professionals ready to service any and all of our customers' needs. We call this exceptional service approach the "One Hub" experience.
 The majority of our business is in the retail, consumer products, durable goods and automotive verticals.  No one customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue in 2017 and 2016 in either reporting segment.
 Information Technology Systems 
 Based on the technology requirements for our business strategy and to keep pace with changing technologies and customer demand, we are making investments in both our back-office technology such as our ERP system and emerging technology.  The investments to enhance our existing technology include implementing new order management, transportation management and financial management processes and systems.  In addition, we anticipate making investments in artificial intelligence and automation technology to further drive innovation and efficiency throughout the organization and to support enhanced service to our customers.
 In 2017, we launched Hub Group Connect, our new digital platform for customers.  This product was developed using open source technology and is based on a responsive design that allows our customers to use any type of device to connect with our services. Hub Group Connect allows all of our customers to interact with their order throughout its lifecycle. During 2018 we will continue to provide additional features to Hub Group Connect which will create value for our customers.
 In 2017, we also introduced our first completely mobile solution for company and owner operator drivers.  We deployed this differentiating application to drivers on tablets. The features of the application and tablet combination also allowed us to replace a legacy paper scanning solution used to submit order paperwork.  This application also allows a driver to find a Hub Group container based on the location information provided via our GPS technology installed on our Hub Group containers.  We will continue to deliver new technology capabilities in 2018 leveraging our cloud services for immediate deployment to all devices. Our Cloud First technology strategy is providing the expected benefit at the rate and pace at which we can deliver new and innovative technology solutions, while lowering the cost to serve our customers and maintain our high level of service quality. 
 In addition, in 2017, we implemented solutions for several new Unyson customers using Oracle Transportation Management (OTM).  These customers benefited from our ability to create sophisticated solutions that included multi-leg order optimization and iterative consolidation as well as customer unique web-based dashboards that provide insights to supply chain efficiency and vendor compliance.  
 Mode LLC utilizes a dynamic transportation management platform that integrates best in class third party technologies to manage its business.  This platform includes an execution system that provides multi-modal solutions, visibility to status of shipments, facilitation of customer billing, and a robust portal that allows exchange of information about loads, capacity, and event status information between transportation providers and our customers.  Additionally Mode LLC’s platform consists of components that allow for optimization of our customer’s order process, management of our diverse carrier base, and robust analytics and business intelligence solutions that allow our customers to better understand outcomes and opportunities within their supply chain.  This platform provides a robust and scalable technological solution that can meet the needs of a growing transportation network.
 Relationship with Railroads 
 A key element of our business strategy is to strengthen our close working relationships with the major intermodal railroads in North America. Due to our size and relative importance, some railroads have dedicated support personnel to focus on our day-to-day service requirements. On a regular basis, our senior executives and each of the railroads meet to discuss major strategic issues concerning intermodal transportation. 
 We have relationships with each of the following major railroads: 
 
 
Burlington Northern Santa Fe | Florida East Coast 
-----------------------------+---------------------
Canadian National | Kansas City Southern
Canadian Pacific | Norfolk Southern 
CSX | Union Pacific 
Ferromex | 

 Transportation rates are market driven. We sometimes negotiate with the railroads or other major service providers on a route or customer specific basis. Consistent with industry practice, some of the rates we negotiate are special commodity quotations (“SCQs”), which provide discounts from published price lists based on competitive market factors and are designed by the railroads or major service providers to attract new business or to retain existing business.  SCQ rates apply to specific customers in specified shipping lanes for a specific period of time, usually up to 12 months.

Relationship with Drayage Companies 
 Hub has a “Quality Drayage Program,” under which participants commit to provide high quality drayage service along with clean and safe equipment, maintain a defined on-time performance level and follow specified procedures designed to minimize freight loss and damage. We negotiate drayage rates for transportation between specific origin and destination points. 
 We also provide drayage services with our own drayage operations, which we operate through our subsidiary HGT. Our drayage operations employ their own drivers and also contract with owner-operators who supply their own trucks. 
 Relationship with Trucking Companies 
 Our truck brokerage operation has a large number of trucking companies that we use to transport freight. The Hub operating centers and Mode IBOs deal daily with these carriers on an operational level. Our corporate headquarters handles the administrative and regulatory aspects of the trucking company relationships. Our relationships with these trucking companies are important since these relationships determine pricing, load coverage and overall service. 
Risk Management and Insurance 
 We require all drayage companies participating in Hub’s Quality Drayage Program to carry general liability insurance, truckman’s auto liability insurance and cargo insurance. Railroads, which are self-insured, provide limited cargo protection. To cover freight loss or damage when a carrier’s liability cannot be established or a carrier’s insurance is insufficient to cover the claim, we carry our own cargo insurance. We also carry general liability insurance with a companion umbrella policy on this general liability insurance.
We maintain separate insurance policies to cover potential exposure from our company-owned drayage and dedicated operations. We carry commercial general liability insurance subject to a policy aggregate limit, and trucker’s automobile liability insurance with a limit per occurrence. Additionally, we have an umbrella excess liability policy and maintain motor truck cargo liability insurance.
 Government Regulation 
 The company and several of our subsidiaries, including HGD and Mode LLC, are licensed by the Department of Transportation as brokers in arranging for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle. To the extent that the Hub operating centers and Mode LLC IBOs perform truck brokerage services, they do so under these licenses. The Department of Transportation prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity, including a $75,000 surety bond that we have posted. In addition, Hub and Mode LLC each have customs bonds. To date, compliance with these regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition; however, the transportation industry is subject to legislative or regulatory changes that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and cost of providing, transportation services. 
Custom-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism 
 We achieved Custom-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) certification in 2013 and have maintained it since then. C-TPAT is a voluntary supply chain security program led by U.S. Customs and Border Protection focused on improving the security of private companies’ supply chains with respect to terrorism. Companies who achieve C-TPAT certification must have a documented process for determining and alleviating risks throughout their international supply chain. This certification allows us to be considered low risk, resulting in expedited processing of our customers’ cargo, including fewer customs examinations. 
Competition 
 The transportation services industry is highly competitive. We compete against intermodal providers, as well as logistics companies, third party brokers, trucking companies and railroads that market their own intermodal services. Several larger trucking companies have entered into agreements with railroads to market intermodal services nationwide. Competition is based primarily on freight rates, quality of service, reliability, transit time and scope of operations. Several transportation service companies and trucking companies, and all of the major railroads, may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do.

We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.
