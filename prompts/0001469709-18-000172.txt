ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

We are an online gambling company. We offer persons (which we sometimes refer to as players) the ability to wager on a wide variety of esports events in a licensed and secure environment. Esports is the competitive playing of video games by amateur and professional teams for cash prizes. Esports event gambling involves players wagering online on the outcome of professional esports events. In the future, we intend to also offer players the ability to participate in video game tournaments for cash prizes. 

We were incorporated in Nevada on July 22, 2008. Our company was engaged in a number of different enterprises up until May 20, 2013, when, pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of H&H Arizona in exchange for 50,000,000 shares of our common stock. From May 2013 until August 2018, our operations were limited to designing, developing and testing our wagering systems. We launched our online esports wagering website (www.vie.gg) in August 2018. We are currently the only online gambling company focused on esports to offer bet exchange style wagering, player VS player (PvP) betting, on professional esports events.
 
Esports is video game played competitively for spectators, typically by professional gamers. Esports typically takes the form of organized, multiplayer video games that include real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena games. A well-known example of an Esport game is Call of Duty. Currently, however, the two largest selling esports games are Dota 2, League of Legends (a multiplayer online battle arena game) and Counter Strike: Global Offensive (a first-person shooter game). Other popular games include Smite, StarCraft II, Call of Duty¸ Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone and Fortnite. Esports also includes games which can be played, primarily by amateurs, in multiplayer competitions such as WII (Nintendo), and Halo (343 Industries). Most major professional esports events and a wide range of amateur esports events are broadcast live via streaming services including, twitch.tv, azubu.tv, ustream.tv and youtube.com.

According to market research firm Newzoo, in 2018 the total global esports audience will reach 380.2 million. Esports Enthusiasts, which are people who watch professional esports content at least once a month, will make up 165.0 million of the total up from 143.2 million in 2017, and will grow with a CAGR (2016-2021) of +15.6% to reach almost 250 million in 2021. The number of Occasional Viewers, which are people who watch professional esports content less than once a month, will reach 215.2 million in 2018, up from 191.9 million in 2017, and will grow with a CAGR of +14.0% to surpass 306 million in 2021. The number of people who are aware of esports worldwide will reach 1.6 billion in 2018, up from 1.3 billion in 2017. China is expected to contribute most to global esports awareness, with 468.3 million people aware of esports. The increasing exposure of esports as a mainstream entertainment industry is driving the growth in awareness in most regions. Audience and awareness growth in the emerging regions of Latin America, Middle East and Africa, Southeast Asia, and Rest of Asia is largely driven by improving IT infrastructure and urbanization. The rise of new franchises, such as PLAYERUNKNOWNS BATTLEGROUNDS or PubG, is an important global growth factor. The influx of millennials, to whom esports is a natural phenomenon, will further drive the growth of the industrys audience.

In 2017, there were 588 major esports events that generated an estimated $59 million in ticket revenues, up from $32 million in 2016. The total prize money of all esports events held in 2017 reached $112 million, breaking the $100 million mark for the first year. 

Forbes magazine projects fans of esports will wager $23 billion on professional esports events by 2020.

Although official competitions have long been a part of video game culture, participation and spectatorship of such events have seen a massive global surge in popularity with the rapid growth of online streaming over the last few years. The advent of online streaming technology has turned esports into a global industry that includes professional players and teams competing in major events that are simultaneously watched in person in stadiums (which are often sold out), and by online viewers (which regularly exceed 1,000,000 for major tournaments). The impact has been so significant, that many video game developers now build features into their games designed to facilitate competition.

Online Operations

The online gambling market represents one of the fastest growing segments of the gambling industry. H2 Gambling Capital, a leading supplier of data and market intelligence on the global gambling industry, estimates the current size of the global online gambling market is in excess of US$50 billion and is projected to reach US$81 billion by 2022.

We are focused solely on offering online wagering on the widest range of esports events broadcast from around the world, as well as hosting online video game tournaments for enthusiasts in the future. We do not offer online users traditional casino style games such as poker, craps or slots, nor will we offer online wagering on traditional sporting events such as football or soccer.

At our website, www.vie.gg, we offer esports enthusiasts in certain countries the ability to wager on a wide range of professional esports events. Utilizing our peer-to-peer wagering system, we offer real money betting exchange style wagering on esports events from around the world.
A betting exchange allows players to bet against each other rather than a bookmaker. Players can offer odds to, or request odds from, fellow gamblers. Where traditional bookmakers risk going head-to-head with gamblers on markets, a betting exchange takes on no risk at all. Instead, a betting exchange provides the platform for its customers to match bets against each other and takes a small commission on winnings. Betting exchanges are becoming an increasingly integral part of the global gambling landscape, in many cases offering customers much better odds, more transparency, and an experience that feels intuitively fairer. 

We have been issued a Client Provider Authorization Permit from the Kahnawake Gaming Commission in Canada and an eGaming License in Curacao (Kingdom of the Netherlands). All persons 18 years and older can presently place bets on our online gambling website at www.vie.gg except for residents of the following countries:

·
 United States
 ·
 European Union member countries
 ·
 Turkey
 ·
 Singapore
 ·
 Colombia

To allow residents of certain European Union member countries to place bets on our website we have applied for an online gambling license from the country of Malta. If granted, residents of 22 European Union countries would be able to place bets on our website.

Once on our online gaming website www.vie.gg, a player can place a bet on a team participating in any number of tournaments which are scheduled to be held in the upcoming week or weeks. A player can either start the bet, using whatever odds are chosen by the player, or accept a bet started by another player. Each bet pertains to a particular game in the tournament. Once the game is over, the winning proceeds, net of our service fee, are electronically transferred to the winning players account.

For our services, we keep from 5.0% to 10.0% of the amount paid to the winning player. 

Esports games are played by professional teams, amateur teams, and individuals. An esports team typically consists of 4 members All professional esports teams have their own social media presence. Some of the top professional esports teams have millions of fans who visit the teams website on a regular basis. A website usually contains information about the team and upcoming esports tournaments or events in which the team will participate.

As part of our efforts to market our online gaming services, we attempt to enter into Affiliate Marketing Agreements with professional esport teams.

As an Affiliate, the esports team will provide their fans with a link to our online gaming website, where the fan, if located in a country which allows the fan to place a bet using our gaming platform, can bet on teams playing in esports tournaments. For a player placing a bet through the teams link to our website www.vie.gg, and provided the player won the bet, we pay the Affiliate a percentage of the amount we collect from the winning bet. As of October 12, 2018, we had more than 170 esports teams agreeing to act as our Affiliates. In addition, we also have more than 100 esports social media influencers agreeing to act as our Affiliates.

We have agreements with the following companies which provide us with certain aspects of our online gaming system:

Money Matrix. MoneyMatrix provides us with the software we use to receive payments from players. Using MoneyMatrix, a player can select from over 150 payment options (i.e. Skrill, Astropay) to deposit funds with us for use in placing bets.

SportRadar. SportRadar, provides our online gaming website with information as to upcoming tournaments, the teams participating in those tournaments, the dates and times of tournament games, and the winners of tournament games.

We pay Swiss Interactive Software a percentage on gaming revenues up to $300,000 annually for this license depending on volume of transactions. 

Ardmore Software SP.Z.O.O. Software development and network administration services are provided by Ardmore Software SP.Z.O.O., a company controlled by Yan Rozum, one of our directors. We pay Ardmore Software a monthly fee of $24,700. 

We also intend to offer players from around the world, excluding 13 states in the United States which currently prohibit playing games of skill for cash prizes, the ability to enter and participate in online video game tournaments and win cash prizes. Skill based video games are not gambling and therefore is not subject to the same laws and regulations as our esports event wagering service. Participants will be able to enter and play against each other with prize money distributed to the last remaining competitors. We will collect a tournament entry fee for scheduled tournaments and will not have any of our capital at risk. Esports Entertainment intends to offer users a wide selection of video games of skill to be played online for real money in small groups to major tournaments at www.vie.gg. Users will be able to enter and participate in tournaments using their PC, game console or mobile device. Players will play against each other in either ring games (i.e., games for cash on a hand-by-hand basis) or in tournaments (i.e., players play against each other for prize money distributed to the last remaining competitors) or variations thereof. None of our money will be at risk since we will collect a percentage of each pot (typically 10%) in games and a tournament entry fee for scheduled tournaments. Esports Entertainment expects to launch online versions of tournament play, initially utilizing simple video games and later more complex video games, under the VIE brand beginning in the first half of 2019.

Grand Princess Casino

In December 2017, we made an offer to purchase the Grand Princess Casino, located in Jolly Harbor, Antigua, for $7,500,000. As of September 30, 2018 and October 12, 2018, we had not paid the deposit required as a condition of the offer and there is no assurance we will do so or consummate the purchase.

If we complete the purchase, Grand Princess Casino will not be operated as a traditional casino. Rather, it will host spectators as they watch live esports events on the main floor, as well as, provide visitors with the opportunity to participate in video game tournaments on the second floor, all under the VIE Esports Coliseum brand.

A live esports event normally involves two or more professional teams which are contracted to participate. The sponsor of the event is typically required to pay the transportation and lodging expenses of the participating 

6

teams. The quality of teams participating is based on the cash prize offered to the winner. As a sponsor of the event, we will be a major contributor to the cash prize pool with the goal of making the prize pool as large as possible so as attract the highest quality teams.

The Grand Princess Casino consists of 62,000 square feet over three floors and will be rebranded as the VIE Esports Coliseum.

Initially, the first floor of the VIE Esports Coliseum will be used to host events arranged by existing and established esports tournament organizers. We intend to work with multiple esports tournament organizers and arrange for them to host one or a series of events at the VIE Esports Coliseum. As a permanent esports event hosting facility, tournament organizers will benefit from the cost efficiency of not having to ship, assemble and then remove the equipment and services needed to host an esports event involving multiple teams, 1,500 spectators and broadcasting in a temporary facility. The VIE Esports Coliseum plans to generate revenue from facilities rental to tournament organizers in the form of a flat fee or as a percentage of ticket sales.

Ultimately, we also intend to organize and host our own esports events on the first floor of the VIE Esports Coliseum. We intend to negotiate with multiple video game publishers to secure the rights to their game software to enable us to host one or more esports events at the VIE Esports Coliseum. The cost of the game software licenses are negotiated individually and can be based on a flat fee, as a percentage of the prize pool, as a percentage of ticket sales, or at no cost. We intend to attract esports spectator demographic focused sponsors and advertisers to make financial contributes to the event prize pool. We intend to enter into agreements with the esports teams from around the world to have them participate in our events. The teams will have the opportunity to compete for the prize pool offered. We intend to broadcast globally all esports events live on multiple video streaming platforms, such as twitch.tv and youtube.com. We intend to market the events primarily through online advertising on esports focused websites and the websites and social media of professional esports players and teams. We plan to generate revenue in the form of ticket sales, third party sponsorship and advertising fees, both at the VIE Esports Coliseum and on online broadcasts of tournaments.

The second floor of the VIE Esports Coliseum is expected to provide a tournament play area with space for up to 200 participants who will play video games among themselves. The tournament play area will be equipped with 200 gaming stations, each of which will include the latest in gaming hardware and accessories, a computer with a large monitor, desk and ergonomic chair. Participants will be able to enter and play against each other for tournament chips with prize money distributed to the last remaining competitors. We will collect a tournament entry fee for scheduled tournaments and will not have any of our own capital at risk. No spectator seating will be available on the second floor and the tournaments played on the second floor will not be broadcast.

The second floor is expected to also host a full-service restaurant and lounge. A portion of the third floor is planned to be a roof top patio bar area. The remainder of the third floor can be utilized for offices.

Marketing

We plan to:

·
 continue our affiliate marketing program with professional esports teams and others.
 ·
 advertise and sponsor major professional esports events held in stadiums around the world that are broadcast online to a global audience.
 ·
 utilize professional esports players and other celebrities who have an interest in video games and esports, to generate new customers.
 ·
 use a multimedia approach focusing on acquiring and retaining customers.

During the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 we plan to spend approximately $3,000,000 on marketing.

Competition

The online gambling and wagering industry is increasingly competitive. With relatively low barriers to entry, new competitors are entering the esports wagering and video game tournament segments. In both of these segments, there currently exist several major competitors. Because many of these competitors focus on delivering one product, as opposed to a full suite of esports and video gambling products and services that Esports Entertainment intends to offer, the competitors may offer an equivalent or superior product to that of the Company. Esports Entertainment expects the number of companies offering products and services in each market segment to increase. Most of our current competitors, including Unikrn, bet365, William Hill, Betway, and Pinnacle Sports, have far greater resources than we have.

We believe the following differentiates us from our competitors:

·
 Peer-to-Peer Wagering Model:

We are currently the first and only esports focused online gambling company to offer bet exchange style wagering and pool betting on professional esports events. Our unique peer-to-peer wagering and gaming model allows the users to wager against other users, with no risk to the Company and a player always wins. The Companys real-money betting exchange style wagering and pool betting enables us to facilitate wagering on a wide range of professional esports events broadcast online. Our peer-to-peer bet exchange platform allows us to offer players the best odds when wagering on esports events.

·
 Esports Focused:

We are focused solely on esports gambling and 18+ gaming. We will not offer users traditional casino style games like poker, craps or slots nor will we offer wagering on traditional sporting events like football or soccer. The Company is focused solely on delivering the widest selection of content and offering the widest range of esports events all for real-money wagering.
Regulations Affecting our Business

The offering and operation of online real-money gambling platforms and related software and solutions is subject to extensive regulation and approval by various federal, state, provincial, tribal and foreign agencies (collectively, gaming authorities). Gambling laws require us to obtain licenses or findings of suitability from gaming authorities for Esports Entertainment, including each of our subsidiaries engaged in these activities, and certain of our directors, officers, employees and in some instances, significant shareholders (typically beneficial owners of more than 5% of a companys outstanding equity). The criteria used by gambling authorities to make determinations as to qualification and suitability of an applicant varies among jurisdictions, but generally require the submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough and sometimes lengthy investigation. Gaming authorities have broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be found suitable. Gambling authorities generally look to the following criteria when determining to grant a license or finding of suitability, including (i) the financial stability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant, (ii) the quality and security of the applicants online real-money platform and gaming equipment and related software, as applicable, and (iii) the past history of the applicant. Gambling authorities may, subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements, (i) deny an application, or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability or approval, and (ii) fine any person licensed, registered or found suitable or approved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, some jurisdictions explicitly prohibit gaming in all or certain forms and we will not market our gambling services in these jurisdictions. If any director, officer or employee of ours fails to qualify for a license or is found unsuitable (including due to the failure to submit the required documentation) by a gaming authority, we may deem it necessary, or be required to, sever our relationship with such person, which may include terminating the employment of any such person. Gambling authorities have the right to investigate any individual or entity having a material relationship with us, to determine whether such individual or entity is suitable or should be licensed to do business as a business associate of ours. In addition, certain gambling authorities monitor the activities of the entities they regulate both in their respective jurisdiction and in other jurisdictions to ensure that these entities are in compliance with local standards on a worldwide basis. 

On May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, a 1992 law that barred state-authorized sports gambling with some exceptions and made Nevada the only state where a person could wager on the results of a single game. Since the Supreme Courts 

8

decision, sports gambling has commenced in several states and several more states have enabling legislation pending. We plan to explore expansion into the US market place when we are ready.

Expansion Plans

Our plans to expand our business depend on the availability of capital and are as follows:

We have applied for an online gambling license in Malta and we intend to establish our office and commence online gambling operations in that jurisdiction within the next 6 months so that we can service much of the European Union market.

We intend to apply for an online gambling license in an Asia jurisdiction and we intend to establish our office and commence online gambling operations in that jurisdiction within the next 18 months. 

We intend to launch our skill-based video game tournaments to be played on mobile devices within the next 6 months. We will license the software required for these tournaments from one of several software firms being interviewed. The software license is expected to require an initial estimated payment of $250,000 and monthly payments of up to $25,000.
