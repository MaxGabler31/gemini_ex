Item 1. Business




General




TSR, Inc. (the “Company,” “TSR,” “we,” “us” and “our”) is a leading staffing company focused on recruiting Information Technology (“IT”) professionals for short and long-term assignments, permanent placements, project work and providing contract computer programming services to its customers. The Company provides its customers with technical computer personnel to supplement their in-house IT capabilities. The Company’s customers for its contract computer programming services consist primarily of Fortune 1000 companies with significant technology budgets. In the year ended May 31, 2022, the Company provided IT staffing services to 62 customers. Also, beginning in the year ended May 31, 2017, the Company has provided and continues to provide contract administrative (non-IT) workers to some of its significant IT customers, including services to provide administrative workers to new customers acquired following the acquisition of Geneva Consulting Group, Inc. (“Geneva”) on September 1, 2020, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this report.



The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1969. The Company’s executive offices are located at 400 Oser Avenue, Suite 150, Hauppauge, NY 11788, and its telephone number is (631) 231-0333. This annual report, and each of our other periodic and current reports, including any amendments, are available, free of charge, on our website, www.tsrconsulting.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this report.



STAFFING SERVICES



The Company’s contract computer programming services involve the provision of technical staff to customers to meet the specialized requirements of their IT operations. The technical personnel provided by the Company generally supplement the in-house capabilities of the Company’s customers. The Company’s approach is to make available to its customers a broad range of technical personnel to meet their requirements rather than focusing on specific specialized areas. The Company has staffing capabilities in the areas of application development in .net and java, mobile applications for Android and IOS platforms, project management, IT security specialists, cloud development and architecture, business analysts, UI design and development, network infrastructure and support and database development and administration. The Company’s services provide customers with flexibility in staffing their day-to-day operations, as well as special projects, on a short-term or long-term basis.



The Company provides technical employees for projects, which usually range from three months to one year. Generally, customers may terminate projects at any time. Staffing services are typically provided at the client’s facility and are billed primarily on an hourly basis based on the actual hours worked by technical personnel provided by the Company and with reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses. The Company pays its technical personnel on a semi-monthly basis and invoices its customers, not less frequently than monthly.



The Company’s success is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to attract, recruit and retain qualified professional IT personnel. The Company believes that there is significant competition for software professionals with the skills and experience necessary to perform the services offered by the Company. Although the Company generally has been successful in attracting employees with the skills needed to fulfill customer engagements, demand for qualified professionals conversant with certain technologies may outstrip supply as new and additional skills are required to keep pace with evolving computer technology or as competition for technical personnel increases. Increasing demand for qualified personnel could also result in increased expenses to hire and retain qualified technical personnel and could adversely affect the Company’s profit margins.

In the past several years, an increasing number of companies are using or are considering using low cost offshore outsourcing centers, particularly in India, to perform technology related work and projects. This trend has contributed to an industry wide decline in domestic IT staffing revenue in some segments. There can be no assurance that this trend will not continue to adversely impact the Company’s IT staffing revenue.



Beginning in the year ended May 31, 2017, the Company began to provide contract administrative (non-IT) workers to support some of its significant IT customers. This service was added at the customers’ request. The skills required for these positions are normally less demanding and the Company has hired a separate recruiting staff to handle this business, which includes both-in house and off-shore recruiters. There can be no assurance that the customers will continue to request these services.




OPERATIONS



The Company provides contract computer programming services primarily in the New York metropolitan area, New England, and the Mid-Atlantic region, although there are also customer locations around the country where the Company places contractors. The Company provides its services principally through offices located in Edison, New Jersey and Long Island, New York. The Company also leases an office space in New York City, but has sublet its New York City office due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Competition from larger competitors for recruiters has created more turnover than expected and increased the cost of retaining recruiters, making it more difficult to increase the number of technical recruiters on staff. As of May 31, 2022, the Company employed 36 persons who are responsible for recruiting technical and non-technical personnel and 12 persons who are account executives. As of May 31, 2021, the Company had employed 29 technical and non-technical recruiters and 13 account executives. For some services, the Company also uses offshore recruiters. The number of offshore recruiters contracted by the Company fluctuates depending on demand for services. At May 31, 2022 and May 31, 2021, the Company contracted for approximately 40 offshore recruiters to provide services to clients.
MARKETING AND CUSTOMERS



The Company focuses its marketing efforts on large businesses and institutions with significant IT budgets and recurring staffing and software development needs. The Company provided services to 62 customers during the year ended May 31, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”) as compared to 61 in the year ended May 31, 2021 (“fiscal 2021”). The Company has historically derived a significant percentage of its total revenue from a relatively small number of customers. In fiscal 2022, the Company had four customers which each provided more than 10% of consolidated revenues: ADP (21.5%), Consolidated Edison (19.4%), Citigroup (15.8%), and AgileOne (11.1%). AgileOne provides vendor management services under an arrangement where the Company enters into a subcontract with AgileOne and AgileOne directly contracts with three end customers. The AgileOne end customers for which the Company provides services include Bristol Myers Squibb, which alone constituted 10.6% of the Company’s consolidated revenue for fiscal 2022. Additionally, the Company’s top ten customers (including underlying customers of vendor management companies) accounted for 86% of consolidated revenue in fiscal 2022 and 81% in fiscal 2021. While continuing its efforts to further expand its client base, including strategically targeted middle market accounts, the Company’s marketing efforts are focused primarily on increasing business from its existing accounts. Approximately 21% of the Company’s revenue is derived from end customers in the financial services business. Competitive pressures in financial services, primarily with European based banks, have negatively affected the net effective rates that the Company charges to certain of the Company’s end customers in this industry, which has negatively affected the Company’s gross profit margins.



Many of the Company’s major customers, totaling over 40% of revenue, have retained a third party to provide vendor management services and centralize the consultant hiring process. Under this system, the third party retains the Company to provide contract computer programming services, the Company bills the third party, and the third party bills the ultimate customer. At certain customers, this process has weakened the relationships the Company has built with its customers’ project managers, who are the Company’s primary contacts with its customers and with whom the Company would normally work to place consultants. Instead, the Company is required to interface with the vendor management provider, making it more difficult to maintain its relationships with its customers and preserve and expand its business. In some cases, these changes have also reduced the Company’s profit margins because the vendor management company is retained for the purpose of keeping costs low for the end client and receives a processing fee which is deducted from the payment to the Company.

In accordance with industry practice, most of the Company’s contracts for contract computer programming services are terminable by either the client or the Company on short notice.
PROFESSIONAL STAFF AND RECRUITMENT



In addition to using internet-based job boards such as LinkedIn, Indeed, Dice, Monster, Career Builder and Discover.org, the Company maintains a database of technical personnel with a wide range of skills. The Company uses a sophisticated proprietary computer system to match potential employees’ skills and experience with client requirements. The Company periodically contacts personnel within its database to update their availability, skills, employment interests and other matters and continually updates its database. This database is made available to the account executives and recruiters at each of the Company’s offices.



The Company employs technical personnel primarily on an hourly basis, as required in order to meet the staffing requirements under particular contracts or for particular projects. The Company primarily recruits technical personnel by posting jobs on the Internet and, on occasion, by publishing advertisements in local newspapers and attending job fairs. The Company devotes significant resources to recruiting technical personnel, maintaining 36 technical and non-technical recruiters based in the U.S. and contracting with companies for 40 to 80 offshore recruiters as needed to assist in locating both IT and administrative (non-IT) workers. Potential applicants are generally interviewed and tested by the Company’s recruiting personnel, by third parties that have the required technical backgrounds to review the qualifications of the applicants, or by on-line testing services. In some cases, instead of employing technical personnel directly, the Company uses subcontractors who employ the technical personnel who are provided to the Company’s customers. For a small fee, the Company may sometimes process payments on behalf of customers to contractors identified by the customers directly instead of through the normal recruiting process; this is known as “payrolling”.



Competition



The technical staffing industry is highly competitive and fragmented and has low barriers to entry. The Company competes for potential customers with providers of outsourcing services, systems integrators, computer systems consultants, other providers of technical staffing services and, to a lesser extent, temporary personnel agencies. Many of the Company’s competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than the Company. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in obtaining and retaining customers are accurate assessment of customers’ requirements, timely assignment of technical employees with appropriate skills and the price of services. The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified technical personnel are compensation, availability, quality and variety of projects and schedule flexibility. The Company believes that many of the technical personnel included in its database may also be pursuing other employment opportunities. Therefore, the Company believes that its responsiveness to the needs of technical personnel is an important factor in the Company’s ability to fill projects. Although the Company believes it competes favorably with respect to these factors, it expects competition to increase and there can be no assurance that the Company will remain competitive.
Intellectual Property Rights




The Company relies primarily upon a combination of trade secret, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements to protect its proprietary rights. The Company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, customers and potential customers and limits access to and distribution of its proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by the Company in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of its proprietary information or that the Company will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce its intellectual property rights.
