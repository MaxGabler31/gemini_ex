Item 1.    Business
We were initially organized as a Delaware limited liability company on June 30, 2006 in connection with the acquisition by our former principal stockholder of Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon, Inc., which owned the Del Frisco’s and Sullivan’s restaurant concepts. Following the acquisition, the company was restructured to separate certain other Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon concepts by, among other things, spinning off the subsidiaries that owned and operated those concepts. We converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation in July 2012 in connection with our initial public offering. Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to ("we," "us," "our," “Del Frisco’s” or the “Company”) refer to Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
On June 27, 2018, we completed the acquisition (the “Barteca Acquisition”) of Barteca with two restaurant concepts: Barcelona Wine Bar (“Barcelona”) and bartaco. We believe that Barcelona and bartaco are innovative concepts, which are highly complementary and will provide Del Frisco’s portfolio with significant growth and development opportunities, enabling us to capture market share in the experiential dining segment, while mitigating the effects of seasonality and the risk of economic downturns to our restaurant portfolio.
On September 21, 2018, we sold all of the outstanding equity interests in our Sullivan’s Steakhouse business (“Sullivan’s") to Sullivan’s Holding LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and affiliate of Romano’s Macaroni Grill.
Our Company
We develop, own and operate four contemporary and complementary restaurants: Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse (“Double Eagle”), Barcelona, bartaco, and Del Frisco’s Grille (“Grille”). We are a leader in the experiential dining segment based on average unit volume (“AUV”) and restaurant-level EBITDA margin. We believe the success of our brands reflect relentless and consistent execution across all aspects of the dining experience, from the formulation of proprietary recipes to the procurement and presentation of high quality menu items and delivery of a positive guest experience that leaves a lasting impression. We currently operate 73 restaurants in 16 states and the District of Columbia. The Double Eagle and Grille are positioned within the fine dining segment and are designed to appeal to both business and local dining customers. Our Double Eagle restaurants are sited in urban locations to target customers seeking a “destination dining” experience, while our Grille restaurants are intended to appeal to a broader demographic, allowing them to be located either in urban areas or in close proximity to affluent residential neighborhoods. The Double Eagle and Grille offer steaks as well as other menu selections, such as chops and fresh seafood. These menu selections are complemented by an extensive, award-winning wine list. Barcelona and bartaco are designed to provide guests with a polished experience by serving seasonal flavorful food with welcoming service in an attractive and lively atmosphere. By offering this experience at an affordable price point, we believe this generates broad appeal across a wide guest demographic. This broad appeal has enabled Barcelona and bartaco to expand to locations in a variety of markets, including urban, tertiary and college towns. We believe our success reflects consistent execution across all aspects of the dining experience, from the formulation of proprietary recipes to the procurement and presentation of high quality menu items and delivery of a positive customer experience.
Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse
We believe the Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steakhouse is one of the premier steakhouse concepts in the United States. The Del Frisco’s Double Eagle brand is defined by its menu, which includes USDA Prime grade, wet-aged and dry-aged steaks hand-cut at the time of order and a range of other high-quality offerings, including wagyu, prime dry-aged lamb, fresh seafood, and signature side dishes and desserts. It is also distinguished by its “swarming service,” whereby customers are served simultaneously by multiple servers. Each restaurant has a sommelier to guide diners through an extensive, award-winning wine list and our bartenders specialize in hand-shaken martinis and crafted cocktails. Del Frisco’s Double Eagle restaurants target customers seeking a full-service, fine dining steakhouse experience. We believe the décor and ambiance, with both contemporary and classic designs, enhance our customers’ experience and differentiate Del Frisco’s Double Eagles from other upscale steakhouse concepts. We currently operate 16 Double Eagle steakhouses in eleven states and the District of Columbia. These restaurants range in size from 11,000 to 24,000 square feet with seating capacity for at least 300 people. Additional Double Eagle openings are planned over the next year, and we anticipate they will range in size from 12,000 to 16,000 square feet. AUVs per Double Eagle for locations open the entire year were $13.6 million for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2018. During the same period, the average check at these Double Eagle locations was $123.

Barcelona Wine Bar
Founded in 1996, Barcelona Wine Bar is a neighborhood Spanish tapas bar that offers simple and elegant small plates and an award-winning wine list. The seasonal, high quality menu combines bold flavors with unique specialties from Spain and the Mediterranean. Barcelona has a superior Spanish wine program and offers an extensive selection of wines from Spain and South America, including over 40 wines by the glass. In 2018, all Barcelona restaurants won Wine Spectator’s “Best Of” Award of Excellence. We design our restaurants with the goal of creating a timeless, sophisticated and vibrant atmosphere. We currently operate 15 locations in seven states and the District of Columbia. Our typical restaurant size is approximately 4,500 square feet.  AUVs per Barcelona for locations open the entire year were $4.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2018. During the same period, the average check at these Barcelona locations was $34.
bartaco
Inspired by a healthy, outdoor lifestyle, the first bartaco location was opened in 2010. The cuisine pulls from a broad palate of bold, spicy flavors from the Mediterranean, Asia and beyond, while our handcrafted cocktails are made with artisanal spirits and freshly-squeezed juices. We aim to create the comfortable yet energetic atmosphere of a rustic beach shack in our restaurants. The minimalistic décor is light and breezy, featuring reclaimed wood, hand-woven basket lights and painted tiles. In addition, our outdoor patios feature lively bars, fireplaces and inviting seating options. We currently operate 18 locations in ten states. Our typical restaurant size is approximately 4,500 square feet. bartaco combines fresh, upscale street food with a coastal vibe in a relaxed environment. AUVs per bartaco for locations open the entire year were $5.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2018. During the same period, the average check at these bartaco locations was $23.
Del Frisco’s Grille
We developed the Grille in 2011 to take advantage of the positioning of the Del Frisco’s brand and to provide greater potential for expansion due to its smaller size, lower buildout cost and more diverse menu. The Grille has a refreshing, modern menu that draws inspiration from bold flavors and fresh ingredients. Borrowing from the Del Frisco’s heritage, it appeals broadly to both business and casual diners with the same high quality Double Eagle prime aged steaks, top selling signature menu items and a broad selection of the same quality wines. In addition, the Grille has an extensive menu creating new twists on American comfort classics, including regional flavors and locally sourced ingredients. We believe the ambiance of the concept appeals to a wide range of customers seeking a less formal atmosphere for their dining occasions. Each Grille features a bar that is the centerpiece for a great night out. In 2017, we carried out an in-depth brand analysis with a leading third party consultant to assist us in better understanding the Grille concept’s growth opportunities and target guests. We currently operate 24 Grilles in eleven states and the District of Columbia. AUVs per Grille restaurant for locations open the entire year were $5.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2018. During the same period, the average check at these Grille locations was $51.
Site Selection and Development
We believe site selection is critical for the potential success of our restaurants. We have partnered with a third party master broker to source potential sites against a set of clear criteria for each Brand. We carefully consider growth opportunities for each of our restaurant concepts and utilize a customized approach for each concept when selecting and prioritizing markets for expansion. We perform comprehensive demographic and customer profile studies to evaluate and rationalize the trade areas and sites within each desired market. We leverage a significant number of sources to produce extensive research and analysis on the dynamics of the local area, the specific attributes of each site considered and the unit economics we believe we can realize. Our evaluation process also includes working with a leading third party spatial analytics company, which has developed a customized model to determine the most attractive locations for each of our Brands and produces a predictive sales scoring package for specific sites. A Real Estate Committee, consisting of members of the Board and senior management, visits, assesses and approves each site against a set of clear criteria.  
For the Double Eagle brand, we focus primarily on sites in urban locations that allow us to easily access business clientele and customers seeking a premium dining experience. Many of our Double Eagle restaurants are in marquee locations, including waterfront property, popular shopping districts and active business centers. For our Barcelona and bartaco concepts, we focus on a mix of urban/metropolitan and suburban core locations.  We seek sites that allow us to establish a neighborhood feel where guests come to rely on us as their go to dining destination across multiple dayparts.  Wealthier, more sophisticated college towns have proven to be key target markets.  For our Grille concept, we target sites in high traffic urban and suburban locations in close proximity to affluent residential areas. Our site assessment analysis includes three primary components: customer profiling (demographics, lifestyle segmentation, spend metrics, clustering/density analysis), trade area and site evaluation (physical inspection, competitive benchmarking, analysis of business generators/traffic patterns), and financial modeling (square footage and seat count analysis, predictive sales analytics, margin evaluations, investment cost and return metrics). Understanding our customers is an essential element of our market planning and site selection processes. We have developed a customer profile model for each of our concepts to help guide our development efforts and educate our development partners.

(a)Represents the population within a customized target area generally with less than a 20-minute drive time.
(b)Represents the targeted age demographics for a prospective site.
(c)Represents the targeted average daily vehicle traffic for a prospective site.
We expect the size of new Double Eagle restaurants to range from 12,000 to 16,000 square feet, new Barcelona and bartaco restaurants to be approximately 4,500 square feet, and new Grille restaurants to range from 6,500 to 8,000 square feet. For the opening of a new restaurant, we measure our cash investment costs net of landlord contributions and equipment financing and including pre-opening costs. We target average cash investment costs of $8.0 million to $9.0 million for a new Double Eagle, $3.1 million to $3.5 million for a new Barcelona, $2.5 million to $3.0 million for a new bartaco, and $5.0 million to $6.0 million for a new Grille. For our three primary growth brands the Double Eagle, Barcelona and bartaco, we target a cash-on-cash return beginning in the third operating year of at least 40% (excluding pre-opening expense). To achieve these returns, we target restaurant-level EBITDA margins of 24% to 27% for the Double Eagle, 23% to 26% for Barcelona and 24% to 27% for bartaco.
We believe there are opportunities to open eight to twelve new restaurants annually, generally composed of two to three Double Eagle restaurants, two to three Barcelona restaurants and four to six bartaco restaurants. New openings of our Double Eagle, Barcelona and bartaco concepts will serve as the primary driver of new unit growth in the near term. During the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2019, we expect to open one Double Eagle restaurant, two to three Barcelona restaurants and three to four bartaco restaurants. We expect to open no Grilles in 2019 or 2020 as we evaluate the performance of 2018 openings which incorporate lessons learned from our 2017 consulting project. It generally takes 9 to 12 months after the signing of a lease to complete construction and open a new restaurant. Additional time is sometimes required to obtain certain government approvals, permits and licenses, such as liquor licenses.
Restaurant Operations and Management
Our restaurants have a distinctive combination of food, atmosphere and service in an upscale environment. We believe that our success reflects the consistency of our execution across all aspects of the dining experience, from the formulation of proprietary recipes, to the procurement and presentation of high quality menu items and the delivery of a positive customer experience. We strive to provide quality through a carefully controlled and established supply chain and proven preparation techniques.
Depending on the volume of each restaurant, our typical restaurant-level management team ranges from 4 to 10 people including one general manager, one executive chef and a team of assistant managers and sous chefs. We also have an experienced team of regional directors to oversee operations at multiple restaurants. To ensure that each restaurant and its employees meet our demanding performance requirements, we have developed a set of strict operational standards that are followed in all facets of our operations. For example, these standards are used to develop corporate recipes, many of which are proprietary, that are adhered to across all of our restaurants. These standards also mandate a quality control process for the menu items in each of our restaurants that our chefs and managers oversee before each shift. This quality control process includes the full preparation of each item on our menu, other than our steaks, and the testing of each of these items for presentation, taste, portion size and temperature before they are prepared for our customers. Items that do not meet our rigorous standards are re-made until they do. We believe this process of full preparation for testing differentiates us from our competition.
3

The consistent execution at our restaurants is a result of the extensive training and supervision of our employees. Our general managers are typically required to undergo at least eight to ten weeks of initial training in food quality, customer service, alcohol beverage service, liquor liability avoidance and employee retention programs. Each of our new hourly employees also typically participates in a training program during which the employee works under the close supervision of his or her general manager. Our chefs and their assistants receive extensive training in food quality, food supply management and kitchen maintenance. All of our employees are trained to uphold each concept’s distinct characteristics and our overall values and operating philosophy.
Our training programs are administered by the general manager at each restaurant and supervised by our chief people officer and a dedicated training director for each concept. This training team ensures that all new general managers have developed a comprehensive set of tools that they can use to manage their restaurant, including employee selection, performance management and wage and hourly compliance. We also require each general manager to obtain a mandatory internal certification in areas of the kitchen, dining room and bar area. Our training team also supports new restaurant openings. Each of our concepts have developed a streamlined training program that ensures employees opening a new restaurant function as a cohesive team and maintain our high operational and food preparation standards. As a result, our corporate and concept-level infrastructure supports our growth strategy, allowing us to successfully replicate our standards in new restaurants.
Sourcing and Supply Chain
Our ability to ensure a consistent supply of safe, high-quality food and supplies at competitive prices to all our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement. Our supply chain team along with a third-party consultant source product from approved local, regional and national suppliers. All suppliers must meet our food safety and quality standard requirements. We continually research and evaluate products and supplies to ensure high quality meat, seafood, produce and other menu ingredients. The company purchases beef from two main suppliers: Stock Yards, a division of U.S. Foods, Inc., and Halpern’s, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gordon Foodservice, Inc. In addition, the company has a strong distribution relationship with Distribution Market Advantage, Inc., on a national basis to ensure that our restaurants receive a constant supply of products. Supply chain management negotiates directly with suppliers of meat, seafood, produce and certain other food and beverage products to ensure availability of supply, food safety, consistent quality and freshness. 
Our Culinary leadership and supply chain establish strict product specifications for items purchased at the local, regional and national levels. Purchasing at each restaurant is directed primarily by each restaurant’s chef, who is trained in our purchasing philosophy and specifications, and who works with regional and corporate managers to ensure consistent products. Many of our restaurants also have an in-house sommelier responsible for purchasing wines based on customer preferences, market availability and menu content.
We have not experienced any significant delays in receiving restaurant supplies and equipment. Although we currently do not engage in futures contracts or other financial risk management strategies with respect to potential price fluctuations, from time to time, we may opportunistically enter into fixed price beef supply contracts or contracts for other food products or consider other risk management strategies with regard to our meat and other food costs to minimize the impact of potential price fluctuations. This practice could help stabilize our food costs during times of fluctuating prices, although there can be no assurances that this will occur.
Quality Assurance
To ensure that all restaurants provide safe, high-quality food in a clean and safe environment, we purchase only products from approved sources that meet or exceed our product specifications and standards. We rely on independent third parties to inspect and evaluate our suppliers and distributors. Suppliers are required to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) food safety programs and risk-based preventative controls adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause food-borne illnesses by applying scientifically-based controls to analyze hazards, identify and monitor critical control points, and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met. Our third-party auditors visit each restaurant regularly throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation.
Information Technology and Cybersecurity 
To provide industry best guest experience within our brands, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group leverages enterprise-class technology.  Implemented technologies act as an enabler to assist with executing our strategies. Technologies focus on enabling the business to achieve visibility and to effect improvements in areas of:  financial control, cost management, guest experience and team member effectiveness, in order to drive operational excellence. 
Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group maintains internal support through our Restaurant Support Center, based in Irving, Texas, for all restaurant level technologies, for all brands. Secondary support is regularly provided by the technologies service provider via a 
4

service level agreement.  Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group leverages various technologies to help drive operational excellence. In utilizing such tools, the access to near real-time data is essential for in-moment management.  To support restaurant level tools, encrypted data is transmitted throughout the day and night, providing timely information to all levels of the business. Our information is transmitted in a secure method to protect both our data and computing environment. We guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes storing critical business information via a hybrid strategy which includes on-site, cloud environments, replicated virtual environments, and testing plan. Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group predominantly uses commercially available software and hardware, each supported by enterprise class service providers. 
Cybersecurity and data protection remain as an area of focus for Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group.  In 2018, we invested in a company-wide network reengineering initiative.  Firewalls, switches and circuits were all upgraded and redesigned to ensure internal and external systems maintained strict segmentation and policies to safeguard data.  Del Frisco’s performs quarterly scans and reviews intrusion dashboards to proactively determine if data is at risk.  Additionally, Del Frisco’s subscribes to outside services to tokenize credit card transactions and customer data. We remain constantly vigilant of emerging risks and ever-changing compliance requirements to ensure we make strategic investments to protect company, customer and team member data.   
Marketing and Advertising
We believe that our commitment to providing quality food, hospitality, service and a high level of value for each price point is an effective approach to attracting customers and maintaining their loyalty. We use a variety of national, regional and local marketing and public relations techniques intended to maintain and build our customer traffic, maintain and enhance our concepts’ images and continually improve and refine our upscale experience. In addition, local restaurant marketing is important to the success of our concepts. For example, each restaurant’s general manager cultivates relationships with local businesses and luxury hotels that drive the restaurant’s business, in particular its private dining business. We also work with a national public relations firm that coordinates local firms in connection with new restaurant openings. The Double Eagle, Barcelona, bartaco and Grille each use specific marketing and advertising initiatives to position the concepts in the applicable segment of our industry, including advertisement placement in magazines, digital advertising and social media targeting the affluent segment of the population.
Competition
The full-service steak industry and general upscale restaurant businesses are highly competitive and fragmented, and the number, size and strength of competitors vary widely by region, especially within the general upscale restaurant segment. We believe restaurant competition is based on quality of food products, customer service, reputation, restaurant décor, location, name recognition and price. Depending on the specific concept, our restaurants compete with a number of restaurants within their markets, both locally-owned restaurants and restaurants that are part of regional or national chains. The principal competitors for our Double Eagle concept are other upscale steakhouses including local independents and chains such as Mastro’s Steakhouse, Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar, The Capital Grille, Smith & Wollensky, The Palm, Ruth’s Chris Steak House and Morton’s The Steakhouse. The principal competitors for our Barcelona concept are Toro, Jaleo, North Italia, Eureka! and Tupelo Honey Café. The principal competitors for our bartaco concept are Velvet Taco, Tortas Frontera, Superica, Xoco, True Food Kitchen and Sweetgreen. The principal competitors for our Grille concept include other upscale chains such as Hillstone, Seasons 52, Houston’s, Paul Martin’s American Grill and Earl’s Kitchen + Bar. Our concepts also compete with additional restaurants in the broader upscale dining segment. 
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations comparable to most restaurants. Historically, like other restaurants in our segment, the percentage of our annual revenues earned during the first and fourth fiscal quarters has been typically higher due to holiday traffic, increased gift card purchases and redemptions and increased private dining during the year-end holiday season. In addition, we operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending the last Tuesday of each December. In fiscal 2018, we changed to a fiscal quarter calendar where each quarter contains 13 weeks, other than in a 53-week year where the last quarter of the year will contain 14 weeks. Prior to fiscal 2018, the first three quarters of our fiscal year consisted of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks or 17 weeks in a 53-week year. The fiscal years ended December 25, 2018, December 26, 2017 and December 27, 2016, which we refer to as fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively, had 52 weeks. The following fiscal year that will end on December 31, 2019, which we refer to as fiscal 2019, will also have 53 weeks.
Intellectual Property
We have registered the names Del Frisco’s, Double Eagle Steakhouse, Barcelona Wine Bar, bartaco and Del Frisco’s Grille and have applications pending to register certain other names and logos as trade names, trademarks or service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in certain foreign countries. We have the exclusive right for use of these trademarks throughout the United States, other than with respect to the following. A third party that operates a single restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky has an exclusive license to use Del Frisco’s name within a 50-mile radius of Louisville, Kentucky. We do not have any 
5

right to any future or recurring payments from or have any affirmative payment obligations to the third party and they are responsible for all costs associated with running their respective location, including all commodity and labor costs and any risks related thereto. In fiscal 2016, we entered into an agreement to obtain and clarify the naming rights in certain counties in Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio related to this unrelated third party for aggregate consideration of $0.6 million. We are also aware of names similar to those of our restaurants used by various third parties in certain limited geographical areas. We believe that our trade names, trademarks and service marks are valuable to the operation of our restaurants and are important to our marketing strategy.
Government Regulation
Our restaurants are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local health, safety, fire and other authorities, including licensing and regulation requirements for the sale of alcoholic beverages and food. We maintain the necessary restaurant, alcoholic beverage and retail licenses, permits and approvals. The development and construction of additional restaurants will also be subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. Federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws regulate, among other things, minimum wage, overtime, tips, tip credits, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, health insurance, citizenship requirements and other working conditions. Our restaurants are subject in each state in which we operate to “dram shop” laws, which allow, in general, a person to sue us if that person was injured by an intoxicated person who was wrongfully served alcoholic beverages at one of our restaurants. A judgment against us under a dram shop law could exceed our liability insurance coverage policy limits and could result in substantial liability for us and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our inability to continue to obtain such insurance coverage at reasonable costs also could have a material adverse effect on us. We are also subject to the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment.
Celebrating Life in The Community
A significant part of “Celebrating Life in Restaurants”, from extraordinary events to those everyday moments with friends and family, to supporting our team members' journeys in their celebration of life, comes from our investment to the communities where we are located, to those in need, and to our team members and guests.  We believe quality service extends beyond our restaurants and into the larger community. Our love for what we do fuels our passion for providing support to causes close to our heart.
St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital ®
We are thrilled to partner with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital®. We believe our national partnership with St. Jude will benefit both organizations and those in the communities in which we have a presence. “Celebrating Life in Restaurants” starts with celebrating life and is intended to ensure children live to see the other side of childhood cancer.
Veteran Roasters
Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group is paying back our veterans in need one cup at a time. We have partnered with Veteran Roasters Cup O’ Joe, a company that serves the bigger cause of ending homelessness and unemployment for veterans, while roasting incredible coffee. Veterans have defended our freedom, and we are thrilled to be able to support those who put their lives on the line for our safety. 
CitySquare
CitySquare’s partnership with Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group manifests itself in many ways. CitySquare has been the beneficiary of the DFRG 5K Walk & Run for the past three years. It is a way for DFRG employees to give back and raise community awareness of the issues of poverty in Dallas. Beyond the financial support, leftover collateral including t-shirts, swag bags, and food items go to CitySquare programs to meet ongoing needs. The food is distributed through the Food Pantry and the reusable bags and t-shirts are available for any of the neighbors who are in need. For the last two years, Del Frisco’s Restaurant Group has also sponsored CitySquare’s annual “A Night to Remember” event with proceeds raised to support its mission of feeding the hungry, healing the sick, housing the homeless and renewing hope in the heart of Dallas. DFRG employees have also supported CiySquare by hosting coat drives to prepare for the winter, hiring hospitality graduates at DFRG restaurants, and providing the meal for the annual AmeriCorps Brunch, a celebration of the CitySquare AmeriCorps members who donate their time and skills to fight poverty. 
DFRG Employee Support Fund
The DFRG employee support fund was created in 2016 to help our Team Members in times of need when suffering from a catastrophic event in their life resulting in financial hardship. Financial assistance granted from the DFRG FEED fund is a gift, not a loan and is not required to be paid back.

Employees
As of December 25, 2018, we had approximately 6,595 employees. Many of our hourly employees are employed on a part-time basis to provide services necessary during peak periods of restaurant operations. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
